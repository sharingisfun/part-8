It goes beyond basic concepts and basic definitions to teach students how to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, and link the information they are learning. It offers readers opportunities for higher-order learning, while preparing students to become careful evaluators of information, as well as adept problem solvers. Organized by disorder groups and theme, Language Disorders in Children, 2/e helps students easily make connections between theoretical information and clinical practice through a number of thoughtful features such as case histories, clinical decision trees, and hot topic discussions. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an approach that meets the needs of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s students to learn lifetime critical thinking skills, to see relationships between isolated ideas and facts, and to think like a speech-language pathologist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dfc50eb078afc99cde6d50c7de37e35e0e95342","amp;dn":"Language+Disorders+in+Children%2C+2E-+Kaderavek+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dfc50eb078afc99cde6d50c7de37e35e0e95342","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,252,80,235,7,138,252,153,205,230,213,12,125,227,126,53,224,233,83,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
