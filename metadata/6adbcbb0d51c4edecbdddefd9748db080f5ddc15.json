Created by the prolific producer who worked with legends including George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic, AMPLIFIED FUNK is packed with custom samples of guitar and bass licks, chords, vintage keys and synths, pianos, percussion, vocals, and more. Electronic instrument samples add a contemporary edge for modern producers, and exclusive presets for MASSIVE and the MASCHINE Drum Synths wrap 30 years of music into one funked-up expansion.\n\nPUTTING IT TOGETHER\n\nFunk and soul specialist Amp Fiddler compiled all the live samples for AMPLIFIED FUNK in his Camp Amp studio. Among the sampled instruments were vintage drums, a vintage Roland Jupiter-6 and Moog Memorymoog, and a baby grand piano. Instrumentalists recorded for the session include guitarist Chris Bruce, and members of Funkadelic, guitarist Andre Ã¢â‚¬ËœFoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Williams and percussionist Larry Fratangelo. To add a contemporary edge, Amp also created custom sounds with MASSIVE and the MASCHINE Drum Synths.\nAMPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S PLAYLIST\n\nAmp Fiddler put together a Spotify playlist of must-listen tracks that inspired AMPLIFIED FUNK to ignite the funk inside you.
