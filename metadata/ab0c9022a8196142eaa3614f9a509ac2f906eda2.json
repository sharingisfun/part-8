He has never been the tallest. Or the best at gym. Or the greatest artist. Or the most musical. In fact, Albie has a long list of the things he's not very good at. But then Albie gets a new babysitter, Calista, who helps him figure out all of the things he is good at and how he can take pride in himself.\n\nA perfect companion to Lisa Graff's National Book Award-nominated A Tangle of Knots, this novel explores a similar theme in a realistic contemporary world where kids will easily be able to relate their own struggles to Albie's. Great for fans of Rebecca Stead's Liar and Spy, RJ Palacio's Wonder and Cynthia Lord's Rules.\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Family | Humor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0c9022a8196142eaa3614f9a509ac2f906eda2","amp;dn":"Lisa+Graff+-+Absolutely+Almost+%28retail%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0c9022a8196142eaa3614f9a509ac2f906eda2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,12,144,34,168,25,97,66,234,163,97,79,154,80,154,194,249,6,237,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
