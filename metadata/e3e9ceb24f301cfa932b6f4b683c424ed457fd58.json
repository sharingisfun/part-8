It is unique in its focus on American quotations and its inclusion of items not only from literary and historical sources but also from popular culture, sports, computers, science, politics, law, and the social sciences. Anonymously authored items appear in sections devoted to folk songs, advertising slogans, television catchphrases, proverbs, and others.\n\nFor each quotation, a source and first date of use is cited. In many cases, new research for this book has uncovered an earlier date or a different author than had previously been understood. (It was Beatrice Kaufman, not Sophie Tucker, who exclaimed, I ve been poor and I ve been rich. Rich is better! William Tecumseh Sherman wasn t the originator of War is hell! It was Napoleon.) Numerous entries are enhanced with annotations to clarify meaning or context for the reader. These interesting annotations, along with extensive cross-references that identify related quotations and a large keyword index, will satisfy both the reader who seeks specific information and the curious browser who appreciates an amble through entertaining pages.  \n\n\nHardcover: 1104 pages\nPublisher: Yale University Press; illustrated edition edition (October 30, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0300107986","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e9ceb24f301cfa932b6f4b683c424ed457fd58","amp;dn":"The+Yale+Book+of+Quotations+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e9ceb24f301cfa932b6f4b683c424ed457fd58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,233,206,178,79,48,28,250,147,43,111,75,104,60,66,78,212,87,253,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
