It is a follow-up to the Long Way Round trip of 2004, when the pair rode east from London to New York via Eurasia and North America.\n\nThe journey started on 12 May 2007 and finished on 4 August 2007. They were accompanied by the same key members of the team from Long Way Round, including cameraman and directors of photography Claudio Von Planta and Jimmy Simak (who also oversaw music supervision and soundtrack production), producers Russ Malkin and David Alexanian. In addition they decided to travel constantly with a medic, Dai Jones, security officer Jim Foster and various &quot;fixers&quot; - local guides and interpreters - throughout the journey. They rode the BMW R1200GS Adventure, the successor to the R1150GS Adventure bikes they rode in Long Way Round.\n\nThe team traveled from their base in Olympia, London to John o' Groats at the northern tip of Scotland to begin their journey. The European leg of the journey ended in Sicily, where they caught a ferry to Tunisia.\n\nFrom Tunisia they rode into Libya. However, American producer David Alexanian and cameraman Jimmy Simak were unable to obtain the necessary entry visas and were forced to fly from Tunisia to Egypt where they rejoined the team. After visiting the pyramids they boarded a ferry and traveled to Sudan, continued into Ethiopia and then into Kenya, where they crossed the equator. From Kenya they rode to Uganda and then Rwanda, where they had an audience with President Paul Kagame. They went from there to Tanzania, and then into Malawi, where they were joined by Ewan McGregor's wife Eve. The final leg of the trip took them through Zambia, Namibia, Botswana and finally into South Africa. The journey ended at Cape Agulhas, the most southerly point on the continent, to where they were accompanied from Cape Town by a phalanx of bikers, similar to their arrival in New York on the Long Way Round journey.\n\n\n1)  Episode 1 \nFollow Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's journey from Scotland to Africa on motorcycles as their team prepares for the trip.\nThis episode: practicing for a hostage situation; Ewan breaks his leg.\n\n2)  Episode 2 \nEwan McGregor and Charley Boorman's journey to Africa continues, as they make their way from John O'Groats to Siena.
