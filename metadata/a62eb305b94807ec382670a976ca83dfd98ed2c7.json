The band enjoyed \nsome chart success, including the UK and Canadian hits &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; (1979) and\nSenses Working Overtime&quot; (1982), but are perhaps even better known for their long-standing \ncritical (rather than commercial) succes\n\nEarly years: 1972ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1977\n\nFirst coming together in 1972, the core duo of Andy Partridge (guitars &amp; vocals) and Colin \nMoulding (bass &amp; vocals) went through many band names (including The Helium Kidz and Star \nPark) over the next five years. As the Helium Kidz, they were featured in a small NME article \nas an up-and-coming band from Swindon. Drawing influence from the New York Dolls, particularly \nthe &quot;Jetboy&quot; single and the emerging New York punk scene, they played glam rock with homemade \ncostumes and slowly built up a following. Drummer Terry Chambers joined in 1973. Keyboard player \nJonathan Perkins followed, replaced by Barry Andrews in 1976, and the band finally settled on \na name: XTC.\n\n\n\n   1.
