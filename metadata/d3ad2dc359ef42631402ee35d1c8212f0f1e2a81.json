Lela knows thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only one explanation: the Mazikin have arrived in the land of the living.\n\nNeeding to maintain the appearance of a normal life for her foster mother, her probation officer, and her classmates, Lela returns to Warwick High along with Malachi. At night they secretly hunt for the Mazikin nest. To assist, two new Guards from very different parts of the Shadowlands are assigned to LelaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unit, including the bad boy Jim, who repeatedly challenges Lela's authority. Lela struggles to keep all her Guards on the right side of the law, but their mistakes come at a terrible cost.\n\nAs one painful revelation follows another and the Mazikin start targeting those closest to her, Lela finds herself more vulnerable than sheÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever been, wanting a future more than she ever has. With an enemy determined to separate soul from body, one question remains: how much is she willing to sacrifice to protect those she loves?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3ad2dc359ef42631402ee35d1c8212f0f1e2a81","amp;dn":"Sarah+Fine+Fractured+Guards+of+the+Shadowland+2+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3ad2dc359ef42631402ee35d1c8212f0f1e2a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,173,45,195,89,239,66,99,20,2,238,53,209,200,33,47,15,30,42,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
