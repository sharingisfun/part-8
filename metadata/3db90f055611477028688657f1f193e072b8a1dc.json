I shall be active as often as possible but NOT 24/7.\n\nap20110401 THE LOTTERY TICKET, Donna Franceschild.mp3\nap20110404 MY LIFE IS A SERIES OF PEOPLE SAYING GOODBYE.mp3\nap20110405 DEJA VU, Alexis Zegerman.mp3\nap20110406 EARLY BELT AND THE PRESENT, Richard Pitt.mp3\nap20110408 PHUMZILE, Matthew Hurt.mp3\nap20110411 THE AFGHAN AND THE PENGUIN, Hastings.mp3\nap20110412 TITANIUM, Anita Sullivan.mp3\nap20110413 JELLY BABIES, Judy Upton.mp3\nap20110415 POURING POISON, Lou Ramsden.mp3\nap20110418 CHARITY, Daniel Jamieson.mp3\nap20110419 THE SENSITIVE-A CASUALTY OF WAR.mp3\nap20110425  TEN LESSONS IN LOVE.mp3\nap20110426 THE VERTIGO TRUST.mp3\nap20110427 COUNTRYSIDES, Anita Sullivan.mp3\nap20110429 THE STATE OF THE ART, Iain M Banks.mp3\n\nfp20110401  THE CAIRO TRILOGY 3-3, Naguib Mahfouz.mp3\nfp20110408 CHOICE OF STRAWS, ER Braithwaite.mp3\n \nsp20110402 ONE CHORD WONDERS 1 PARALLEL LINES.mp3\nsp20110409 ONE CHORD WONDERS 2  BLITZKRIEG BOP.mp3\nsp20110416 ONE CHORD WONDERS 3  DAMNED DAMNED.mp3\nsp20110423 ONE CHORD WONDERS 4 THIS IS THE MODERN WORLD.mp3\nsp20110430 ONE CHORD WONDERS 5 TELEVISION'S OVER.mp3\n\nDonleavy :-)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db90f055611477028688657f1f193e072b8a1dc","amp;dn":"BBC+Radio+Plays+2011-04%28Apr%29+Donleavy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db90f055611477028688657f1f193e072b8a1dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,185,15,5,86,17,71,112,40,104,134,87,241,241,147,224,114,184,161,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
