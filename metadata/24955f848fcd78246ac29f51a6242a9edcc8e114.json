This installment shows how to use PHP to convert measurements such as length, area, volume, mass, speed, and temperature into different units. The exercises are ideal for new PHP developers who want to gain experience building PHP projects, as well as for experienced developers who want to practice their skills.â€¨â€¨Along the way, series designer Kevin Skoglund introduces coding strategies, refactoring techniques, and useful skills including dynamically generating form select-option values and formatting decimal numbers and scientific notation.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tConverting length and area measurements\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing functions to avoid repetition\r\n\tâ€¢\tRefactoring to produce simpler code\r\n\tâ€¢\tConverting volume and mass\r\n\tâ€¢\tGenerating form select-option values dynamically\r\n\tâ€¢\tFormatting scientific notation\r\n\tâ€¢\tConverting speed and temperature\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24955f848fcd78246ac29f51a6242a9edcc8e114","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Easy+PHP+Projects%3A+Measurement+Conversion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24955f848fcd78246ac29f51a6242a9edcc8e114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,149,95,132,143,205,120,36,106,194,159,81,166,36,42,158,220,200,225,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
