An exiled Russian, he has an elegant apartment in Berlin, where he has been living for years. He drives a snazzy little car ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a convertible. He is married to Lydia (Andrea FerrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ol), a not-so-smart but devoted and absolutely desirable woman. The administration of his firm only keeps him busy a few hours a day. Business stagnates. Presumably a result of the global economic crisis that does not really upset Hermann. Recently, Hermann has the feeling that he could leave his body, step beside it and observe himself. One evening he leaves the living room door open so he, who sits in the living room, can observe how he and Lydia make love. This state of being becomes an addiction for him. He would love to perfect his ability to double himself, would like to bring it to an extreme and to refine it, like it was a creative gift. On a business trip, Hermann meets the tramp Felix (Klaus LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶witsch). He is convinced that Felix is identical to him in all his physical details and they agree to stay in touch by mail (general delivery). Although the existence of his double at first irritates Herman, it becomes a source of inspiration to him after he returns home. What would it be like if he could disappear in order to begin a new life as someone else? Herman plans the perfect and gratifying rebirth for which a tramp is to die ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ his journey towards light.\n\n_____________________________\n\n\nDVDrip\n\nFilesize: 1396MB (1464721408 bytes)\nVideo: XVID 640x384 23.98fps 1407Kbps 0.239bpp [Video 0]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 192Kbps [Audio 1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5064858367496538e4cb1c674c8b3777a37987f8","amp;dn":"Despair+%28Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder%2C+1978%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5064858367496538e4cb1c674c8b3777a37987f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,100,133,131,103,73,101,56,228,203,28,103,76,139,55,119,163,121,135,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
