Martin Woods of Chillbase describes Liquid Stranger's music as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œunique blend of Ambience, Big Band Jazz, Dubstep and Psychedelica drizzled over electronic Dub Reggae grooves.\n\nThe Liquid Stranger Project: 2003ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2009\n\nMartin StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤f launched the Liquid Stranger project in 2003. His intention was to have one alias that would encompass all his musical output. Consequently, he has produced a wide variety of music under the name Liquid Stranger. At first, StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤f's plan was to keep his identity a secret. He never did interviews or showed his face on stage. StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤f states: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½After a while it became quite tricky. in fact, Interchill finally ruined this idea by writing my name on the record sleeves.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Liquid Stranger's creative output ranges from suggestive Ambient soundscapes to movie scores, pop, dub, infernalia, drill n bass, and electronica.\n\nThe first release under the name Liquid Stranger was the song Environmental Meltdown, featured on the compilation Global Psychedelic Chill Out - Compilation Vol. 4 by Spirit Zone Recordings.\n\nWhen asked in an interview why he moved away from the trance scene, StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤f replied: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½I never really switched per se, I have always made tons of different types of music. During the time I toured with Necton, I produced various stuff like Ambient, Electro and Drill n bass. What excites me is the fusing of genres. I have no fixed style that I stay with too long, I do not like boundaries.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLiquid Stranger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Arcane Terrain Album\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. The Molecule Man\n02.
