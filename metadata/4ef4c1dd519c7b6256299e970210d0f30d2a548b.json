Weeks away from closing for good, she calls on Chef Robert Irvine for a rescue. Robert immediately identifies the tasteless barbecue, poor service and the fact that Tootie's isn't bringing in the lunch crowd as the problems causing the restaurant's downfall. Robert has just two days to give Eileen a second chance at success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef4c1dd519c7b6256299e970210d0f30d2a548b","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Impossible.S08E02.A.Lot.To.Lose.PDTVx264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ef4c1dd519c7b6256299e970210d0f30d2a548b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,244,193,221,81,156,123,98,86,41,158,151,2,16,208,243,13,42,84,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
