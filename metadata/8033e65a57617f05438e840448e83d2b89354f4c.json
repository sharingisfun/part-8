As GPUs find their way into mobile phones, handheld gaming devices, and consoles, GPU expertise is even more critical in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s competitive environment. Real-time graphics programmers will discover the latest algorithms for creating advanced visual effects, strategies for managing complex scenes, and advanced image processing techniques. Readers will also learn new methods for using the substantial processing power of the GPU in other computationally intensive applications, such as scientific computing and finance. Twenty of the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forty-eight chapters are devoted to GPGPU programming, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Written by experts in cutting-edge GPU programming, this book offers readers practical means to harness the enormous capabilities of GPUs.\nMajor topics covered include:\nGeometric Complexity\nShading, Lighting, and Shadows\nHigh-Quality Rendering\nGeneral-Purpose Computation on GPUs: A Primer\nImage-Oriented Computing\nSimulation and Numerical Algorithms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8033e65a57617f05438e840448e83d2b89354f4c","amp;dn":"GPU+Gems+2+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8033e65a57617f05438e840448e83d2b89354f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,51,230,90,87,97,127,5,67,142,132,4,72,232,61,43,137,53,79,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
