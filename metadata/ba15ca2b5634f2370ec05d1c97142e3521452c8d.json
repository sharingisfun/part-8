A citizen of Carthage and military commander in Punic Spain, he famously marched his war elephants and huge army over the Alps into RomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own heartland to fight the Second Punic War. Yet the Romans were the ultimate victors. They eventually captured and destroyed Carthage, and thus it was they who wrote the legend of Hannibal: a brilliant and worthy enemy whose defeat represented military glory for Rome.\n\n In this groundbreaking biography Eve MacDonald expands the memory of Hannibal beyond his military feats and tactics. She considers him in the wider context of the society and vibrant culture of Carthage which shaped him and his family, employing archaeological findings and documentary sources not only from Rome but also the wider Mediterranean world of the third century B.C. MacDonald also analyzes HannibalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legend over the millennia, exploring how statuary, Jacobean tragedy, opera, nineteenth-century fiction, and other depictions illuminate the character of one of the most fascinating military personalities in all of history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba15ca2b5634f2370ec05d1c97142e3521452c8d","amp;dn":"Hannibal%3A+A+Hellenistic+Life+%282015%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba15ca2b5634f2370ec05d1c97142e3521452c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,21,202,43,86,52,242,55,14,192,93,28,151,20,46,53,33,69,44,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
