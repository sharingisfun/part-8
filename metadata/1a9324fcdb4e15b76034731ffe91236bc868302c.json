The son of the original Starman, Ted Knight, Jack was never supposed to be the hero, but after his brother's death he takes up the Starman mantle reluctantly. \n\n\nUnlike other DC heroes, he does not wear a flashy costume, but wears a tshirt, sneakers and his favorite jacket,goggles, with a sheriff's star being the only symbol of his superhero status\n\nConsidered one of the few gems of the 90s, this is definitely worth reading. Enjoy and seed\n\nPS this will be a long initial download. Expect to see it finished Monday or so","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9324fcdb4e15b76034731ffe91236bc868302c","amp;dn":"Starman+v2+01-80%2C81+%281994-2001%2C2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9324fcdb4e15b76034731ffe91236bc868302c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,147,36,252,219,78,21,183,96,52,115,31,254,145,35,107,200,104,48,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
