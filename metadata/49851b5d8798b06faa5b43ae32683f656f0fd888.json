A three-CD box that covers 13 tracks, the most noticable absences are &quot;Surf&amp;#039;s Up,&quot; &quot;Our Prayer,&quot; and &quot;Cabinessence,&quot; none of which are represented.  Also, Heroes and Villains gets short-shrifted in it&amp;#039;s representation, with parts one and two getting some coverage, but much, much more is simply AWOL.  But enough complaining.  Giving the fans far more Smile than has ever been available before, and in such good sound and layout (forget the booklet, it&amp;#039;s filled with errors and sloppy writing), this is a collectors dream.  Containing tracks for &quot;H&amp;V&quot;, &quot;Bicycle Rider,&quot; &quot;Do You Like Worms,&quot; &quot;The Old Master Painter,&quot; &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; &quot;He Gives Speeches,&quot; &quot;Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Child is Father of the Man,&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; &quot;Vege-Tables&quot; (the track with the most representation), &quot;Mrs. O&amp;#039;Leary&amp;#039;s Cow,&quot; &quot;Friday Night,&quot; and &quot;Water,&quot; there are no &amp;#039;lost&amp;#039; songs here, meaning that all of the tracks have at least in part been on other boots, but this collection simply has more of the sessions that has ever been previously available.  There are no overt signs that Brian is near a state of collapse, (although compared with previous sessions, he appears more impatient, and more prone to change his mind) and the sheer musical invention found here is worth the cost of acquisition.\n\n\nUnsurpassed Masters Vol. 17 (1966-1967)\n\nSmile Sessions     C 9950\n\nAll tracks are stereo, except * indicated are mono.\n\n \nDisc 1\n \n1.
