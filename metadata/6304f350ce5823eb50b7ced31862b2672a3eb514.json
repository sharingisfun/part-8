The latter did in fact encourage him, after having been twigged to an upcoming radio broadcast of the Piano Quintet.\r\n\r\nEnglund's Second Symphony, The Blackbird, does indeed feature a blackbird, its call heard on flute. But as it was composed in 1948, right after the devastations of WWII, there's a lot more going on beneath the surface of this work. The bird's innocence is played off against the world, and as music critic Heikki Aaltoila wrote, the symphony seems &quot;a sarcastic statement by a rebellious soul on the brutality of Man and our distorted civilisation, compared with the purity of Nature.&quot; It was a theme and its treatment Englund, who lived very close to nature, would return to again and again throughout his career. \r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio is enclosed.
