(THIS MEANS YOU DONT NEED TO CRACK IT)You: OO NOW I GET IT. PLEASE COMMENT AND SEED PLEASE!!!\n\n\n----------------------------------Review----------------------------------------------\nWho would have thought that the lowly marble would spawn an entire genre of games? While mainstream developers scramble to create quirky characters that spew pointless catch phrases Monster Studios and Garage Games have returned to the simple magic of rolling a featureless ball around an elevated platform. Yet, in the end I would rather take a singleble Blast Gold? over a hundred and Daxters.\n\nGarage Games currently has 2 marble games in their catalogue and yet, other than the central theme of the marble, both games couldnt be more different. The object of Marble Blast Gold is to roll your marble (using a keyboard / mouse combination) around various platforms until you reach the end marker. Each map offers unique challenges such as collecting gems and power-ups, which must be fulfilled before you can successfully finish the level. Occasionally there is a sadistically short time constraint, my least favorite element.\n\nThe controls are simple enough that even a non-computer user can figure them out and that is part of what I found so endearing about Marble Blast Gold. This truly is a game for everyone in the family. The beginner levels are actually just tutorials for various controls and obstacles in the game, most of which I was able to chew through in under 10 seconds each, but they allow kids and non-gamers time to build up the skills necessary to tackle the advanced levels. And no matter how much of an expert gamer you think you are, the advanced levels are going to kick your ass!\n\nWhile most users will be Windows based its good to see a game made available simultaneously on Windows, Mac and Linux - and its a tribute to the versatility of the Torque engine. With the included 100 levels and the (albeit dodgy) ability to make your own levels you get well more than your moneys worth when it comes to Marble Blast Gold.\n\nGraphics: 8\nThe graphics are bright and colorful with a very strong cleverness feeling to them - and I mean that in a good way. The textures lack detail and the geometry is a little rough in places but the bright cartoony graphics are a welcome relief for PC gaming and give the Marble Blast just the right personality.\n\nYou have the option to switch between DirectX and OpenGL graphics although I found the switching process somewhat glitchy. Once I switched to DirectX I was unable to go back to OpenGL as the frame rate would drop to the single digits and the game became unplayable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ only a complete reinstall of the game allowed me switch back. In my opinion the OpenGL graphics looked better and seemed to offer a better frame rate, also the dynamic shadow option did not appear to work well (at all?) in DirectX. Unless you absolutely have to switch, I would recommend staying with the default - OpenGL.\n\nSound: 8\nThe sound effects are good though perhaps a little subdued. I was expecting the audio to reflect the bright, garish feel of the graphics with loud over the top sounds like a Warner Brothers cartoon. Instead there are fairly standard sound cues for the ball movement and various power-ups, very little in the way of environment sound. The background music is very light and suits the game well.\n\nGame play: 9\nMarble Blast offers great console-styled game play on your PC. The array of power-ups and interactive environments give plenty of variety but never overwhelm or overshadow the extremely simple core of the game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ roll your marble around the board and don't fall off.\n\nThe core of any game of this style is its physics implementation and here they have a good feel to them and are fairly forgiving (you can change directions in mid-air), you rarely feel like you are spinning completely out of control. In fact you pretty much feel like you are always just on the edge of losing control but a steady hand usually bring your marble back in line; the perfect feeling for this kind of game.\n\nThe difficulty of the included levels fills a range between way too easy and completely impossible, which means that there is more than likely enough game play here for anyone in the family ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ regardless of gaming experience. My only complaint is that the levels must be played in the order presented. If you get permanently stuck on one of the advanced levels (like I have) then the game play basically stops until you or someone else finish it. I would have much preferred a system where you can clear the levels in the order of your choosing.\n\nOptions: 7\nThe player is given a respectable amount of control over the game including the ability to adjust resolution, bit-depth, adjust sound and remap the game controls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ all fairly standard for any 3D arcade game on the PC.\n\nThe option to switch between DirectX and OpenGL graphics is welcome although probably unnecessary given that the Torque engine OpenGL performance and quality seems so much better. As mentioned before I would have preferred the ability to play the maps out of sequence, especially at the advanced level.\n\nConcept: 8\nThis is the second marble game released from Garage Games this year (the other being Orbz, reviewed earlier) and there are more than a few others in development elsewhere. Marble Blast Gold could have very easily been rushed out as a clone of Orbz or Super Monkey Ball but instead the developers offered some original twists and brilliant map design. The final product is both familiar and yet fresh at the same time.\n\nThe marble genre itself is still fairly young, with lots of unexplored potential. I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for this style of game.\n\nFun: 9\nThis game can be especially harrowing for those (like me) with a fear of heights. The vertigo can be extreme on some levels and I found myself sweating bullets on more than one occasion, whimpering like a little girl as I tried to guide my marble across a particularly treacherous platform. Note to self: donÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t play this game with your girlfriend watching!\n\nThere are maps here that drove me to the brink of insanity and I swore I would quit and never touch the game ever again and then I would try again, just one more time. If you've ever been completely addicted to an arcade or console game then you know the feeling I'm talking about and Marble Blast Gold delivers that experience flawlessly.\n\nOverall: 9\nConsidering the bright, cheery graphics, dead-on physics control and the brilliant level design. No mystery as to how a game like Marble Blast Gold is so addictive. The beginner and intermediate levels suck you in with their simplicity only to make you want to pull your hair out on the advanced.\n\nMarble Blast Gold is another great entry into the marble? genre and a showpiece for the Torque engine. Highly recommended!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01405774fc7dc9da6b5001ae6b9034a7a6564127","amp;dn":"Marble+Blast+Gold+Pre-Cracked_16spendl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01405774fc7dc9da6b5001ae6b9034a7a6564127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,64,87,116,252,125,201,218,107,80,1,174,107,144,52,167,166,86,65,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
