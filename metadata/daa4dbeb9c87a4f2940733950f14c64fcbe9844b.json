A bit over played and under acted but   \n  saved by the sage advice (and liberal sexuality) of the &quot;heroine&quot;, Elke   \n  played convincingly by the enticing Shauna O'Brien. Griffen Drew is       \n  delectable as Linda, the put-upon new wife, while Lisa Boyle is her       \n  usual vixen-like self as the rejecting daughter.The sex scenes are        \n  tasteful and erotic but lack emotion and passion, as is so often the      \n  case in this genre of soft core films. Still the morale fiber is kind of  \n  unique and the ending holds a bit of interest as everything comes         \n  together and the future looks considerably brighter for all concerned.    \n                                                                            \n  \n                       ..  ..                     b! \n \n                     &quot;your one-stop shop for E.T. porn&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa4dbeb9c87a4f2940733950f14c64fcbe9844b","amp;dn":"Friend.Of.The.Family.1995.DVDRip.x264-CG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa4dbeb9c87a4f2940733950f14c64fcbe9844b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,164,219,235,156,135,164,242,148,7,51,149,15,20,198,79,203,233,132,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
