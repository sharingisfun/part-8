Then these \nsongs really must be from Akron performance, which only had \nsongs order like this.\n**listed as Christchurch, March 8, &amp;#039;75, which is total nonsense,\nif Lou really played in Christchurch it was in August, anyway \nthis song is from Sydney.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b647b4daed6e3fb047b2198b3398527ea3904bbf","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed+-+%5B1976-10-23%5D+Akron+%28Soundboard+Recording%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b647b4daed6e3fb047b2198b3398527ea3904bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,71,180,218,237,110,63,176,71,178,25,139,51,152,82,126,163,144,75,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
