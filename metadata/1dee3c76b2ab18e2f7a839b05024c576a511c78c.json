The only evidence that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d served in the Marines was a photograph of himself and a buddy tacked to the basement wall. On one terrifyingly memorable occasion his teenage son, Dale, witnessed Steve screaming at the photograph: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They said I killed him! But I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill him! It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t my fault!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nAfter Steve died, Dale Maharidge began a twelve-year quest to face down his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wartime ghosts. He found more than two dozen members of Love Company, the Marine unit in which his father had served. Many of them, now in their eighties, finally began talking about the war. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never spoken so openly and emotionally, even to their families. Through them, Maharidge brilliantly re-creates Love CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battles and the war that followed them home. In addition, Maharidge traveled to Okinawa to experience where the man in his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s picture died and meet the families connected to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wartime souvenirs.\n\nThe survivors Dale met on both sides of the Pacific Ocean demonstrate that wars do not end when the guns go quietÃ¢â‚¬â€the scars and demons remain for decades. Bringing Mulligan Home is a story of fathers and sons, war and postwar, silence and cries in the dark. Most of all it is a tribute to soldiers of all warsÃ¢â‚¬â€past and presentÃ¢â‚¬â€and the secret burdens they, and their families, must often bear.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nThe story of a distinguished journalist's search for his father's war. Pulitzer Prize winner Maharidge's (Journalism/Columbia Univ.; Homeland, 2011, etc.) father was a Marine sergeant who fought on Okinawa, where he suffered brain damage in an explosion that killed one of the men in his command, Herman Mulligan. Among the souvenirs the elder Maharidge brought home was an omnipresent photograph of himself and Mulligan, as well as sporadic explosive rages that terrified the author throughout his childhood. Maharidge received no diagnosis or treatment for his injury and refused to talk about the war to the end of his days. After his death, the author, &quot;a person obsessed with the past and what I could not heal,&quot; set out to discover the truth about his father's wartime experiences, learn who Mulligan was and, if possible, locate his inexplicably unidentified gravesite. He conducted interviews with almost 30 elderly members of his father's company, and he presents 12 of them at length. He also traveled to Okinawa to visit the site of his father's injury and meet with civilian survivors of the battle in an effort to lay his father's demons to rest. The result is a moving memoir of the war by someone who wasn't there but who suffered from wartime injuries just as surely as his father had. The veterans' interviews are sensitively conducted, powerful and disturbing, graphic descriptions of brutal and largely unnecessary combat with a suicidally determined enemy, and frank accounts of atrocities committed by both sides. Equally importantly, some also explore the men's difficulties in re-entering civilian life, placing in context the elder Maharidge's often unsuccessful struggles to live with his experiences among people who could not imagine or understand them. A powerful narrative of the dark side of American combat in the Pacific theater and the persistence of resulting injuries decades after the war ended.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gripping and unforgettableÃ¢â‚¬â€a sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search for his father in the shattered ruins of the Pacific WarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nNew York Post\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A scrupulous and heartfelt analysis of what it was like to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“a cog in the biggest battle in the Pacific.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMinneapolis Star Tribune\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mulligan is that rare thing: a book propelled into being by heartfelt urgency and prodigious skill, a mission truly accomplished.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dee3c76b2ab18e2f7a839b05024c576a511c78c","amp;dn":"Dale+Maharidge+-+Bringing+Mulligan+Home+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dee3c76b2ab18e2f7a839b05024c576a511c78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,238,60,118,178,171,24,226,247,168,57,176,80,36,197,118,165,17,199,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
