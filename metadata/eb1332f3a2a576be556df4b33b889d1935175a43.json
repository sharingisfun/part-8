Featuring 12 newly-recorded versions of classic Prine songs, &quot;Broken Hearts &amp; Dirty Windows: Songs of John Prine&quot; boasts an enviable roll call of inventive musicians, including My Morning Jacket, The Avett Brothers, Conor Oberst &amp; The Mystic Valley Band, Old Crow Medicine Show, and more. That Prine's perspective flourishes so vividly in these modern recastings is testament to not only the sheer power of his songs, but to the subtly defiant undercurrent that runs throughout his music.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
