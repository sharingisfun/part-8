Accompanying him in his revenge missions is his put-upon friend, Chris, who can't help but go along with Dan's wild plots to get even despite how ridiculous they may seem. The third regular character is Elise, Chris's wife, who objects to Chris's participation in Dan's revenge quests but doesn't really interfere due to being distracted with her secret operative work for the government, which often acts as a subplot to many episodes. The show is set primarily in the Los Angeles, CA, area, and background scenes often show notable landmarks in and around Los Angeles.\n\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\n\nFile Container: MP4\nVideo Format: 10-bit h.264/Mpeg4\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\n\nAudio Format: AAC\nAudio Language: English Stereo\n\nSubtitle Format: SRT\nSubtitle Lanuage: English\n*Subtitles are only on Seasons 1 and 3 (big thanks to [url=&quot;http://www.addic7ed.com&quot;]http://www.addic7ed.com[/url])\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfca0587afb358d895148ace6cd963675767db82","amp;dn":"Dan+Vs.+Seasons+1%2C+2%2C+%26amp%3B+3+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfca0587afb358d895148ace6cd963675767db82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,202,5,135,175,179,88,216,149,20,138,206,108,217,99,103,87,103,219,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
