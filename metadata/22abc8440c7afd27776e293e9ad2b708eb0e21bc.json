The idea was to make story-based music with a heavy and melodic sound. In 2009 Drummer Tobias Gustafsson and his brother Fredrik Gustafsson (bass) joined Inner Sense and completed the current line-up.\n\nIn 2010 the band recorded three songs with producer Daniel Flores at Sound vs. Science Studios and the chemistry that was found with Daniel, helped them to find their sound.\n\n\nGenre:  Gothic Metal\n\nBand:\tInner Sense\n\nAlbum:\tLife Sentence\n\n2015:\t2015\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
