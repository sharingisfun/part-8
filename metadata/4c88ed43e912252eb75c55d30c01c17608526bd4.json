In recent decades, fieldwork has led to new research directions, allowing us to reevaluate classical archaeology as a distinct field generating its own research questions. This book compiles case studies of current fieldwork in the Greek world (ca. 800-100 B.C.), considering new data and approaches in shaping a discourse in Greek archaeology.\n\nAbout the Authors\nDonald C.
