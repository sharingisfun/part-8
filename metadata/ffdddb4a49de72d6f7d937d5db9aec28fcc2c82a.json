Placing her eggs in the basket of her husband's career instead, she becomes ambitious for him. She is very creative about it, including &quot;working on&quot; his boss, in the classic femme-fatale fashion.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck is certainly a perfect casting for her part in this love-triangle, housewife-gone-mad noir. Excellent depictions of the claustrophobic inanity of 1950's middle-class family life: I can imagine this one kept a few husbands up at night.\n\n\n***********\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffdddb4a49de72d6f7d937d5db9aec28fcc2c82a","amp;dn":"Crime+of+Passion+%281957+film+noir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffdddb4a49de72d6f7d937d5db9aec28fcc2c82a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,221,219,74,73,222,114,214,247,217,55,213,219,154,236,40,252,194,200,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
