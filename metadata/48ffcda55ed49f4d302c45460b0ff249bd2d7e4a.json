Written by Ruth Rendell; Full-cast dramatisation; Dramatised by Mike Walker.\n\nIt is 1979 and hapless accountant Arthur and his wife Gwen have made a new friend.\n\nFlashy novelist Reeve is everything they're not - carefree, charismatic and seemingly irresistible.

Reece Shearsmith\nGwen ...... Laura Pyper\nReeve ...... Michael Maloney\nOther parts are played by Rachel Atkins and David Holt\n\nSound Design: Steve Bond\n\nDirected by John Dryden\nA Goldhawk Production for BBC Radio 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ffcda55ed49f4d302c45460b0ff249bd2d7e4a","amp;dn":"Ruth+Rendell+-+People+Don%27t+Do+Such+Things+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ffcda55ed49f4d302c45460b0ff249bd2d7e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,255,205,165,94,212,159,77,48,44,69,70,11,15,242,73,189,45,126,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
