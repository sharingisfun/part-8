My name is Casey Kasem.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey gets a letter saying he made a mistake when he reported Tommy James' &quot;Crimson And Clover&quot; as the song which took the biggest fall when exiting the hot 100 (from number 18). Turns out the title for &quot;Biggest Dropper&quot; actually belonged to &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot; by the Moody Blues, which fell from number 17 completely off the chart in 1972.\n\nMaureen McGovern's song, &quot;Morning After&quot; debuts at number 29. Out of at least a dozen songs able to hit number one on the pop chart and win an Academy Award for best song, this is the only one to receive its Oscar first (as reported by Casey on his June 13th, 1981 show).\n\nThe only instrumental to hit number one so far in 1973 is at number 27; &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by the Edgar Winter Group.\n\nCasey says, &quot;There is a re-release of a former number one record by an artist who got his first hit by doing a voice imitation of an actor who became famous by playing a character who couldn't speak a word&quot; (I had a better understanding of what was going on before Casey made that statement than afterwards). \n\nCasey reads a fan letter from Paul Gambaccini who was a British correspondent for Rolling Stone magazine concerning his 1973 interview with Elton John. Gambaccini declares his adorations of Casey who in turn has nothing but compliments for Gambaccini (and if you listen closely, you can hear someone on the AT40 staff checking to see if &quot;Kumbayah&quot; had moved up a notch).\n\nFinally, an edited Pink Floyd claims spot number 17 with &quot;Money&quot; - their breakthrough song that earned them plenty of what they were singing about. It is from their legendary album, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; - so I'm sharing my copy of the documentary, &quot;The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Get it in either ISO or AVI format. Links are in the notepad text.\n\n[Much to my surprise, I was able to include the video torrent files in this file I am sharing (If it had caused the universe to implode, I would have said I was sorry)!]\n\n40: Plastic Man - Temptations\n39: Swamp Witch - Jim Stafford\n38: I'll Always Love My Mama - Intruders\n37: Brother Louie - Stories\n36: Going Home - The Osmonds\n35: Why Me - Kris Kristofferson\n34: If You Want Me To Stay - Sly &amp; The Family Stone\n33: Where Peaceful Waters Flow - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n32: I Believe In You, You Believe In Me - Johnny Taylor\n31: Get Down - Gilbert O' Sullivan\n30: I'm Doin' Fine Now - New York City\n29: Morning After - Maureen McGovern\n28: Satin Sheets - Jeannie Pruitt\n27: Frankenstein - Edgar Winter Group\n26: Feeling Stronger Every Day - Chicago\n25: Misdemeanor - The Sylvers\n24: Daddy Could Swear, I Declare - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\n23: One Of A Kind Love Affair - Spinners\n22: Doin' It To Death - Fred Wesley &amp; The J.B.'S\n21: Touch Me In The Morning - Diana Ross\n20: The Monster Mash - Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett\n19: So Very Hard To Go - Tower Of Power\n18: Pillow Talk - Sylvia\n17: Money - Pink Floyd\n16: Behind Closed Doors - Charlie Rich\n15: I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little Bit More, Baby - Barry White\n14: Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy Of Company B - Bette Midler\n13: Diamond Girl - Seals &amp; Crofts\n12: Natural High - Bloodstone\n11: Long Train Runnin' - Doobie Brothers\n10: Right Place, Wrong Time - Dr. John &amp; The Night Trippers\n9: My Love - Paul McCartney &amp; Wings\n8: Smoke On The Water - Deep Purple\n7: Playground In My Mind - Clint Holmes\n6: Yesterday Once More - Carpenters\n5: Give Me Love - George Harrison\n4: Shambala - Three Dog Night\n3: Bad Bad Leroy Brown - Jim Croce\n2: Kodachrome - Paul Simon\n1: Will It Go Round In Circles - Billy Preston","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d717edc84338194601599ecf1eb1fb65670e19","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_July_14th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d717edc84338194601599ecf1eb1fb65670e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,215,23,237,200,67,56,25,70,1,89,158,207,30,177,251,101,103,14,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
