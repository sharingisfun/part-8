It is the sequel to the successful 1994 film The Mask, an adaptation of Dark Horse Comics which starred Jim Carrey. The film had an $84 million budget and $57.6 million worldwide box office gross.\nIt also stars Alan Cumming as the god of mischief, Loki, whom Odin has ordered to find the Mask. It co-stars Traylor Howard, Kal Penn, Steven Wright, and Bob Hoskins as Odin. Ben Stein makes a quick reappearance as Dr. Arthur Neuman from The Mask to reestablish the relationship with the mask and Loki. The film was widely panned by critics. It won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Remake or Sequel.\nUnlike the first film which was more adult oriented, this film is a family film as the film's tone is much lighter and more comical than the first one's darker tone.\n\n\nDimensione: 1,501 MB (or 1,537,744 KB or 1,574,649,856 bytes)\nDurata: 01:32:00 (138,007 fr)\n\nVideo Codec: DivX\nVideo Bitrate: 1892 kb/s\nRisoluzione: 656x368 (1.78:1) [=41:23]\nFPS (Frames/sec): 25.000\nQF (Frame quality): 0.313 bits/pixel\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s (96/ch, stereo) CBR \nFreq Audio:48000 Hz\n\n\nDivX DRF Analyzer v0.9.5 Report!\nFile Name: D:\\temp\\Son of the Mask.avi\nFourCC: DX50\nCodec: DivX503b1338p\nResolution: [ Width: 656 Height: 368 ]\nFrame Rate: 25.000 frames per second\nThe Video has 138007 frames [ 01:32:00 ]\n\nAverage Frame quality is Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â MEDIUM\t[Average DRF/quantizer is 3.23]\nStandard Deviation: Quality is HIGH\t[Std.
