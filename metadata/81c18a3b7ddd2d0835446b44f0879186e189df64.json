Preserving recipes like Marinated Baby Artichokes are followed by recipes for dishes like Marinated Artichoke and Ricotta Pie and Sausages with Marinated Baby Artichokes; a Three-Citrus Marmelade recipe is followed by recipes for Chicken Wings Baked with Three-Citrus Marmelade, Shrmp with Three-Citrus Marmelade and Lime, and Crepes with Three-Citrus Marmelade, and so on. \nIn this book, Eugenia Bone, a New Yorker whose Italian father was forever canning everything from olives to tuna, describes the art of preserving in an accessible way. Though she covers traditional water bath and pressure canning in detail, she also shares simpler methods that allow you to preserve foods using low-tech options like oil-preserving, curing, and freezing. Bone clearly explains each technique so that you can rest assured your food is stable and safe. \nWith Well-Preserved: Recipes and Techniques for Putting Up Small Batches of Seasonal Foods, you will never again have a night when you open your cupboard or refrigerator and lament that there's &quot;nothing to eat!&quot; Instead, you'll be whipping up the seasons' best meals all year long.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c18a3b7ddd2d0835446b44f0879186e189df64","amp;dn":"Well-Preserved+Recipes+and+Techniques+for+Putting+Up+Small+Batch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c18a3b7ddd2d0835446b44f0879186e189df64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,193,138,59,125,221,45,8,53,68,107,68,240,135,145,134,225,137,223,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
