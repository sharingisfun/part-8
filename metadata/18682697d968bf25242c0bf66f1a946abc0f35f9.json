He wasn&amp;#039;t looking for a career in comic books, but was quickly offered steady work in that medium ÃƒÂ¢?? a series of ten-page gag vehicles for Donald Duck and his nephews in Walt Disney&amp;#039;s Comics &amp; Stories. The first appeared in the 31st issue (April, 1943), and Barks continued writing and drawing them until 1966. In this series, Barks developed Donald&amp;#039;s character far beyond the one-dimensional bundle of irascibility seen in the animated version.\n\n\nI always felt myself to be an unlucky person like Donald, who is a victim of so many circumstances. But there isn&amp;#039;t a person in the United States who couldn&amp;#039;t identify with him. He is everything, he is everybody; he makes the same mistakes that we all make. He is sometimes a villain, and he is often a real good guy and at all times he is just a blundering person like the average human being, and I think that is one of the reasons people like the duck.&quot;\n(Carl Barks, taken from 1975 and 1981 quotes)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18682697d968bf25242c0bf66f1a946abc0f35f9","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Donald+Duck+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18682697d968bf25242c0bf66f1a946abc0f35f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,104,38,151,217,104,191,37,36,44,11,246,111,26,148,106,188,15,53,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
