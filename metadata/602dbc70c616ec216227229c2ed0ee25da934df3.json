After the untimely death of the much-liked Emperor Trajan, the despotic Emperor Arruntius has bled the once powerful Rome to its knees. Badly fought wars, famine and plague are rife in all corners of the Empire, whilst the Emperor and his elite enjoy every excess and vice that the emptying coffers can afford. As herald to this age of degradation, Arruntius has destroyed large portions of the city of Rome to create the battleground for the bloodiest gladiator event ever staged. You are but an enslaved combatant in this bloodsport, but with gory kills, fantastic stunts, and finishing moves, you can become a hero to the crowd. From the streets of Rome to the paradise of Elysium, become the champion of all gladiators and win your freedom.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Burn DISK1.iso on a CD or mount it on a virtual drive;\n2) Run setup.exe and install the game (it will ask you to insert the second disk during the installation process);\n3) Extract Crack.zip archive to where you installed the game (overwrite original file);\n4) Play the game without the discs.\n\n!
