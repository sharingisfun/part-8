He wants to go to celestial realms but instead altruistically returns to the unifactor to undo a wrong he has inadvertently brought about: The transformation of the evil politician Whim into a mind-destroying plant-demon who distorts and enslaves Frank and his friends. The new and metaphysically expanded Manhog sets out for a final battle with Whim...\n\nWeathercraft also co-stars Frank's cast of beloved supporting characters, including Frank's Faux Pa and the diminutive, mailbox-like Pupshaw and Pushpaw; it is both a fully independent story that is a great introduction to Woodring-s world, and a sublime addition to, and extension of, the Frank stories.\n\nAlso by Jim Woodring\n\nJim V1 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571874/Jim_Woodring_-_Jim_V1_The_Book_of_Jim_(Fantagraphics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571874/Jim_Woodring_-_Jim_V1_The_Book_of_Jim_(Fantagraphics)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJim V2 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571886/Jim_Woodring_-_Jim_V2_(Fantagraphics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571886/Jim_Woodring_-_Jim_V2_(Fantagraphics)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrank &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571847/Jim_Woodring_-_Frank_(Fantagraphics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7571847/Jim_Woodring_-_Frank_(Fantagraphics)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTantalizing Stories &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7709447/Tantalizing_Stories_-_Jim_Woodring__Mark_Martin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7709447/Tantalizing_Stories_-_Jim_Woodring__Mark_Martin&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBlue Block &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8010042/Blue_Block_(Jim_Woodring__Scott_Deschaine)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8010042/Blue_Block_(Jim_Woodring__Scott_Deschaine)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd click on his name in the tags up above for more books by Jim, or featuring his work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19966788f6f055f2cda3ab0a0a6140d03ff6ab22","amp;dn":"Jim+Woodring+-+Weathercraft+A+Frank+Comic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19966788f6f055f2cda3ab0a0a6140d03ff6ab22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,150,103,136,246,240,85,242,205,163,171,10,10,97,64,208,63,246,171,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
