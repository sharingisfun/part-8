He later performed professionally in the \nLos Angeles area, helping to pay his way through college. In the late 60s, \nhe relocated to Canada where he opened for Gordon Lightfoot and worked \nwith the band Lighthouse.\n   In the early 70s, Franks taught undergraduate music courses and \nearned a Ph.D for his studies in contemporary songwriting. He scored a \nnumber of films, worked with blues legends Sonny Terry and Brownie \nMcGhee and in 1972 recorded the single &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Seem To Shake This Rock \n&amp; Roll,&quot; followed a year later by his self-titled debut album. In 1975 he took \non a music research project for Warner Bros. Records, which led to his \nsigning to Reprise. His first album for the label, The Art of Tea, was released \nin 1976. It featured The Crusaders as Franks&amp;#039; backing band and contained \nthe hit &quot;Popsicle Toes.&quot;\n   Franks&amp;#039; follow-up album, Sleeping Gypsy, was released in early 1977. \nProduced by Tommy LiPuma, it highlights eight Franks originals show-\ncasing a spacious, lilting jazz/pop sound. The album&amp;#039;s musical motif was \ninspired by Franks&amp;#039; continuing interest in Brazilian music, resulting in such \nstandout cuts as &quot;Down In Brazil&quot; and &quot;Antonio&amp;#039;s Song.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd80d89135ddaf4764d50d6e6ebd94b284e70db","amp;dn":"Michael+Franks+-+Sleeping+Gypsy+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd80d89135ddaf4764d50d6e6ebd94b284e70db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,216,13,137,19,93,218,244,118,77,80,214,230,235,217,75,40,78,112,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
