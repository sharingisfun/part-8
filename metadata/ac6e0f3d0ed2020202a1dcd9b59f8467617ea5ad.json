Focusing on the design and implementation of the operating system itself Ã¢â‚¬â€ not on the applications and tools that run on it -- this book compares and analyzes the alternatives offered by several important UNIX variants, and covers several advanced subjects, such as multi-processors and threads. Compares several important UNIX variantsÃ¢â‚¬â€highlighting the issues and alternative solutions for various operating system components. Describes advanced technologies such as multiprocessor and multithreaded systems, log- structured file systems, and modern memory architecture. \n\n&quot;There are more flavors of UNIX than most brands of ice cream.&quot; Thus begins the herculean task of elucidating and describing the design and implementation of the OS itself, the internals of SVR4, 4.4BSD and OSF/1. Discusses SunOS, Solaris, DEC OSF and HP-UX, no AIX. Explains the process and kernel, threads, job control, scheduling, inter-process communication, multiprocess synchronization, file systems (distributed and advanced), memory management, architecture, device drivers, streams and I/O. Good reference sections, clean exposition, assumes familiarity with UNIX. Recommended companion volume is &quot;The Magic Garden Explained - The Internals of Unix System V&quot; by Goodheart. A very good exposition of UNIX SVR4 internals only. \n\n----------------------\nPaperback: 601 pages\nPublisher: Pearson; 1 edition (November 2, 1996)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0131019082\nISBN-13: 978-0131019089","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6e0f3d0ed2020202a1dcd9b59f8467617ea5ad","amp;dn":"UNIX+Internals%3A+The+New+Frontiers%2C+by+Uresh+Vahalia+%5BDjVu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac6e0f3d0ed2020202a1dcd9b59f8467617ea5ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,110,15,61,14,210,2,2,2,161,220,217,181,159,132,103,97,126,165,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
