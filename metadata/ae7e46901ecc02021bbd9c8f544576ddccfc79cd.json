The creator of The Civil War and Jazz achieves reverent harmony with the magnificent story of Missouri-born author Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain), encompassing legend and fact with an exhilarating sense of adventure. Hailed by Hemingway as the originator of American literature, Twain (a nom de plume taken from a riverboat pilot&amp;#039;s term for &quot;safe waters&quot;) viewed himself as the American. Burns&amp;#039;s film backs that claim as it follows Clemens&amp;#039;s literary odyssey around the globe, from unrivaled acclaim as a writer to near destitution and the devastating deaths of his wife and three children. As usual, eloquent writers and scholars (including longtime Twain performer Hal Holbrook) provide a wondrous flow of anecdotes and observations, recounting Twain&amp;#039;s remarkable humor while acknowledging a darker side that felt anger toward an indifferent god. Like all of Burns&amp;#039;s films, Mark Twain is must-see viewing. --Jeff Shannon \n\nNew York Times\n&quot;An original biographical tribute to Twain, an extravaganza of singing, acting, and dancing.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae7e46901ecc02021bbd9c8f544576ddccfc79cd","amp;dn":"Ken+Burns+-+Mark+Twain+AVIus+all+DVD+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae7e46901ecc02021bbd9c8f544576ddccfc79cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,126,70,144,30,204,2,2,27,189,156,143,84,69,118,221,204,252,121,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
