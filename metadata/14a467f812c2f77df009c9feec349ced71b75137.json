Can we have it all?\n\nAlex Soojung-Kim Pang, a renowned Stanford technology guru, says yes. THE DISTRACTION ADDICTION is packed with fascinating studies, compelling research, and crucial takeaways. Whether it's breathing while Facebook refreshes, or finding creative ways to take a few hours away from the digital crush, this book is about the ways to tune in without tuning out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a467f812c2f77df009c9feec349ced71b75137","amp;dn":"The+Distraction+Addiction%3A+Getting+the+Information+You+Need+and+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a467f812c2f77df009c9feec349ced71b75137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,164,103,248,18,194,247,125,240,9,201,254,236,52,156,237,113,183,81,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
