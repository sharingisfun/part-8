With the addition of HD visuals, gameplay\nenhancements and new extra content, it is the ultimate 3D &quot;Worms&quot;\ncollection\n\nFeatures\n\nEXTENSIVE SINGLE-PLAYER CONTENT:\nA vast array of single-player content spanning the very best of the 3D\n&quot;Worms&quot; games, ranging from shooting challenges to speed runs, whilst a\ncollection of crazy missions, interspersed with newly fully voiced\nnarrative FMV sequences, make up the single-player campaign.\nAdditionally, a huge number of challenges ask the player to master the\nindividual skills of the game (such as piloting a Jetpack or steering a\nParachute) in order to complete tasks such as target shooting or\ncollecting targets, all against the clock.\n\nONLINE AND LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER:\nFull online play for up to 4 players over a wealth of game modes such\nas &quot;Statue Defend&quot;, &quot;Homelands&quot; or just plain &quot;Deathmatch&quot;, plus the\nability to create your own custom game settings to play against your\nfriends Because of the turn-based nature of the game, it can be played\nmulti-player offline on one screen.\n\nFight on the randomly generated landscapes, even save and share them,\nwhich allows for a huge amount of multi-player map options\n\nGET COMPETITIVE:\nPlay standard or ranked games in a bid to scale the Steam Leaderboards\n\nMASSIVE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:\n\nPlayers are able to name their teams, choose which hats they want their\nworms to wear, whether they wear glasses, have moustaches, what they\nsay, which flag represents them, and even what gravestone they leave\nbehind when they die.\n\nWORMS WEAPONS AND UTILITIES:\nMany of the classic Worms weapons are present and correct, with the\nHoly Hand Grenade, Bazooka, Dynamite, Banana Bomb, Baseball Bat, Super\nSheep and many more in your arsenal of destruction.\n\nThere is also a sprinkling of even more crazy and surreal weapons too,\nsuch as Alien Abduction, Fatkins Strike, Flood, Inflatable Scouser,\nOld Woman, Starburst and Bovine Blitz with which to wage war on your\nenemies.\n\nCUSTOM BUILT WEAPONRY:\nPlayers are also able to construct their own weapons from a wide\nselection of components. These weapons are added to the players\narsenals and remain secret until deployed, giving opponents a nasty\nshock.\n\nTALK TRASH:\nIn-game voice-chat so you can cheer on team mates or indeed win the\nbattle against opponents verbally\n\nFULLY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS:\nDeform everything in real-time.\n\nNEW PICTURE-IN-PICTURE DISPLAY:\nThis tracks every action a player makes when attacking, whilst at the\nsame time allowing the player to retreat and not miss a single moment\nof the glorious action.\n\nNUMEROUS GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS &amp; ENHANCEMENTS\nNew camera enhancements make it easier to follow the action optimized\nAI means more intelligent enemies, and the addition of speech and\nlip-synching to the single-player missions makes for even more\ncinematic fun\n\nNew visual improvements, with dynamic real time lighting and post\nprocess effects and shaders, make the mayhem look even more impressive.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n2.
