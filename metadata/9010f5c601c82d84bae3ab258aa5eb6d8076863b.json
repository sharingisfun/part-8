This was their choice. I have been an amateur musician for years, and have probably played in the orchestra for Messiah 30-40 times. I was hugely impressed by the choir's singing in this version. They sang with life, with sparkle, with an energy not usual associated with this music. I have listened to the choruses many times, and have yet to tire of them. I suspect this interpretation is not for a traditionalist, but if you are a enjoy the Messiah and can accept something different, this is a good investment.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9010f5c601c82d84bae3ab258aa5eb6d8076863b","amp;dn":"The+Messiah+-+Handel+-+Jacobs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9010f5c601c82d84bae3ab258aa5eb6d8076863b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,16,245,198,1,200,45,132,186,227,171,37,138,165,235,109,128,118,134,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
