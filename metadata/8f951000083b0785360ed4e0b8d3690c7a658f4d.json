In the late 1990s, he moved to New York City, where he became a regular at the Comedy Cellar, before relocating to Los Angeles, in the hopes of finding greater fame. &quot;I tap danced like you wouldn't believe... trying to get something,&quot; he said in a 2008 interview with Ron Bennington . &quot;I'm telling you, if I'd have had a gun back then, I would have shot myself.&quot; His inability to achieve success on other people's terms motivated him to prioritize his own integrity first. &quot;At the end of the day I just want to know that I was true to myself.&quot; Later in his career, Patrice would walk away from successful shows like The Office, Arrested Development, Web Junk 20, and a writing position on the WWE. &quot;I'm a professional bridge-burner,&quot; O'Neal stated in an interview.\n\nUnwilling to yield to the demands of American club owners that he change his often confrontational act, O'Neal relocated to the United Kingdom to work on his comedy there. He worked harder as an outsider and a foreigner to gain the respect of his peers. &quot;It took about 5 months... for them to go 'Ok, this guy's not playing around,'&quot; he told Bennington. It was also during this time that he caught the eye of British comedian Ricky Gervais, still early in his stand-up career.[9] Gervais frequently mentioned O'Neal as a favorite comic. He returned to the New York area in 2002 when he got the offer to do his first half-hour special for Showtime. Later that year he joined the cast of The Colin Quinn Show and then Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. The following year, he recorded a Comedy Central Presents special.\n\nO'Neal had many guest appearances on television. His first television appearance was on The Apollo Comedy Hour where he performed his Malcolm XXL bit. From there, he moved on to appearances on Showtime at the Apollo, FNight Videos, and a brief stint as a writer for the WWE. He appeared in guest-starring roles on MTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Apt 2F, Assy McGee, Ed, Z Rock, Yes Dear, Arrested Development, Chappelle Show and The Office. O'Neal was a regular on the Fox series The Jury, and he starred in the Comedy Central animated program Shorties Watching Shorties, along with Nick DiPaolo. He supplied the voice of Harold Jenkins on NogginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s animated program O'Grady High and was featured as Jesus in Denis LearyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Searchlight. In 2005, O'Neal filmed a half-hour One Night Stand special for HBO, and shortly thereafter became the first host of VH1's Web Junk 20. O'Neal left the show after two seasons, expressing concerns that the show's audience was too different from his own. In 2006 and 2007 he joined Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, playing large outdoor concert arenas across the country.\n\nSince his move back to New York in 2002, O'Neal became a recognized radio personality as a regular guest and occasional co-host on the Opie and Anthony program. Along with Bill Burr and Robert Kelly, he filled in as co-host for comedian Jim Norton while Jim filmed Lucky Louie. From 2006 to 2008, O'Neal hosted a call-in relationship advice show on XM Radio, which ended when the satellite network merged with rival Sirius. Initially promoted as Bitch Management, the show was titled The Black Philip Show, a reference to Dr. Phil. Dante Nero co-hosted, and a rotating cast of female comedians played third mic. The show aired until the station suspended much of its Saturday night programming when they were unable to reconcile budget concerns with the new management following the merger. O'Neal had also appeared as a guest on other radio shows such as Alex Jones along with numerous political talk shows on the Fox News channel.\n\nLiving in the New York area, O'Neal performed at comedy clubs in the area, including headlining appearances at Comix comedy club and Caroline's. He was also popular in Montreal, making five appearances at the Just for Laughs festival, including one of the most memorable in fest history: a one-man, one-week show at ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢tre Ste. Catherine in 2008. O'Neal had also been slated to do five sold-out, one-man shows at Les Katacombes at the 2010 Just for Laughs Festival, but he was refused entry into Canada at the U.S. border and the shows were cancelled.\n\nIn February 2011, Comedy Central aired his first hour-long special, Elephant in the Room. He eventually began a web series and podcast called The Patrice Oneal Show - Coming Soon! showing various episodes as of May 15, 2007. He performed with a five-person groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Bryan Kennedy, Dante Nero, Vondecarlo Brown, Harris Stanton and Wil SylvinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½touching on many fictional scenarios. The show was produced by For Your Imagination and can be found on O'Neal's website. He guest-starred in another For Your Imagination-produced show, called Break a Leg, playing Adult-Sized Gary Coleman. O'Neal voiced Jeffron James in Grand Theft Auto IV, on an in-game radio show, Fizz!.\n\nOn September 19, 2011, Patrice was one of the many roasters at the Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen. This would be his final television appearance before his death two months later. O'Neal's final recorded interview was with Jay Mohr on his &quot;Mohr Stories&quot; Podcast #17, uploaded October 27, 2011, shortly after news of his stroke.\n\nShortly after O'Neal's death, BSeen Media announced the release his first album, to be released in February 2012. It was recorded at the D.C. Improv.[16] Although announced after his death, the album had been completed before his illness, with the comedian's full involvement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f951000083b0785360ed4e0b8d3690c7a658f4d","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Patrice+O%5C%27Neal+-+Mr.+P+%5B2012%5D+V2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f951000083b0785360ed4e0b8d3690c7a658f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,149,16,0,8,59,7,133,54,14,212,224,184,211,105,12,122,101,143,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
