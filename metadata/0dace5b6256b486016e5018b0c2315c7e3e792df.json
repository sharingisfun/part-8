Arrangement is by region, and each animal is covered in a four-page entry combing text with a &quot;Key Facts&quot; box and strong visuals, including photographs, maps, and artwork. Like the earlier work, this one lacks research aids such as further-reading lists. In addition, there is no explanation of why the 50 animals were selected; in fact, some of them &quot;may seem quite mundane,&quot; as the brief introduction notes. Nevertheless, the topic and the presentation will appeal to students. Also available as an e-book. Grades 6-10. --Mary Ellen Quinn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dace5b6256b486016e5018b0c2315c7e3e792df","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+the+World%5C%27s+Strangest+Animals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dace5b6256b486016e5018b0c2315c7e3e792df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,172,229,182,37,107,72,96,22,229,1,139,12,35,21,199,227,231,146,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
