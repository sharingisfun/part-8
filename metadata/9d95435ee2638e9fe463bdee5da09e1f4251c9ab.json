His contemporaries are familiar historical figures: Julius Caesar, Caesar Augustus, Herod the Great, Pontius Pilate. It was an era of oppression, when every man, woman, and child answered to the brutal rule of Rome. In this world, Jesus lived, and in this volatile political and historical context, Jesus died?and changed the world forever.\r\nAdapted from Bill O'Reilly's bestselling historical thriller Killing Jesus, and richly illustrated, The Last Days of Jesus is a riveting, fact-based account of the life and times of Jesus.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/47ful67fp/Bill.jpg\r\nBill O'Reilly was raised on Long Island, got his BA in history from Marist College, a Master's in Broadcast Journalism from Boston University, and a second MA in Public Administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
