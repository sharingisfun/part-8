In Saudi Arabia, the existence of Christian churches is prohibited, along with the Bible itself; no Christian or Jew can enter Mecca or Medina lest their mere footsteps desecrate IslamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s holiest sites. In Pakistan and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Muslim world, conversion from Islam to Christianity is punishable by death. In Iraq, Syria, Nigeria and even the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved Indonesia, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and other Ã¢â‚¬Å“infidelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ often face acts of religious genocide by fundamentalists who invoke core Islamic texts and teachings to justify their actions.\nIn short, as Robert Spencer shows in this work, the creed of Muhammad, far from being a religion of peace, has revealed itself in the post-9/11 world to be a religion of bigotry.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nRobert Spencer is the director of Jihad Watch, a program of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and the author of eight books on Islam and jihad. Spencer is a weekly columnist for Human Events and the website Front-Page Magazine, and has led seminars on Islam and jihad for the United States Central Command, United States Army Command and General Staff College, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and the U.S. intelligence community","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a18a7ab08b97ae99833c512537a53ce3e43bc3a6","amp;dn":"Islam%3A+Religion+of+Bigots+-+Robert+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a18a7ab08b97ae99833c512537a53ce3e43bc3a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,138,122,176,139,151,174,153,131,60,81,37,55,165,60,227,228,59,195,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
