First published in 1950 it has been out of out of print for many years. \n\nI found the book on the net as a pdf on some site but the text was scanned as pictures so it looked like shit and it was a was huge file. so I loaded up an OCR software and converted the whole thing to text and saved the pictures one by one. \n\nFigure 8 is missing and I don&amp;#039;t have it. The page it was on was missing in the original pdf I downloaded. I got the text on that page from some post on a forum so I hope it is correct. \n\nAnyway... read, enjoy and help me spread this to fellow boxing fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b577cf91004f5b785079bbd7e42537762e1865","amp;dn":"Boxing+manual+-+Championship+Fighting+by+Jack+Dempsey+%281950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b577cf91004f5b785079bbd7e42537762e1865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,181,119,207,145,0,79,91,120,80,121,187,215,228,37,55,118,46,24,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
