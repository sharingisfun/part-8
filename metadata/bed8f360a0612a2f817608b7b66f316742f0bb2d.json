Will correctly answer any ap25 challenge eliminating need for dae.bin to create a backup. \n\n- No need to make new backups everytime dae.bin is updated on console \n\nTopology Data \n------------- \n\nWhen ap25 was first introduced I devised a way of calculating any challenge which I called \nthe silver bullet which I made reference to a long time ago. \n\nThis was withheld until it was absolutely necessary. It was easier to replay the fixed challenges. \n\nWith unique per console ap25 challenges it has become necessary to use the silver bullet. \n\nA series of measurements are taken across the disk. This topology data is then used to calculate a response to any ap25 challenge. \n\nIt is very important that the drive used to create the topology data is reliable at reading discs as bad topology data equals bad ap25 responses. \n\nLiteon drives using 0800 v3 seem to be more accurate for this purpose. \nOnly ap25 enabled titles require topology data. \nActivation of ap25 on older non-ap25 games although technically possible is highly unlikely. \n\nCurrently topology data for xgd3 titles are similar and topology data from one xgd3 title will \npass on another xgd3 title although this is not advisable. \n\nPer title title topology data is best as there are slight differences between titles and newer titles \ncould have different topology than existing ones. \n\n\nI would like to wish everyone a merry xmas and a happy new year. I look forward to the challenges ahead. \n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process. \nThanks also go to Team Xecuter for their support to this project.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed8f360a0612a2f817608b7b66f316742f0bb2d","amp;dn":"c4eva%5C%27s+iXtreme+LT%2B+3.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed8f360a0612a2f817608b7b66f316742f0bb2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,216,243,96,160,97,42,47,129,118,8,183,182,111,49,103,66,240,187,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
