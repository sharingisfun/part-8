So enjoy =)\n\n\nStoryline---\nTRON 2.0 is based upon the movie from Disney made in 1981 called TRON (I\\&amp;#039;ve added\na torrent for that movie aswell, worth watching) where a digitization technology\nmakes analog into digital, which means that a person can enter the computer world.\nKevin Flynn gets unwillingly digitized in the movie, and helps the program TRON, \ncreated by his best fren Alan Bradley, destroys a rouge self-learning AI program\ncalled the Master Control Program, or MCP from terrorising the computer world.\n\n20 years later, Jethro, or just Jet Bradley, son of Lora and Alan Bradley is\nfollowing his fathers footsteps and has entered the world of programing.\nInside the computer an email script is being presented to Thorne\n\nScript\t\t: Please, i have to get back to my routing. I\\&amp;#039;m already behind on my\n\t\t  deliveries this cycle.\nThorne\t\t: You have privileges i require\nScript\t\t: I\\&amp;#039;m just a simple email script, I\nThorne\t\t: I know what you are, and i know what you\\&amp;#039;ll become...\n\tWHOOOOOSH\nScript\t\t: Aaaahh.... ouch, oh, ah, ohh...\nThorne\t\t: Tell me, what is your function?\nInfected script\t: I serve Thorne, my master User\n\nMeanwhile in the real world...\n\n*Blip, blip* - Game sounds coming from an arcade machine labeled TRON being played\nby Jet\n\nLab worker : Jet, do you think your dad would mind if i had some of his popcorn?\nJet\t   : Huh? Oh sure, have all you want... -loses game being distracted-\n   *phone rings*\nJet\t   : yeah?\nAlan\t   : I\\&amp;#039;m a little surprised you turned down the level six programing\n\t     position\nJet\t   : ...Look dad, I know you\\&amp;#039;re disappointed-\nAlan\t   : Damn right I\\&amp;#039;m disappointed!  ...I pulled a lot of strings to get you\n\t     that offer.\nJet\t   : I\\&amp;#039;m happy making games. Life is short, pop. I plan to enjoy it.\nAlan\t   : You sound just like Flynn\n\n  Alan pushes a buton but suddenly a sound comes from his\n  computer alerting of an error.\n\nAlan\t   : Ma3a (mathrea), run a security diagnostic.\nMa3a\t   : Yes, Alan One\n(Jet is recognized as Alan Two, as father and son is not a known term in computers)\n-Results?\n-A Virus has entered the system via e-mail. Lab drives one, two and four infected\n-Jet, we\\&amp;#039;ll have to continue this conversation later...\n *knocking or more like banging on the door\\&quot;\n-This is a restricted area, you just can\\&amp;#039;t come barging in here\n-Dad?\n-Get your hands off me-\n-Dad, can you hear me?\nbeep beep beep - the phone has been hung up...\n\nJet rushes to the lab and can\\&amp;#039;t find his dad or the intruders anywhere.\n-Ma3a, where\\&amp;#039;s my father?\n-Alan two, i require imediate assitance\n-What dou you mean?\n-Contingency Protocol Activated\n*Laser activity in five seconds.\n-Ma3a, stop what you\\&amp;#039;re doing!\n*Put on gogles*\n*Clear digitizing bay*\n*Put on gogles*\n-AAAHH---\n\n\n\nJet  : Ma3a?
