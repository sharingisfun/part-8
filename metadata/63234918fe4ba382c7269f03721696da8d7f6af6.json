The nine-track album was released in the US on March 14, 2006. It was very well received by fans as well as the press, scoring 83 points at metacritic.com.\n\nAdditional musicians performing on the album include drummer Keith Carlock, guitarists Wayne Krantz, Kenny Wessel, Jon Herington, Hugh McCracken, Ken Emerson, clarinetist Lawrence Feldman, pianist Ted Baker and saxophonist Walt Weiskopf, among others.\n\nThe album, a mental rumination of death and old age, blends Fagen's patented storytelling and groove-oriented, backing vocal-laden style. &quot;H Gang&quot; is the lead single.. The album was released as an audio CD, a vinyl record and a Special Edition CD/DVD. The DVD features versions of the album in Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1 playable on DVD-Video players and high-resolution stereo and surround tracks for DVD-Audio players. The 5.1 mix won the 2007 Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album. \n\nFagen embarked on a twenty-date studio tour (with the Donald Fagen Band) on March 1, 2006; nearly two weeks before the release of the album itself. Fagen performed songs from his latest album, his earlier solo work, as well as classic Steely Dan favorites. The tour was his first solo tour &quot;since high school.&quot; The dates left out many areas along the USA's eastern seaboard and its south/southeast regions, leading some fans to correctly surmise that Fagen would join partner Walter Becker on a summer Steely Dan tour.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63234918fe4ba382c7269f03721696da8d7f6af6","amp;dn":"Donald+Fagen...Morph+the+Cat%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63234918fe4ba382c7269f03721696da8d7f6af6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,35,73,24,254,75,163,130,199,38,159,3,114,22,150,218,141,127,106,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
