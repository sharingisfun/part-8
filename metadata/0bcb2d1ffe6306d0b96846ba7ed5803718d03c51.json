The reason why it is called witchcraft and not wizard craft is that it was mostly practiced by women in ancient times. So in a way, witch craft is usually associated with women. Another reason was that women stayed at home while the men went out to earn their living. These women helped the people especially women of their community in curing their diseases. Witchcraft, in fact, was known as the The Craft of the Wise. It was so called because those who practised it lived close to the nature and cured the diseases of the people, a service that nobody else could render. Because these witches stayed close to nature, they over a period of time, were able to decode the healing properties of various herbs and plants. Witchcraft faced the ravages of time and slowly it began to be considered evil. There were times in history when many women were burnt to the stake for practicing witchcraft. All this was largely due to superstition. Witchcraft is actually a craft and not a religion. The religion that the witches follow is called Wicca. Since the basic principles and beliefs of witchcraft are also followed in Wicca, therefore, witchcraft is generally identified with religion. Witches work their craft either alone or in groups called covens. The main benefit of working alone is that you can initiate yourself into witchcraft on your own and start practising immediately. You do not have to wait for people in the coven to initiate you. The benefit of working in a coven is that you get to learn a lot from the experience of other members. A collective worship evokes more powerful energy -magic- than individual worship. Witches know the power of prayers, worship and rituals and they use them to solve problems that afflict the people. They did so in the past and they continue to do so in the present. For example, they understand the power of positive affirmations -chants- that are often used in prayers. When used with focus and concentration, the affirmations acquire powerful energy. A special kind of environment is created, which is conducive to the performance of worship. Witches, for example, burn fragrant candles and incense, draw circles as they utter chants and perform their rituals. The combined impact of these practices works like magic.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nKEYWORDS (TAGS): Draconianism, 131, Pan, Vampirism, Vampires, Knowledge, Antichrist, 666, Werewolf, Therian, Wolf, 322, Therianthropy, Lycanthropy, Satanism, 9, Satan, 111, Leviathan, Occultism, Occult, 11, Magick, Transformation, White, SS, Race, Metamorphosis, 23, Evil, 28, Lifeforce, Lilith, LaVey, Elite, Illuminati, Diabolus, Lucifer, Belial, 2016, Vampirism, Zorabia, Torelia, Necronomicon, Saturn.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis Collection is a Complete Library of 621 Books in PDF format. \r\nEvery file have scanned with Kaspersky Internet Security and is totally safe.
