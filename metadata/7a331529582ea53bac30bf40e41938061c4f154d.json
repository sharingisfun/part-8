Throughout its history, keyboardist Vincent Crane was the only constant member, and wrote the majority of their material. Their history is defined by two periods, in the early 1970s and the early 1980s. Their genre in music is difficult to define, since they went through radical changes in very short times during the life of the band. However, their best-known era represented a more hard rock/progressive rock sound, exemplified by their only hit singles, &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; (UK no. 11) and &quot;The Devil's Answer&quot; (UK no. 4), both in 1971.\n\nFormer members:\nVincent Crane\nJohn Du Cann\nPaul Hammond\nCarl Palmer\nChris Farlowe\nSteve Bolton\nRic Parnell\nJohnny Mandala\nPete French\nNick Graham\nPreston Heyman\nBernie Torme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a331529582ea53bac30bf40e41938061c4f154d","amp;dn":"Atomic+Rooster+-+Discography+%281970-2002%29+%5Bmp3%40192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a331529582ea53bac30bf40e41938061c4f154d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,51,21,41,88,46,165,59,172,48,191,64,228,25,56,6,28,79,21,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
