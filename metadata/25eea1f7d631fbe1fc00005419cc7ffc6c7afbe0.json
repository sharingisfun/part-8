I am a fan of koyotesoft\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s audio converters because they are almost always free or very inexpensive, AND THEY WORK! (Often the Pro serial #s are free when one clicks on The Purchase Icon at software\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s website, AFTER you first downloading the free shareware version which is all you really need. - Note: PeerBlock Users need to Disable HTTP while Itunes is fetching song data for popular store bought discs and popular backup audio C.D. clones. ================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\n                            The Complete Story Of: \n\n\n Johnny Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Greatest Hits from American Vol. #1 to #6 [Studio Recordings from 1993 to 2003].\n\nThis Disc is not available in retail stores, as it is the simple results of a Home Studio project. Jammer Productions started out with the simple idea of doing a comparison screening of each and every song from Johnny Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Last Recordings (released so far..). The Box Set: American Volumes #1 to #6 [Recorded in 1993 to 2003] solely represents what has became known as Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Last Recordings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, which we are now up to American Vol #6 as the record company slowly releases what they have to the public thru the years since Johnny\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s death. As of press date there are 6 Volumes of Johnny Cash American, and all recorded between dates 1993 to 2003. There may still be new ones released in the future. If you like this music a lot I hope everyone that can afford the price and likes this music will buy the music within the American disc collection. (Amazon offers the set at a very fair price)\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n================================================================================\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n                            Details follow - The Voters:\n\n                            What We defined as A \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Hit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;:\n\n*In This Post Napster Music ERA, NOTHING Was Based On Purchases, Nor AirPlay!*. \n\nInstead, we decided to gather some hard core Johnny Cash Fans, to do their own voting on the best to worse songs within this Collection. One had to be a true-blue solid Cash Fan in order to vote, so the following Credentials wear placed into place for any potential J.C. Voter:\n\n#1) All Song Raters HAD to be self-described Johnny Cash Fans.\n\n#2) All Song Raters HAD to have at least purchased a single Audio CD from the collection: American - Cash \n\n#3) A Final Requirement was asked of everybody on our Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Final Song Judgment List: Any such J.C. Song Rater HAD to have watched at LEAST 1/2 of the Biographical movie \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Walk the Line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (2005) all about Johnny\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s life. Because many critics did not like the movie we decided to allow fans (to Vote) that refused to watch over half of this biography movie. -(haha, we had to do something to lower the high amount of voters that all wanted in, we simply did not have that much time)Cash is as respected now than he ever was!\n\n                         Finally - The Greatest Hit Voters -\n\nThe fans that meet all three Credentials above were limited in numbers. In a short period we had a list of six (6) people that meet the three credentials to become a Johnny Cash voter on this project. Additionally, we asked the voters to avoid listening to other music of any genre until they rated all of Volumes 1 thou 6 of Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s American songs. Nobody was compensated, as this was all done in jest and for the fun it could give many people.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n================================================================================\n________________________________________________________________________________\n         \n                                  The Results?:\n\nOne Full CD was produced with The Greatest Hits (despite no airplay often) on it. From All Six Volumes Of The American\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Cash\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Box Set. ll 458 megs of this Flac Folder is easily converted to an Audio CD with no loss in Audio quality (See program link at top for free software).
