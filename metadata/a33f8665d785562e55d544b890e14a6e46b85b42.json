It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays and arguably reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege &amp; Lief, released later the same year.\nAlthough featuring several at the time unreleased Bob Dylan songs, the album also marked Sandy Denny's maturation as a singer and songwriter, including &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot;, a song covered by many other performers and now regarded as a classic. The only traditional song on the album, &quot;A Sailor's Life&quot;, is seen as pivotal in the development of English folk rock music.\nChanges in the line-up of the band, due not only to its musical direction but also to external events, mark this album as a turning point in the band's history. 1969 was a prolific year for Fairport Convention; from What We Did on Our Holidays to Liege &amp; Lief within twelve months represented a major development.\nThe album also gave the band their first UK chart success, reaching number 12 in the UK album chart (the second highest position in the band's entire career), while the single release, &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot;, achieved number 21 in the UK singles chart.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 Genesis Hall (Thompson) 3:37\n2 Si Tu Dois Partir (Dylan) 2:21\n3 Autopsy (Denny) 4:23\n4 A Sailor's Life (Traditional) 11:11\n5 Cajun Woman (Thompson) 2:45\n6 Who Knows Where the Time Goes?
