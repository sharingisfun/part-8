This list was created in 1968 by United Artists (then owners of the A.A.P. library) and is of cartoons withheld from distribution by the current distributor. Ted Turner refused to allow any of them to be transmitted on television or released on home videotape or laser videodisc. \n(More info at http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/ltcuts11.html)\n\n\n* 1931-11-28 HittinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ the Trail to Hallelujah Land (Merrie Melodies by Hugh Harman/Rudy Ising)\n* 1936-08-08 Sunday Go to MeetinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time (Merrie Melodies supervised by Isadore Freleng) \n* 1937-05-22 Clean Pastures (Merrie Melodies supervised by I.
