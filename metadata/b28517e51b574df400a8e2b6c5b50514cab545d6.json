Watts\n\n\nTHE BOOK (1966)\nOn the Taboo \nAgainst Knowing Who You Are\n\nA BRILLIANT SYNTHESIS OF IDEAS \nTHAT USES EASTERN PHILOSOPHY AS THE KEY \nTO HELP US MAKE SENCE OF THE WAY \nWE LIVE OUR LIVES\n\nNarrator: Ralph Blum\n\n90:Min\n\nFiles:\n\nEach chapter has two audio files. One is a .wav and the other an .mp3. I am an audio engineer and like high quality recordings. I included the wavs for that reason. It's worth the time trust me. I have also included an e-book copy of &quot;The Book&quot; as well.\n\n1. Inside Information \n2. The Game Of Black-and-White\n3. How To Be A Genuine Fake\n4. The World Is Your Body\n5. So What?\n6. IT\n\n\nDescription:\n\nWhat can I say that will give this material justice? I can't even begin to appraise the value of The Book. All I ask is that you read and listen openly. Without prejudice and without any preconceptions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b28517e51b574df400a8e2b6c5b50514cab545d6","amp;dn":"Alan+Watts+The+Book+Audio%28.wav+and+.mp3%29%2FPDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b28517e51b574df400a8e2b6c5b50514cab545d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,133,23,229,27,87,77,244,0,168,226,182,197,181,5,20,202,181,69,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
