And he most definitely will not appear in Edinburgh to pay homage to a liege who has no respect for Scotland. So he does what any laird would do-he lies to the king. The last thing Ruairi expects is a beautiful English governess to appear on his doorstep.\n\n\nBut this lady spy might make him...\n\nLady Ravenna Walsingham is a seasoned spy who is sent to the savage Highlands to uncover a nefarious plot against the Crown. Playing the part of an English governess-a job easier said than done-she infiltrates the home of Laird Sutherland, a suspected conspirator. \n\n\nIf she doesn't betray him first\n\nRavenna soon discovers that the only real threat Sutherland poses is to her heart. But will the proud Highland laird ever forgive her when he discovers the woman he loves in an English spy?\n\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 353 Kb, mobi  465 Kb\nPublisher: Sourcebooks, Inc.\nISBN-13: 9781402292019\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\nNotes.
