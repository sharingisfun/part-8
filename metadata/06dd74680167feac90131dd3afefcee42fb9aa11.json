I also included some of the more familiar radio versions instead of the album cuts.  23 recurrents plus this week's Top 30 U.S. Country Singles as ranked by Mediabase makes this the largest torrent posted to date (over 3 hours of hot country music)!\n\nHere are the Top 30 Country songs for the week of May 6, 2014 with their chart positions and effective broadcast run time.
