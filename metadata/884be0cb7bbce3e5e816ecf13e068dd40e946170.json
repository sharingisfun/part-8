In August 2008 the full-length album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Syndicate of LethargyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released on Vendlus Records.\n\nExecrations second album &quot;Odes of the Occult&quot; (2011) parts with the percussive style of previous releases in favor of a wider set of influences drawing from death metal, doom and cult black metal.\nDescription\n\nOn their third full-length album, Norwegian experimental death metal band Execration take a step forward and to the left, incorporating new elements to their sound, spanning a wide set of genres, from black to heavy metal. Refining their already unique take on doomy, atmospheric death metal, and throwing in a multitude of refreshing twists and turns, Morbid Dimensions is the document of a band carving out their very own niche. Unafraid of opting for unusual and daring solutions to get exactly where they want to be, delivering death metal that draws clear influences from the old days without being &quot;retro&quot;, and that sounds fresh without ever resembling the mass-produced and soulless, modern technical death metal.\n\n\n\nReview:\n\n\nQuote:\nThese Norwegians are already the proud fathers of two previous experimental death metal releases Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœSyndicates of LethargyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœOdes of the OccultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Having missed the pleasure of both these, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMorbid DimensionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is my introduction to the group. Apparently expanding on the previous efforts with Ã¢â‚¬Å“a multitude of refreshing twists and turnsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, ExecrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s objective is to create its own niche; carrying the influence of the old school (without copying) and simultaneously avoiding/purposefully rejecting any trace of modern technical death metal. After a fair few listens to album number three, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say that the explorers from Oslo have succeeded on both counts.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœCosmic MausoleumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kicks off with primitive beats and guitars which provide some weird, unerring opening moments. Along with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contorted out of the instruments, the guitar tone adds an extra dimension of mystery and wonder by avoiding typical death metal territory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially when the terrifying heaviness kicks in. Just to confound, the music subsequently becomes almost soothing, creating quite the ambiance in the process. Next bass comes to the fore, casually strumming away until Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BANG! Blasts, nightmare inducing vocals and crushing riffs shatter everythingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Only to give way to another musical tentacle stretching session. The first concerted piece of speed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a mix of choppy riffs and punk black metal aesthetics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ necessarily makes an impact. The bottom line is that ExecrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elastic take on death metal, with its chops and changes, brings very clearly to mind the likes of Obliteration and Morbus Chron who have both lately pushed the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boundaries to the nth degree.\n\nAs an indication of the genre bending, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRitual HypnosisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shifts unflinchingly from black metal to brief Gorguts-styled oddness to abrasive groove. This is a journey into peculiarity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tortured, blasting, disorientating Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but none more so than in passages like the one in the second track where we enter a nightmarish dream sequence. Throughout, there is a somnambulistic quality to ExecrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compositions. In Ã¢â‚¬ËœMorbid DimensionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ itself, after again being subjected to the musicians doing their idiosyncratic thing and accelerated into helplessness, the track operates like some psychopath wandering around, committing heinous crimes in the veil of its sleep. Playing further on this idea of conflicted identity comes the track Ã¢â‚¬ËœDoppelgangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Reeking of unreality, the song opens with suitably vague riffs and odd, arachnid guitar lines. Rest (un)assured, Execration present the complete package both conceptually and musically when it comes to running rings around the listener.\n\nRather intuitively there is a Ã¢â‚¬ËœrespiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ offered around the midpoint. By far the most linear composition on offer, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTribulation ShacklesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hypnotises with its slow, semi-conscious crawl, and does ultimately provide some shelter from the torrent of alienation so far heaped on us. On the other hand, Ã¢â‚¬ËœVestigesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lulls the listener into a false sense of security before taking on the appearance of a predatory creature by exploding into the attack. Again, there are manifold twists and turns, inspiring a range of false perceptions. Honestly thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just too much to write about when it comes to the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s individual tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it has to be experienced to attempt to come to terms with. The only other more or less straight down the line one aside from Ã¢â‚¬ËœTribulation ShacklesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is Ã¢â‚¬ËœMiasmal SabbathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which, as its name may hint, encompasses some fairly doom-ridden influences minus the booming low-end. Painfully and persistently the guitars and vocals harass until nippy speed takes hold, with riffs at the end that are awesome.\n\nIt goes without saying that Ã¢â‚¬ËœMorbid DimensionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is an album which requires time and an open mind to approach. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the kind of disc youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pop in for background music or use as the soundtrack to a party (unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re demented). In some ways I prefer it to my experiences with the Scandinavian bands mentioned at the end of the second paragraph Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the vocals are tastefully consistent and like the music, remain clearly traceable to the death metal genre. Less existential than Morbus Chron and more seamless (to these ears at least) than Obliteration, ExecrationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approach strikes a really great balance between experimentation and extremity. The worst criticism to aim at Ã¢â‚¬ËœMorbid DimensionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is that it does sound influenced by the above acts. Hardly the end of the world though, especially when the musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this goodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nLine-up:\n\nCato - drums\nChris - guitars/vocals\nJÃƒÂ¸rgen - guitars/vocals\nJonas - bass\n\n\nExecration - Morbid Dimensions (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
