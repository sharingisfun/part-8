I fixed it.\n\nJim Jarmusch - Dead Man (1995)\n\n\nDirector:\nJim Jarmusch\n\nScreenplay:\nJim Jarmusch\n\nGenre:\nWestern\n\nPlot:\nDead Man is a 1995 film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. It stars Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, and Robert Mitchum (in his final role). The movie is something of a Modern Western, dubbed a &quot;psychedelic Western&quot; by director Jarmusch, which includes twisted elements of the Western Genre. The film is shot entirely in black-and-white.\n\nDead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named &quot;Nobody,&quot; who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.\n\nCast:\nJohnny Depp...William Blake\nGary Farmer...Nobody\nCrispin Glover...Train Fireman\nLance Henriksen...Cole Wilson\nMichael Wincott...Conway Twill\nEugene Byrd...Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett\nJohn Hurt...John Scholfield\nRobert Mitchum...John Dickinson\nIggy Pop...Salvatore 'Sally' Jenko\nGabriel Byrne...Charlie Dickinson\nJared Harris...Benmont Tench\nMili Avital...Thel Russell\nJimmie Ray Weeks...Marvin, Older Marshal\nMark Bringleson...Lee, Younger Marshal (as Mark Bringelson)\nJohn North...Mr. Olafsen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b82ee572e87ee166705182ec850b4524770d4c","amp;dn":"Jim+Jarmusch+-+Dead+Man+%281995%29+DVD+Rip+Fixed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b82ee572e87ee166705182ec850b4524770d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,184,46,229,114,232,126,225,102,112,81,130,236,133,11,69,36,119,13,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
