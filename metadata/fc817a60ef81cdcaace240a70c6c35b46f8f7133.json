Pink Floyd had become one of the biggest bands in the world, \nbut the 60s were over and the band were struggling both to find their purpose and \nthe old camaraderie\n\n59mn 26s | 689 MiB | 720x400 | 1621 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 240 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | 0.195\n\n\n\nBBC - A Pink Floyd Miscellany 1967-2005 [MP4-AAC](oan)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Rjf6j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Rjf6j.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nA compilation of rarely screened Pink Floyd videos and performances, beginning with the \nArnold Layne promo from 1967 and culminating with the reunited band's performance at \nLive 8 in 2005.
