Failinger, Elizabeth R. Schiltz and Susan J. Stabile\nAshgate Pub Co | July 2013 | ISBN-10: 140944421X | ePUB | 600 pages | 17 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Religion-Gender-Culture-Society/dp/140944421X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Religion-Gender-Culture-Society/dp/140944421X&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWith contributions from some of the most prominent voices writing on gender, law and religion today, this book illuminates some of the conflicts at the intersection of feminism, theology and law. It examines a range of themes from the viewpoint of identifiable traditions such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Buddhism, from a theoretical and practical perspective. Among the themes discussed are the cross-over between religious and secular values and assumptions in the search for a just jurisprudence for women, the application of theological insights from religious traditions to legal issues at the core of feminist work, feminist legal readings of scriptural texts on women's rights and the place that religious law has assigned to women in ecclesiastic life.Feminists of faith face challenges from many sides: patriarchal remnants in their own tradition, dismissal of their faith commitments by secular feminists, and balancing the conflicting loyalties of their lives. The book will be essential reading for legal and religious academics and students working in the area of gender and law or law and religion.\n\nAbout the Author\nMarie A.
