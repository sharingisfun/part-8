The Mormon Tabernacle Choir just keeps getting better. Now, some of the Choir&amp;#039;s most requested music has been newly recorded for Then Sings My Soul. From the glorious, soul-stirring hymn &quot;The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning&quot; to the soothing strains of &quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; and the sing-along melody of &quot;There is Sunshine in My Soul Today,&quot; each song in this collection is a time-honored favorite. Then Sings My Soul includes associated conductor Mack Wilberg&amp;#039;s magnificent new arrangements of such classics as &quot;High on the Mountain Top.&quot; &quot;How Firm a Foundation,&quot; &quot;Redeemer of Israel,&quot; and &quot;Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee.&quot; Also featured are updated versions of perennial favorites like &quot;O Divine Redeemer,&quot; &quot;The Lord&amp;#039;s Prayer,&quot; &quot;How Great Thou Art,&quot; &quot;I Know That My Redeemer Lives,&quot; and &quot;Abide with Me.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e8511a359864556b8f1db015801043eefbc60b0","amp;dn":"Mormon+Tabernacle+Choir+-+Then+Sings+My+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e8511a359864556b8f1db015801043eefbc60b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,133,17,163,89,134,69,86,184,241,219,1,88,1,4,62,239,188,96,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
