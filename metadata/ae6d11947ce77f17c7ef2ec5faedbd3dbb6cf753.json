Passarim is Jobim's major statement of the '80s, emerging during a time when his concerns were turning increasingly toward the Planet Earth. Passarim music CDs The title song is one of Jobim's most haunting creations, a cry of pain about the the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest that resonates in the memory for hours. Also, by this time, Jobim had resumed touring with a large group containing friends and family, and they carry a great deal of the load here, with lots of airy female backup vocals, two worthy songs by Jobim's multi-talented son Paulo, and another by flutist/singer Danilo Caymmi. Recorded entirely in Rio, the record's overall sound is very different from Jobim's '60s and '70s work: denser, hazier, still grounded in the samba yet rougher in texture (as is Jobim's voice). Though not as immediately winning as the Creed Taylor-produced albums, this music repays repeated listening -- particularly the extended suite from Jobim's score for the film Gabriela -- and there are samples of his wry humor in &quot;Chansong&quot; and the bossa nova reworking of &quot;Fascinatin' Rhythm&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6d11947ce77f17c7ef2ec5faedbd3dbb6cf753","amp;dn":"Tom+Jobim+-+Passarim+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6d11947ce77f17c7ef2ec5faedbd3dbb6cf753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,109,17,148,124,231,127,23,199,239,46,197,250,237,189,61,187,108,247,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
