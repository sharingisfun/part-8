Their accomplishments came in spite of several abrupt personnel changes, which were accompanied by heated, well-publicized feuds in the media and the courts. In fact, for a time, Destiny's Child were known for that drama just as much as their music. Once the group stabilized again, though, they emerged with even more hitmaking power than ever before. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.82% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalog:\t\tCK 97765\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Stand Up For Love (2005 World Children's Day Anthem)\n02.Independent Women, Pt. 1\n03.Survivor\n04.Soldier\n05.Check On It\n06.Jumpin', Jumpin'\n07.Lose My Breath\n08.Say My Name\n09.Emotion\n10.Bug A Boo\n11.Bootylicious\n12.Bills, Bills, Bills\n13.Girl\n14.No, No, No, Pt. 2\n15.Cater 2 U\n16.Feel The Same Way I Do\n17.Brown Eyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b6a20b8047b1a39a2d578eadcdd915c7022e1bf","amp;dn":"+Destiny%27s+Child+-+%23+1%27s+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b6a20b8047b1a39a2d578eadcdd915c7022e1bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,106,32,184,4,123,26,57,162,213,120,234,220,221,145,92,112,34,225,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
