What's fun and fascinating to hear on &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; are the various covers the band did of favorites from their record collection that they never performed anywhere else. It's also fun to hear the band in its early stages bristling with energy and with decent (mono) sound quality.\n\nThis remaster is different from the 1994 original release in a number of ways. These recordings have been remastered from scratch without the overuse of noise reduction, various pops and clicks removed (since many of these are drawn from a variety of sources including acetates pressed for overseas broadcast, the few original tapes that exist and, in a few cases, from amateur recordings made off of the radio back in the day when other sources didn't exist) and, in a handful of cases, improved source tapes/acetates that improve the sound. Having said all of that, these releases don't show a huge improvement in sound quality--there is only so much you can do with 50 year old mono tapes and vinyl pressings--but the sound quality improvement will be important to hardcore Beatles fans.\n\nA couple of tracks (&quot;Soldier of Love&quot; and &quot;I Forgot to Remember&quot; are the only two I could identify but there may be some others with minor tweaking) are speed corrected as well as they were running slightly too fast.\n\nThe packaging is different for this reissue compared to the original 1994 CD release. These are presesnted in a mini cardboard sleeve with each disc tucked into one portion of the packaging. The booklet occupies the third slot and it is an excellent one that provides recording details, an essay on the album and a series of excellent photos from the sessions as well.\n\nThe highlights here include &quot;That's Alright Mama&quot; (a killer cover of an Elvis classic), &quot;A Shot of Rhythm and Blues&quot;, &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, &quot;I'm a Loser&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;Honey Don't&quot; (with John on lead vocal) and &quot;Slow Down&quot;. There are, of course, many others. The talking where possible has been indexed separately. For those that wanted &quot;Lend Me Your Comb&quot; which was on the first disc of &quot;Anthology&quot;, that does show up on Volume 2 of this set as do two of the three tracks that were exclusive to the original CD single from 1994 (&quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; with only &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot; MIA on that or this set).\n\nHighly recommended for Beatles fans.\n\nIs this worth the upgrade? That really depends on how important the sound of this release is to you. If the original 1994 CD sounds perfectly fine to you, then the difference may not be that noticeable to you. I personally was unhappy with the overuse of noise reduction on the original which often made the sound of these mono recordings even more muddy. The improvement in sound is marginal by comparison to many releases but for those who disliked certain elements of the original release or who wanted improved sources for the handful of tracks here, this will be essential.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTony Hall - Live at the BBC\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Tony Hall\nAlbum................: Live at the BBC\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994 12\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 29 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
