(Try that with your DVD player.)\n\nColor corrected, light levels sometimes adjusted, background noise removed when original was too extreme.\n\nBROKEN DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL LESSONS AND DRILLS!\n\nWhy?\n\nTerry Laughlin has a brilliant swimming technique.\n\nBut watching an entire DVD in a linear fashion (or listening to one of his lectures or presentations) simply does not enable mastery of the lessons.\n\nAnd the rate he dishes out his info on video, in lecture or in presentations is always too much too fast.\n\nBecause each lesson builds on the previous, it's ineffective and pointless to roll along watching the video until you can correctly implement the principal being taught.\n\nWe have found that outside of the water, individual lessons on the iPad work great for very young swimmers, particularly with water babies -- they are great divers but lousy surface swimmers.\n\nThe basic lessons are the core and foundation of good swimming.\n\nIt helps make the water your friend.\n\nIt helps you appreciate and maximize efficiency, balance, symmetry.\n\nTechnique matters.\n\nOnce you have mastered these basic principals, then you can make your own choices about what other coaches and techniques and drills will best help you achieve your personal goals.\n\nSome competitive swimming coaches are critics of Laughlin.\n\nBut no point in doing grueling laps and distances in practice and trying to swim FAST if you have a fundamentally flawed swimming technique -- and I've seen plenty of coaches let the youngest swimmers ingrain bad habits lap after lap, day after day until the kid had little hope of ever totally breaking all the bad habits and becoming a great swimmer.\n\nThanks to everyone who kept our swimming torrents alive while we were away! We greatly appreciate it!
