Cave Story is an action-adventure game from the critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya--or Pixel to his fans. Overflowing with unmatched charm and character, Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free.\n\nYou wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The MimigasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.\n\nRun, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins of this worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!\n\nKey Features:\n- Original (320x240) graphics and upgraded Ã¢â‚¬Å“HDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ graphics\n- Remastered music as well as the original soundtrack\n- Mix-and-match new/old artwork and music!\n- Six new play modes (including Wind Fortress, Boss Rush and more!)\n- Over 20 epic boss battles through Mimiga Island\n- 15 levels to explore in the vast world\n- 10 unique weapons to find and upgrade\n- USB controller compatibility\n- Four unique endings\n- Future content updates\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMinimum:\nOS:OS X version Leopard 10.5.8, Snow Leopard 10.6.3, or later.\nProcessor:Intel only, Power PC not supported\nMemory:128 MB RAM\nGraphics:64MB RAM\n\nRecommended:\nProcessor:Intel Core Duo 2.0 Ghz and above\nMemory:512 MB RAM\nGraphics:256MB RAM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1ac1f2ccf32fa224be4cb419ca1da14c7cca15","amp;dn":"Cave+Story+%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1ac1f2ccf32fa224be4cb419ca1da14c7cca15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,26,193,242,204,243,47,162,36,190,76,180,25,202,29,161,76,124,202,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
