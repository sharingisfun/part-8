The first volume was released on Swallow Records in 1965 and helped kick-start the Cajun revival of the '60s. It's an excellent album, featuring wonderful harmonies from Rodney, Will, and Dewey, as well as stellar instrumental work. The second volume, recorded and released in 1974, isn't quite as strong as its predecessor, but it is still very good and is filled with terrific music. Both albums represent the Balfa Brothers at their peak. They may have a number of very good albums in their catalog, but The Balfa Brothers Play Traditional Cajun Music, Vols. 1-2 effectively explains what they are all about","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2ac932f30b24ad7acab4a629e37ce9eccbcd427","amp;dn":"The+Balfa+Brothers+Play+Traditional+Cajun+Music%2C+Vols.+1-2+%5B1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2ac932f30b24ad7acab4a629e37ce9eccbcd427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,172,147,47,48,178,74,215,172,171,74,98,158,55,206,158,204,188,212,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
