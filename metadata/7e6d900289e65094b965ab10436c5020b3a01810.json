And the best part is that it's so easy to make. 150 Things to Make with Roast Chicken takes a good thing and makes it even better. Instead of one, roast two chickens (or a big roaster) on Sunday night and you've got leftover makings for at least one deliciously simple weeknight meal--choose from 150 recipes for casseroles, soups, stews, stir-fries, and rice and pasta dishes, as well as a raft of chicken salads and wraps and meal-worthy salads featuring chicken. And to keep things interesting, you can put a different spin on your roast chicken for almost every week of the year, with rubs, glazes, marinades, and sauces.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ONqxQ3P.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ONqxQ3P.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e6d900289e65094b965ab10436c5020b3a01810","amp;dn":"150+Things+to+Make+with+Roast+Chicken%3A+And+50+Ways+to+Roast+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e6d900289e65094b965ab10436c5020b3a01810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,109,144,2,137,230,80,148,185,101,171,16,67,108,80,32,179,160,24,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
