Haunted by images of the attack, he vows to kill the man responsible: Luc Deveraux. While John tries to piece his reality back together, things get more complicated when he is pursued by a relentless UniSol named Magnus. Meanwhile, Deveraux and surviving UniSol Andrew Scott are preparing to battle anarchy and build a new order ruled by Unisols without government oversight. They are weeding out the weak and constantly testing their strongest warriors in brutal, life-and-death combat. Luc has emerged operating the Unisol Church of Eventualism, taking in wayward Unisols whom the government has been secretly operating as remote-controlled sleeper agents. His mission is to liberate these Unisols from the implanted memories and the lies the government has inserted in them. As John gets closer to Deveraux and the rogue army of genetically enhanced warriors, he discovers more about himself.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/4zRvrFH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/4zRvrFH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/APni9aq&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/APni9aq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/UbZYRDi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/UbZYRDi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/2PqluBg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/2PqluBg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/UjBbO9n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/UjBbO9n&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/NcGExrG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/NcGExrG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/4BWr0Ae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/4BWr0Ae&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/BbdvVFk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/BbdvVFk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/XDhXw4u&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/XDhXw4u&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\ncast\n\nean-Claude Van Damme ...

In the following shot shows Miles is bolt upright, sitting away from John and next to Dr. Colin.\n\nProduction\n\nIn May 2010 it was announced that Van Damme and Lundgren would return for a fourth official installment. Universal Soldier: A New Dimension will be the first in the series to be filmed in 3-D. John Hyams also returned as director. Hyams has cited films like Apocalypse Now, The Manchurian Candidate, Chinatown, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers among others, as inspirations for the film.\nIn April 2012, it was announced that the film's subtitle was to be re-titled from A New Dimension to Day of Reckoning.\nWhen first submitted to the MPAA, the film received an NC-17 rating due to its violence. An edited R-rated version was released in theaters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Title.....................:  Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning\n*Genre.....................:   Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 2012/English\n*Source....................: Blu-ray Remux\n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass\n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 3.22 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 3 944 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 3 606 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 448 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 818 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/2.35:1\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 53mn/01min\n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................: English,French,Danish,Bulgarian,Greek,Swedish.\n             \n\n  Menu\n\n00:00:00.000 : Chapter 01\n00:06:36.104 : Chapter 02\n00:16:42.459 : Chapter 03\n00:23:33.078 : Chapter 04\n00:29:24.012 : Chapter 05\n00:37:57.191 : Chapter 06\n00:49:45.983 : Chapter 07\n00:59:27.230 : Chapter 08\n01:08:42.451 : Chapter 09\n01:18:18.902 : Chapter 10\n01:27:51.891 : Chapter 11\n01:34:59.860 : Chapter 12 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21278ab2d02160dd988ad11563af837f892a6f89","amp;dn":"Universal+Soldier+Day+of+Reckoning+2012+1080p+BDRip+AAC+x264-tom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21278ab2d02160dd988ad11563af837f892a6f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,39,138,178,208,33,96,221,152,138,209,21,99,175,131,127,137,42,111,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
