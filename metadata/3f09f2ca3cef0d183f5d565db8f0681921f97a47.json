Analog Soul.\t\n\nNow featuring all the creative focus effects of Bokeh, ExposureÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 6 brings even more of the organic warmth and artistry of analog photography to the world of digital.\n\nBorne from more than a decade of research and input from industry-leading photographers around the globe, Exposure 6 provides you with a platform to instill your images with the subtle nuances and analog beauty of film photography. With Exposure 6, your photo will look hand-crafted, not computer-generated.\n\n- All the Creative Tools of the Film World\n\nOver the course of the last ten years, we have immersed ourselves in the rich history of analog photography in order to bring back all the creative tools of the traditional darkroom. From scientific analysis of discontinued color and B&amp;W films to detailed observation of darkroom techniques, Exposure 6 was designed to give you new ways to think about your art, realize your vision, and stand out from the crowd.\n\n- Nuances Matter\t\n\nPhotographers know more than anyone that beauty lies in the tiniest of details and Exposure 6 is built with this philosophy in mind. Within a single Exposure preset, many small effects work together to achieve a coherent look. For instance, realistic grain clumps together and is stronger in the midtones. To discover all these subtle details, our research included test shoots with films that were still available. For discontinued films we relied on photo archives and the professionals who created them. We also took time to analyze film grain under a microscope to get the characteristic look just right. As a result, Exposure renders grain accurately across the full dynamic range rather than just indiscriminately peppering the image with electronic noise like other programs do.\n\nThe technical aspects only tell one side of the story though. In building Exposure, the anthropology of learning from leading photographers who made their name shooting film was as important to us as the chemistry and math. Their thoughts on the look and feel of each film stock were woven into the presets along with the technical characteristics. The end result is that with Exposure the results feel authentic, even when the effect is not intense. Some Exposure looks are so subtle that people wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t consciously realize you altered your photo.\n\n- Develop Your Style\n\nWith over 450 presets that emulate the warmth, softness and realistic grains of film, Exposure offers a wide range of starting points for developing your look. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find accurate recreations of classic favorites like Kodachrome, TRI-X and Polaroid, plus exotic ones like Panatomic-X and GAF 500. If you discover a preset that sparks an idea, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to mold it to fit your needs. Save your new look as a preset with a name, category, and even include notes. Later, you can apply it to a photo (or batches of photos) with a single click.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/84471521178650433975.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/84471521178650433975.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/64186740267419503693.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/64186740267419503693.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f09f2ca3cef0d183f5d565db8f0681921f97a47","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Exposure+6.0.0.1134+%5BENG%5D%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f09f2ca3cef0d183f5d565db8f0681921f97a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,9,242,202,60,239,13,24,63,93,86,93,184,240,104,25,33,249,122,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
