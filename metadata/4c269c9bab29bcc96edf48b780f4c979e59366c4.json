This was a very off-beat and risque theme for the time. There is excellent development of vulnerable and sensitive characters, and a prosaic portrayal of the cult not typical of current depictions.\n\nIn contrast to my other uploads, this movie is more in the vein of psychological horror, than noir, but it is the sort of that movie noir fans are likely to enjoy anyway.\n\n*******************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c269c9bab29bcc96edf48b780f4c979e59366c4","amp;dn":"The+7th+Victim+%281943+horror%2Fnoir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c269c9bab29bcc96edf48b780f4c979e59366c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,38,156,155,171,41,188,201,110,223,72,183,128,244,201,121,229,147,102,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
