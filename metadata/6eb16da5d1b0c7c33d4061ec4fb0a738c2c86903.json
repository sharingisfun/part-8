Dressed in bizarre yet\nstylish costumes, the group offered a defiantly experimental type of rock.\n\nThey were one of the first bands to create and maintain a carefully crafted style that\nencapsulated their stage presentation, videos and record sleeves.\n\nAnd they were a significant influence on new wave music and the experimental electronic\ngroups of the early 1980s.\n\nBands such as Duran Duran, The Smiths and U2 have all admitted to being influenced by\nthem.\n\nOver the years, their popularity and reputation have remained strikingly consistent. Rolling\nStone magazine recently ranked Roxy Music in its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2056/roxy2d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img36.imageshack.us/img36/2056/roxy2d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nSmooth sounds: Bryan Ferry (2nd right) with the band pictured in 2004\n\nFerry, the son of a North-East coal miner, wrote most of the songs. But the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound was\nalso hugely influenced by co-founder Brian Eno, who went on to become one of the most\nsignificant record producers of the late 20th Century, working with bands such as Talking\nHeads, U2 and Coldplay.\n\nOther members include saxophonist Andrew Mackay, drummer Paul Thompson and guitarist\nPhil Manzanera. Below, group members provide a commentary on the tracks featured on\ntodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CD.\n\nYour track-by-track guide - in their own words:\n\nVirginia Plain\nBryan Ferry: We had just released the first Roxy Music album and our record company,\nIsland, seemed as surprised as we were by its instant success. But there was no obvious\nsingle #so they asked me if I had any other songs knocking about. I did have an unfinished\nsong called Virginia Plain, which we quickly recorded. I vividly remember our roadie driving\nup and down outside the studio as we tried to record the sound of his motorbike.\n\nDo The Strand\nBryan Ferry: I had long been a fan of Cole Porter and other songwriters from his era. Do The\nStrand was an attempt to emulate that style of writing, with a lot of cultural references that I\nfound interesting.\n\nAmazona\nPhil Manzanera: This was on the Stranded album. Brian Eno had just left the band and the\nopportunity arose for me to contribute some music for the first time. It turned out to be my first\nrecorded track on an album and I was very proud of it. When I finished recording the guitar\npart, everyone cheered in the control room.\n\nLove is the Drug\nAndy Mackay: Bryan used to work endlessly on lyrics and then deliver them as a live take in\nthe studio, like a conjurer pulling rabbits out of a hat. The most thrilling of these was Love Is\nThe Drug. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s probably been our best-selling single and the most covered.\n\nOut Of The Blue\nPhil Manzanera: This became one of our most thrilling live tracks, and we still love to play it.\nThe tape phasing used on the intro probably came from one of our producer Chris ThomasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nexperiments with The Beatles.\n\nBoth Ends Burning\nBryan Ferry: We were on a punishing world tour schedule in 1975 and there were a lot of late\nnights to get the Siren album finished on time. I guess this was the inspiration behind this\nsong.\n\nAngel Eyes\nBryan Ferry: After a short early career as an album track on our 1978 album Manifesto, Angel\nEyes was reborn as a brilliant dance re-mix, anticipating a whole new world of music. It\nbecame a big hit as a single and in clubs. It was also the first record we made a specific\npromo video for.\n\nOver You\nPhil Manzanera: In 1979, I had just built my first recording studio and I rang up Bryan and\nasked if heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to check it out. We decided to have a jam together, Bryan on bass and me\non guitar with a rhythm box. Within five minutes we had written this track and it reached\nnumber three in the charts.\n\nOh Yeah\nBryan Ferry: In this song I was trying to create a picture of Americana, and long hot summer\nevenings at drive-in movies. It is wistful and nostalgic, rather like a country record.\nMore Than This\nBryan Ferry: This is from the album Avalon, which was the breakthrough record for Roxy\nMusic in America. I started writing the songs while on the west coast of Ireland, and I like to\nthink that some of the dark melancholy of the album comes from that place.\n\nWhile My Heart Is Still Beating\nAndy Mackay: The later Roxy recordings had a particular polish and precision. Heart Still\nBeating turned out to be one of the most beautiful of the songs Bryan and I wrote together,\nthe uncertain shifting chords and sparse percussion letting his voice float as cool as glass.\n\nAvalon\nBryan Ferry: I was in a studio in New York when I heard the most haunting voice coming\ndown the corridor. It was Yanick Etienne, a singer from Haiti, who was doing a demo next\ndoor. I asked her to sing on our record, which she did in one take, and a piece of recording\nhistory was mad.\n\n\n   1.
