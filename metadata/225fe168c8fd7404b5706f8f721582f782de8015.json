This specific addition is the MLA (Modern Language Association) seventh edition, published in 2011. Odds are, anyone currently attending college, or who has done so in the past 25 years, was required to purchase a copy of this writer's guide. As an instructor of developmental writing at a local community college, this textbook is not only REQUIRED, it is that rarest of all possible things - a legitimately useful and even indispensable college textbook. Any writer of the English language, no matter what their level of development, either has or should have a copy of this guide. The reason for the unusually large size of the PDF is that I have scanned it in full color at high resolution. This is because a great deal of the content depends on multiple color markings to make its various points. I am choosing to make it available as a torrent because (at my local community college, anyway) the incompetence and malfeasance of our bookstore has made it increasingly difficult for financial aid students to get their hands on this textbook before the semester is half over. I have never felt any moral qualm about any of the myriad and diverse media that I have uploaded as a pirate, but the Bedford St. Martin's publishing company has done such an incredible job with this invaluable book (not to mention its supplemental workbooks and free online exercises), that I am quite loathe to deprive that wonderful company of even a single penny. I encourage anyone reading this to order supplemental materials and or to pay the online fee at the Bedford St. Martin website for additional access.\n\n\nFurthermore, I have uploaded the INSTRUCTORS edition, which offers additional insight into how to use and implement these materials. I realize that almost nobody reading this is likely to be an instructor of English at the collegiate level, but any homeschooling parent, advanced high school student, or someone who either is or knows a learner with ESL (English as second language) difficulties learning written English, will be able to make great use of this book. This is very probably the single most useful thing I have uploaded to the Pirate Bay in three years of torrenting. It is my hope and wish that many, many of you find this PDF to be of great use.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nA great deal of supplemental information can be found at the following website:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writersreference-seventhedition-hacker&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bedfordstmartins.com/Catalog/product/writersreference-seventhedition-hacker&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJcEAaDB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaJcEAaDB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA Writer's Reference, the most widely adopted handbook in the United States, continues to be groundbreaking in its simplicity, offering the right content in an accessible format. New coauthor Nancy Sommers's own research, campus travel, and classroom experience keep the handbook in tune with the needs of academic writers. In a trusted quick-reference format, the seventh edition delivers advice on all the right topics: working with sources, revising with comments, preparing a portfolio, and more. A Writer's Reference offers unprecedented flexibility with several versions to choose from -- a handbook that's truly at your service.\n\nA Writer's Reference\n\n\nSeventh Edition Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2011\n\nISBN-10: 0-312-60143-3\nISBN-13: 978-0-312-60143-0\nPaper Text, 576 pages\n\n\nC Composing and revising\n     C1 Planning\n     C2 Drafting \n     C3 Revising\n*new section on portfolio keeping\n     C4 Writing paragraphs\n     C5 Designing documents\n     C6 Writing with technology (*new chapter)\n    \nA Academic writing \n     A1 Writing about texts \n*new annotated advertisement\n     A2 Constructing reasonable arguments\n*new argument paper\n     A3 Evaluating arguments\n     A4 Writing in the disciplines \n    \nS Sentence style\n     S1 Parallelism\n     S2 Needed words\n     S3 Problems with modifiers\n     S4 Shifts\n     S5 Mixed constructions\n     S6 Sentence emphasis \n     S7 Sentence variety\n    \nW Word choice \n     W1 Glossary of usage\n     W2 Wordy sentences\n     W3 Active verbs\n     W4 Appropriate language\n     W5 Exact language\n     W6 The dictionary and thesaurus\n    \nG Grammatical sentences\n     G1 Subject-verb agreement\n     G2 Verb forms, tenses, and moods\n     G3 Pronouns\n     G4 Adjectives and adverbs\n     G5 Sentence fragments\n     G6 Run-on sentences\n    \nM Multilingual writers and ESL challenges\n     M1 Verbs\n     M2 Articles\n     M3 Sentence structure\n     M4 Using adjectives \n     M5 Prepositions and idiomatic expressions \n    \nP Punctuation and mechanics\n     P1 The comma\n     P2 Unnecessary commas\n     P3 The semicolon and the colon\n     P4 The apostrophe\n     P5 Quotation marks\n     P6 Other punctuation marks\n     P7 Spelling and hyphenation\n     P8 Capitalization\n     P9 Abbreviations and numbers\n     P10 Italics\n \nB Basic grammar\n     B1 Parts of speech\n     B2 Parts of sentences\n     B3 Subordinate word groups\n     B4 Sentence types   \n \nR Researching\n     R1 Conducting research\n     R2 Evaluating sources\n*new feature on scholarly vs. popular sources\n*new feature on evaluating Web sites\n     R3 Managing information; avoiding plagiarism\n*new sample annotated bibliography\n*new box on avoiding plagiarism\n     R4 Choosing a documentation style\n    \nMLA papers\n     MLA-1 Supporting a thesis\n     MLA-2 Citing sources; avoiding plagiarism\n     MLA-3 Integrating sources\n*new coverage of synthesis\n     MLA-4 Documenting sources\n*new annotated documentation models\n     MLA-5 Manuscript format; sample paper\n*new research case study\n     SAMPLE PAPER \n    \nAPA and CMS papers\n     APA-1 Supporting a thesis\n     APA-2 Citing sources; avoiding plagiarism\n     APA-3 Integrating sources\n*new coverage of synthesis\n     APA-4 Documenting sources\n*new annotated documentation models\n     APA-5 Manuscript format; sample paper\n     SAMPLE PAPER \n     CMS-1 Supporting a thesis\n     CMS-2 Citing sources; avoiding plagiarism\n     CMS-3 Integrating sources\n     CMS-4 Documenting sources\n*new Citations at a glance\n     CMS-5 Manuscript format; sample pages\n     SAMPLE PAGES\n \n*new to this edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:225fe168c8fd7404b5706f8f721582f782de8015","amp;dn":"A+Writer%5C%27s+Reference+7th+Ed.+%282011+MLA%29+Hacker+%26+Sommers+-+Inst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"225fe168c8fd7404b5706f8f721582f782de8015","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,95,225,104,200,253,116,4,181,112,111,143,114,21,130,247,130,222,128,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
