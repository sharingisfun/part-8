This book chronicles the sparkling spectacle of Jazz Age fashion as it moves from the corseted world of the 1910s to flapper dresses, fedoras and bejeweled headbands. Illustrated with period photographs, designer sketches and key excerpts from The Great Gatsby novel, the book fully captures the style and glamour of the age of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Miller. It spans the entire wardrobe of both men and women, including day and evening wear, accessories, casual attire and Ã¢â‚¬Å“fadsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ like smoking jackets, tiaras and cigarette holders.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nLaLonnie Lehman is Professor of Theatre at Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, Texas. She is a costume designer and costume historian, and is a member of the United States Institute for Technical Theatre and the Costume Society of America.
