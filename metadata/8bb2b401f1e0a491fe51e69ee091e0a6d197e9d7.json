So far I like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb2b401f1e0a491fe51e69ee091e0a6d197e9d7","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+August+11%2C+2014+%5BALL-VERSIONS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb2b401f1e0a491fe51e69ee091e0a6d197e9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,178,180,1,241,224,164,145,254,81,230,158,224,145,224,166,209,151,233,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
