Produced, like its two predecessors, by Larry Klein, this fluid and enthralling new work is Peyroux's most personal yet, hardly surprising considering she had a hand in writing each of the 11 songs, marking the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb5b902f0350b0863a8c438e2630ef0bf4cf723","amp;dn":"Madeleine+Peyroux+-++Bare+Bones+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb5b902f0350b0863a8c438e2630ef0bf4cf723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,181,185,2,240,53,11,8,99,168,196,56,226,99,14,240,191,76,247,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
