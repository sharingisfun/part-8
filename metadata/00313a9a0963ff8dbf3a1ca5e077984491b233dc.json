This expertise shows through and the result is a volume that would be a welcome addition to any mathematician's bookshelf.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½MAA Online\n\n&quot;This [book] isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦much more than just another collection of interesting, challenging problems, but is instead organized specifically for learning. The book expertly weaves together related problems, so that insights gradually become techniques, tricks slowly become methods, and methods eventually evolve into masteryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. The book is aimed at motivated high school and beginning college students and instructors. It can be used as a text for advanced problem-solving courses, for self-study, or as a resource for teachers and students training for mathematical competitions, and for teacher professional development, seminars, and workshops.\n\nI strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in creative problem-solving in mathematicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. It has already taken up a prized position in my personal library, and is bound to provide me with many hours of intellectual pleasure.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Mathematical Gazette\n\n&quot;The Olympiad book is easier to describe since the format of the Olympiad competition and the books it has spawned will be well known to most Gazette readers. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The authors have organised the material to reduce the pain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and to make the material a genuine learning experience for Olympian hopefuls and their teachers. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a valuable addition to the problem literature, and their organisational features are generally helpful rather than merely attempts to look different.&quot; (John Baylis, The Mathematical Gazette, July, 2004)\n\n\nMathematical Olympiad Challenges (Paperback)\nby Titu Andreescu (Author), Razvan Gelca (Author) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00313a9a0963ff8dbf3a1ca5e077984491b233dc","amp;dn":"Mathematical.Olympiad.Challenges.2nd.Edition.Feb.2009.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00313a9a0963ff8dbf3a1ca5e077984491b233dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,49,58,154,9,99,255,141,191,58,28,165,224,119,152,68,145,178,51,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
