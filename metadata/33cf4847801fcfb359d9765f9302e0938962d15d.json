No one can be more sensible than the compiler, of the defects of a work of this kind. In writing of a war still in progress, we cannot grasp the true proportion of its events, as we are liable to be dazzled by brilliant achievements and to attach to them a greater importance than to those which, though no less vital to the accomplishment of the object of the war, fail to attract public attention through absence of stirring victories. Such, for instance, are the operations in North Manchuria, for though the retention of positions like Haiching and Funghwangching will afterwards be found to have been as indispensable towards a successful termination of the war as the capture of Port Arthur or Wei-hai-wei, we are inore fascinated by the brillancy of the Japanese victories at those fortresses than by the stubborn resistance offered unflinchingly to inclement climate and harassing armies. While the size of this work frees it from the perplexity which would arise in a more complete history from the very multitude of newspaper reports, this same compactness exposes it to the sin of omission as regards those events, the important consequences of which we do not at present suspect. While recognising this fatal want of historical perspective, the compiler was led to produce the present work with the sole object of briefly recounting the principal events of the war, a survey of which is complicated by the operations of the Japanese armies in divers directions. The present work, therefore, makes no claim beyond facilitating this survey.\n\n\nBook Details\n\nPIBN:\t1000139177\nCategory:\tMedieval to Early Modern History - Military and War\nYear:\t1895\nLanguage:\tEnglish\nPages:\t147\nWords:\t29917\nUnique Words:\t2914  (excluding 311 stopwords)\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
