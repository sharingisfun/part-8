Based on the highly successful German version, but thoroughly revised and updated, this edition contains the latest knowledge on the mechanisms of solar energy conversion. Requiring no more than standard physics knowledge, it enables readers to understand the factors driving conversion efficiency and to apply this knowledge to their own solar cell development.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a41098524d0edac4d5be40dcaac5da959deccb2","amp;dn":"Physics+of+Solar+Cells+-+From+Principles+to+New+Concepts+-+%28Male","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a41098524d0edac4d5be40dcaac5da959deccb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,65,9,133,36,208,237,172,77,91,228,13,202,172,93,169,89,222,204,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
