He wrote his eight novellas later in his life and they show his radically original prose style, which is at the same time careful and detailed, almost bureaucratic, but also full of grotesque, ironic illusions and various sexual, political, and philosophical references.  His prose often concentrates on minute details that then serve to subvert the narrative and the narrator, and throw the whole process of narration into question.\n\nTwo English translations of Kleist's stories are represented here:\n\n* THE MARQUISE OF O &amp; OTHER STORIES (Frederick Ungar, 1973).  Translated with an Introduction by Martin Greenberg; Preface by Thomas Mann (PDF format).\n\n* THE MARQUISE OF O &amp; OTHER STORIES (Penguin, 2004).  Translated with an Introduction by David Luke and Nigel Reeves (EPUB format).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f8403f365614fb63c3d471f4028837de31560e","amp;dn":"Heinrich+von+Kleist+-+Marquise+of+O+%26amp%3B+Other+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f8403f365614fb63c3d471f4028837de31560e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,248,64,63,54,86,20,251,99,195,212,113,244,2,136,55,222,49,86,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
