Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie and Oscar Peterson\n\n\n\nThis outstanding release was recorded for Verve in 1957 plus 4 bonus tracks from a 1958 session. \nHerb Ellis is yet another unsung jazz guitarist. His sides with Oscar Peterson's legendary group added nuance and a subtle shade of soul to already perfect performances.\nEllis considers this is his favorite personal album and it is easy to see why. \nWith trumpeter Roy Eldridge and tenor saxophonist Stan Getz contributing contrasting but equally rewarding solos and lots of inspired riffing while bassist Ray Brown and drummer Stan Levey join Ellis in the pianoless rhythm section, these performances have plenty of color and drive. \nEllis does indeed stick to the blues during the original eight selections yet there is also a surprising amount of variety. \nThis CD reissue has been augmented by four numbers from 1958 originally recorded for a French movie soundtrack, and feature power pairings of Dizzy Gillespie and Roy Eldridge on trumpet, Coleman Hawkins and Stan Getz on tenor sax and a dynamite rhythm section comprised of Oscar Peterson on piano, Ellis on guitar, Ray Brown on bass and Gus Johnson on drums.\nThis album should be in every jazz collection. A selection of great blues standards and originals.\n\n\n\nCD / 1994 / Remastered / Bonus Tracks / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n1  Pap's Blues \t \n2  Big Red's Boogie Woogie \t \n3  Tin Roof Blues  \t \n4  Soft Winds \t \n5  Royal Garden Blues  \t \n6  Patti Cake  \t \n7  Blues For Janet  \t \n8  Blues For Junior  \t \n9  Les Tricheurs * \t \n10 Clo's Blues * \t \n11 Phil's Tune * \t \n12 Mic's Jump *\t\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Herb Ellis\nSaxophone - Stan Getz\nTrumpet - Roy Eldridge   \nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ray Brown \nDrums - Stan Levey (tracks: 1 to 8) \nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gus Johnson (tracks: 9 to 12)\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Oscar Peterson (tracks: 9 to 12) \nSaxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Coleman Hawkins (tracks 9 to 12)\nTrumpet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dizzy Gillespie (tracks 9 to 12)\n\n\n\n\nTracks 1-8 recorded October 11 &amp; 12, 1957 in Hollywood, CA\nOriginal LP issue: Nothing But The Blues Verve MGV 8252\n\nTracks 9-12 recorded May 1, 1958 in Paris are bonus tracks that did not appear on the original LP\nOriginal 45-rpm EP issue: Les Tricheurs Barclay (F) 74 024\n\n\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28e3f738599cb6861e010c08e0e61b183bd21a48","amp;dn":"Herb+Ellis+-+Nothing+But+The+Blues++%2F+1958","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28e3f738599cb6861e010c08e0e61b183bd21a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,227,247,56,89,156,182,134,30,1,12,8,224,230,27,24,59,210,26,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
