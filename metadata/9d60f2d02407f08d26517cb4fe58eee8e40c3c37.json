Hughes scrolls through Barcelona's often violent history; tells the stories of its kings, poets, magnates, and revolutionaries; and ushers readers through municipal landmarks that range from Antoni Gaudi's sublimely surreal cathedral to a postmodern restaurant with a glass-walled urinal. The result is a work filled with the attributes of Barcelona itself: proportion, humor, and seny -- the Catalan word for triumphant common sense.\nGenre: History","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d60f2d02407f08d26517cb4fe58eee8e40c3c37","amp;dn":"Barcelona+the+Great+Enchantress+-+Robert+Hughes.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d60f2d02407f08d26517cb4fe58eee8e40c3c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,96,242,208,36,7,240,141,38,81,124,180,254,88,238,232,228,12,60,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
