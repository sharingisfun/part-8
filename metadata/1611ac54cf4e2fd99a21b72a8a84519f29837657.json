Isolated for hundreds of thousands of years, pockets of individuals survive, thrive and adapt to fill all available niches fuelling a rapid development of new species. In the new series of Wildest, viewers will be taken to the Islands Islands of Mystery in the Philippines, a nation of over 7,000 islands forming one of the most ancient archipelagos in the world and will explore Japan's expansive 6,852 islands. Other islands include the breath taking Rivers of Life in Vancouver and the islands around the Amazon River in Brazil.\n\n\n1)  Japan: Islands of Extremes \nExplore the unique array of Asian and Arctic species that inhabit Japan, an expansive chain of 6,852 islands stretching over 2,400 kilometers and covering a range of wildly diverse climatic zones including snow-covered mountains and steamy mangroves. This is home to wildlife not found anywhere else on Earth. In bleak, inhospitable conditions in Honshu, snow monkeys or Japanese macaques endure the bitter cold of Hell's Valley by basking in warm volcanic pools. The secretive Japanese Serow, one of the most distinctive animals celebrated in ancient stories, comes out of hiding to forage. This peaceful and mythical creature is said to have the legs of a goat, body of a deer and fur of a wolf.\n\n2) ******* Amazon River Islands ********\nLearn about the amazing creatures that inhabit the thousands of isolated jungle islands spread along the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, the world's largest freshwater archipelago. Stranded on the mighty Rio Negro, these islands are engulfed by seasonal floods changing their landscapes completely, so everything here is forced to adapt or die. At the heart lie the Anavilhanas and Mariua archipelagos surrounded by flooded forests and hidden dangers. Fish feed from the treetops and canopy dwellers like the three-toed sloth stalked by creatures that lurk beneath. Only two primates live here - red howler monkeys and squirrel monkeys. They live among hunters like black caimans, piranhas and green anacondas. Over 200 species of birds live on the islands of Anavilhanas archipelago; some are busy in search of food, others in search of love. One bird that goes to great extremes to find a mate is the wire-tailed Manakin. The males participate in an incredible dance-off in an attempt to win the female's affections.\n\n3)  Vancouver: Island Rivers of Life \nOver in British Columbia, Canada lies Vancouver Island, a vast and wild island with a backbone of jagged mountains running its length. The largest island off the west coast of North America, its glaciers fuel the flow of some of Canada's tallest waterfalls and an endless network of rivers and creeks make it the ideal habitat for the Pacific salmon. Turkey vultures gather for the migration south as they head for warmer weather in winter.\n\n4)  Philippines: Islands of Mystery \nThe Philippine archipelago is made up of over 7,000 tropical islands and is a breeding ground for many rare animals. On the stunning island of Palawan, where craggy limestone cliffs poke out from the dense jungle, giant bugs roam the land. Predators line the edge of the forests, while rivers help carve one of the world's most extensive cave systems, a subterranean cavernous world crowded with bats, whip scorpions, tarantulas, and other insects. This is the home of the mysterious bearcat, an animal that looks like a cross between a bear and a cat though related to neither and is as agile in the trees as a monkey.Palawans prehistoric coastline is the hunting ground of marauding giant lizards which will indiscriminately devour anything they can catch. On the island of Bohol, gangs of macaques with a taste for the unusual ghost crabs raid the swamp-like mangroves. Behold an awe-inspiring phenomenon found rarely in nature: an incredible lightshow of green bioluminescence created as hundreds of thousands of synchronous fireflies gather at dusk to light up the forest. As darkness descends, the tarsier, one of the Philippines' most enigmatic creatures, comes out to hunt.\n\n5)  Falkland Islands: Penguin Paradise \nIts bleak, battered, and windswept archipelago lies 460 kilometres from the South American mainland. Rugged mountains and an expansive pristine coastline make The Falklands an unspoiled destination for wildlife, notably for one of the world's most iconic flightless birds, the beloved penguin. The Falklands' sandy beaches and rolling meadows combine to make it one of the world's premiere penguin sanctuaries. Over a million breed on the islands each summer. Pandemonium breaks out in a rockhopper penguin colony, sea lions ambush gentoo penguins in the surf, Skuar scavenge carcasses of Megellanic penguins that have washed ashore, and black-browed albatrosses perform their romantic courtship rituals.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5997/21c7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/5997/21c7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6863/7q5j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6863/7q5j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/9990/69t8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/9990/69t8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5473/m1nm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/5473/m1nm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/299/i5ub.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/299/i5ub.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/8180/zzlt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/8180/zzlt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/8660/mbkh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/8660/mbkh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/6357/k9kc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/6357/k9kc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/6496/zw14.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/6496/zw14.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9711/86c9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9711/86c9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/4959/irk3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/4959/irk3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5053/64cf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5053/64cf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;622a0b050a222e564c52&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2004 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 662 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1611ac54cf4e2fd99a21b72a8a84519f29837657","amp;dn":"Wildest+Islands+Series+2+2of5+Amazon+River+Islands+540p+PDTV+x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1611ac54cf4e2fd99a21b72a8a84519f29837657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,17,172,84,207,78,47,217,154,33,183,42,138,132,81,159,41,131,118,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
