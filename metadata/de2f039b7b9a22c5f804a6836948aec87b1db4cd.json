Sheâ€™s also desperate. Due to her classified knowledge of alternative worlds, sheâ€™s being blackmailed into working as a spy â€“ and her fatherâ€™s life is at stake. But Katyaâ€™s assignment seems impossible. \r\nShe must hunt down a mysterious artifact that could give the dying Tzar his dearest wish â€“ new life. But itâ€™s hidden on an alternate Earth, on an American controlled island. Sheâ€™ll have to go deep undercover to gain access to this prize. And Borodin, the Tzarâ€™s ruthless spymaster, has his own reasons for needing the object. \r\nHowever, ambition blinds these men to the facts. The artifact will call down terror from the depths of space. If they use it, the Russian Empire, the Americansâ€™ beleaguered territories and all linked versions of earth face extinction. Katya discovers the truth with Jerry, an American survivalist based on the island. Together they must stop the artifact being activated, at any costs. Two civilizations depend upon it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2f039b7b9a22c5f804a6836948aec87b1db4cd","amp;dn":"Survival+Game+-+Gary+Gibson+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2f039b7b9a22c5f804a6836948aec87b1db4cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,47,3,155,123,154,34,197,248,4,166,131,105,72,174,200,123,29,180,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
