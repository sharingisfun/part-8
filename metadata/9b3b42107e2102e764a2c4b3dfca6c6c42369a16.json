Unlike his debut, 1994's Word...Life, Jewelz features a wider number of guest producers and rappers. Legendary producer DJ Premier (who also oversaw and mixed other parts of the album) lends his hand on four songs, while Buckwild, Da Beatminerz and O.Gee all drop 3 songs each. D.I.T.C. members Showbiz and Lord Finesse each contribute one number each and as the album was released the production was highly praised for its clean, crispy but at the same time dark and menacing sound.\n\nO.C. plays with a wide array of styles on the album; from the war-metaphor battle song &quot;War Games&quot; to abstract stories on the haunting &quot;The Crow&quot; and a very special history on a mystique woman that enters Credles life in &quot;Stronjay&quot;. Though the differences between O.C.'s two first efforts are very noticeable many fans are constantly, and still, arguing which was the better album out of them.\n\nThis album, like his first, received strong reviews, but lacked in sales. He made his first appearance on the Billboard 200 album chart with the album, and also, his first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, with the single &quot;Far From Yours&quot;.\n\nAs part of the concept for Jewelz, the CD was sold with different colored disc art inspired by the color palate of various jewels.\n\nTrack listing\n#\tTitle\tSongwriters\tProducer(s)\tPerformer (s)\n1\t&quot;Intro&quot;\t\t\t*Interlude*\n2\t&quot;My World&quot;\tO.
