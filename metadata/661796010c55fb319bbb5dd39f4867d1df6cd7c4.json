Other characteristics are a call and response between the soloist and the chorus, and an especially tense vocal sound. The genre also occasionally uses improvisational additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds. \n\n\n\n\nSoul Hits of the 80s \n\n\n\n\nFrom\n\n\nA budget three-CD set, Soul Hits of the 80's collects some of that awkward decade's soul moments from the Columbia/Sony catalog. Note the author's use of &quot;moments&quot; and the title's use of &quot;hits,&quot; because they are, in fact, talking about the same songs. Not everything here was a hit, with some of the songs just squeaking into the Billboard Top 100; however, regardless of chart position, they do represent the era very well. There's a broad range of work here, from jazz crossovers like Stanley Jordan with &quot;Heaven Sent You&quot; and Grover Washington with &quot;Summer Nights&quot; to straight pop crossovers like Deniece Williams with &quot;Let's Hear It for the Boy&quot; and the classic and true hit &quot;Easy Lover&quot; by Philip Bailey and Phil Collins. Other actual chart-toppers here include &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot; by Mtume, Herbie Hancock with the seismic hit &quot;Rockit,&quot; and one-hit wonder Johnny Kemp with &quot;Just Got Paid.&quot; Luther Vandross, Teena Marie, Bill Withers, Babyface, and Regina Belle are a few of the others whose tracks pepper this 40-song (!) collection. It's not definitive, but does a fine job of representing just how broad soul music's reach had become in the '80s. ~ Wade Kergan\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\nJuicy Fruit - James Mtume\nSanctified Lady - Marvin Gaye\nBaby Come To Me - Regina Bell\nStop To Love - Luther Vandross\nLet's Hear It For The Boy - Deniece Williams\nCaravan Of Love - Isley Jasper Isley\nAll Cried Out - Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam\nLovergirl - Teena Marie\nShining Star - Manhattans\nFall In Love With Me - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\nShake You Down - Gregory Abbott\nLovey Dovey - Tony Terry\nEasy Lover - Phil Collins &amp; Phillip Bailey\n\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\nEncore - Cheryl Lynn\nOoo La La La - Teena Marie\nShower Me With Your Love - Surface\nLost in Emotion - Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam\nMagnetic - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\nAll In My Mind - Full Force\nHow 'Bout Us - Champaign\nHeaven Sent You - Stanley Clarke\nHere and Now - Luther Vandross\nYou, Me and He - Mtume\nDancing in The Sheets - Shalamar\nThigh Ride - Tawatha Agee\nAll I Want Is Forever - James Taylor, J.T, Regina Belle\n\n\n Disc 3 \n\n\nRockit - Herbie Hancock\nSummer Nights - Grover Washington Jr.\nWishing Well - Terence Trent Darby\nOh Yeah! - Bill Withers\nSave The Overtime (For Me) - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips\nSweat (Till You Get Wet) - Brick\nHydraulic Pump - P Funk All Stars\nLove Attack - Issac Hayes\nIt's Gonna Be A Miracle - Deneice Williams\nShow Me The Way - Regina Belle\nNights (Feel Like Getting Down) - Billy Ocean\nJust Got Paid - Johnny Kemp\nFake - Alexander O'Neal\nIts No Crime - Babyface\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661796010c55fb319bbb5dd39f4867d1df6cd7c4","amp;dn":"Soul+Hits+of+the+80s+-+Various+Artists+2004+%283+CD%29+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661796010c55fb319bbb5dd39f4867d1df6cd7c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,23,150,1,12,85,251,49,155,187,93,211,159,72,103,209,223,108,215,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
