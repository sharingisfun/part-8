He could claim major responsibility for the folk music revival of the late '50s and early Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s; he wrote a handful of songs, including &quot;If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song),&quot; &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone,&quot; and &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season),&quot; that became major hits; he single-handedly popularized the five-string banjo and literally taught a generation to play it, as well as other musical instruments through a series of instructional books and records; he played thousands of concerts in every conceivable venue, at which he demonstrated an unparalleled ability to get his audiences singing with him; and he recorded dozens of albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ec36cdaf802bc6c2e92dcc027af0aa06b27f1d","amp;dn":"Pete+Seeger+-+We+Shall+Overcome+%28Live%29+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ec36cdaf802bc6c2e92dcc027af0aa06b27f1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,236,54,205,175,128,43,198,194,233,45,204,2,122,240,170,6,178,127,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
