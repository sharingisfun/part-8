Truman commissioned a top-secret residential development in a remote area of the Pacific Northwest, one that would serve to protect and nurture America's most valuable intellectual resources. There our nation's greatest thinkers, the ÃƒÂ¼ber-geniuses working on the next era of scientific achievement, would be able to live and work in a supportive environment. The best architects and planners were commissioned to design a welcoming place for these superlative geniuses to reside, an area that would offer the best education for their children, the best healthcare, the best amenities and quality of life. A community was created to rival the most idyllic of America's small towns - with one major difference: this town would never appear on any maps. At least, none that haven't been classified &quot;eyes only&quot; by the Pentagon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:106c53a2404a56f143d0b5c15c698c16e36f3bfb","amp;dn":"Eureka+Complete+Series+%28XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"106c53a2404a56f143d0b5c15c698c16e36f3bfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,108,83,162,64,74,86,241,67,208,181,193,92,105,140,22,227,111,59,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
