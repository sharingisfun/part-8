But three things have changed the path to success:\n\nBoomers are realizing that a lot of the things they were promised arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to materialize, and they have started second and third careers.\n\nTechnology has given access to an unprecedented number of people who are building online empires and changing their lives in ways that would have been impossible years ago.\n\nThe days of Ã¢â‚¬Å“success first, significance later,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have ended.\n\nWhile none of the stages can be skipped, they can be shortened and accelerated. There are only two paths in life: average and awesome. The average path is easy because all you have to do is nothing. The awesome path is more challenging, because things like fear only bother you when you do work that matters. The good news is Start gives readers practical, actionable insights to be more awesome, more often.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7ef8e89c2560c0eb43a5cf29f1a83ab8c03956","amp;dn":"Start%3A+Punch+Fear+in+the+Face%2C+Escape+Average+and+Do+Work","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7ef8e89c2560c0eb43a5cf29f1a83ab8c03956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,126,248,232,156,37,96,192,235,67,165,207,41,241,168,58,184,192,57,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
