It was released for Microsoft's Windows-based personal computers in 2000. The game's story focuses on a group of young mercenaries who are drawn into an international conflict, and seek to protect the world from a sorceress manipulating the war for her own purposes.\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII is a departure from many traditional standards of the Final Fantasy series. It is the first game in the series to consistently use realistically proportioned characters, the first to feature a vocal piece as its theme music, and one of the only titles to deviate from the series' traditional means of increasing a character's power. In addition, it does not have a magic point-based system for spellcasting.\n\nThe game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful. It was voted the 22nd best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu. 13 weeks after its release, Final Fantasy VIII had earned more than US$50 million in sales, making it the fastest-selling Final Fantasy title. The game has sold 8.15 million copies worldwide as of March 31, 2003.\n\nDeveloper(s)\n\nSquare\n\nPublisher(s)\n\nJP Square\nNA Square Electronic Arts\nPAL SCE Europe (PlayStation)\nEU Eidos Interactive (Windows)\n\n\nDesigner(s)\n\nYoshinori Kitase\n\n\nWriter(s)\n\nKazushige Nojima\n\n\nArtist(s)\n\nTetsuya Nomura\nYusuke Naora\n\n\nComposer(s)\n\nNobuo Uematsu\n\n\nSeries\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\n\nPlatform(s)\n\nPlayStation,\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n\nRelease date(s)\n\nPlayStation\nJP February 11, 1999\nNA September 9, 1999\nPAL October 27, 1999\n\nWindows\nNA January 25, 2000\nEU February 18, 2000\nJP March 23, 2000\n\n\nGenre(s)\n\nConsole role-playing game\n\n\nMode(s)\n\nSingle-player\n\n\nRating(s)\n\nCERO: B (12+)\nELSPA: 11+\nESRB: T (Teen)\nOFLC: M15+\nUSK: 12+\n\n\nMedia\n\n4 CD-ROMs (PlayStation)\n5 CD-ROMs (Windows)\n\n\nIdeal to play on PC using emulator (possible using files directly for HD).
