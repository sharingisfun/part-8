The album features the signature pathos of his earlier workÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½screaming saxophones, a rocking and unpredictable rhythm section, and explosions of harsh dissonance followed by intensely emotional interludes that recall the great Romantic composers. An absolutely essential addition to any music-loverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s library, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is a true and unparalleled benchmark of jazz composition and improvisation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=catalogdetail&amp;valbum_code=HD00011105017428&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.hdtracks.com/index.php?file=catalogdetail&amp;valbum_code=HD00011105017428&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7f106842d40b6b1a1b22f52bf9f41fbaa8406c","amp;dn":"Mingus%3A+The+Black+Saint+and+the+Sinner+Lady+1963+%5B24%2F96+HDtracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7f106842d40b6b1a1b22f52bf9f41fbaa8406c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,127,16,104,66,212,11,107,26,27,34,245,43,249,244,31,186,168,64,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
