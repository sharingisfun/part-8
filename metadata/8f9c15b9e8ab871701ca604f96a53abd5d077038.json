Three men stand on one side: Cary (Jason Patrick), a womanizing doctor who rehearses make-out lines and keeps his body almost grotesquely ripped; Jerry (Ben Stiller), a self-obsessed theater instructor who chews over every emotion like a morsel of dessert; and Barry (Aaron Eckhart), a man grown soft in his marriage to a woman who can't satisfy him sexually as well as he can himself. On the other side we have three equally well-defined women: Terri (Catherine Keener), a writer/editor whose prefers to keep words out of the bedroom, much to the chagrin of live-in beau Jerry; Mary (Amy Brenneman), a freelance writer whose attempts to find her own sexual fulfillment with both husband Barry and paramour Jerry meet with a similar lack of success; and Cheri (Nastassja Kinski), an art assistant who meets most of the other characters one by one at a gallery but directs her sylph-like affections in an unexpected direction. The lies, double-crosses, and confrontations between these characters resolve into a sinisterly comic indictment of the very idea of romantic fulfillment. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119517/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119517/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-19718&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-19718&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:36:01\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 672x272 2.47:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1725 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,39 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 5\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 448 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f9c15b9e8ab871701ca604f96a53abd5d077038","amp;dn":"Your+Friends+%26+Neighbors+%281998%29++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f9c15b9e8ab871701ca604f96a53abd5d077038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,156,21,185,232,171,135,23,1,202,96,79,150,165,58,189,93,7,112,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
