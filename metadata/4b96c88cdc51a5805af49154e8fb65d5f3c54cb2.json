Singalong masterpieces &quot;(All I Have to Do Is) Dream&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; have passed into the cultural consciousness, still widely played and enjoyed. Decades after they had last recorded together, Don and Phil reunited at Royal Albert Hall in September 1983 and resurrected some of their sparkling chemistry. &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; are present only on some versions of the albums documenting this historic concert, while such favorites as &quot;Walk Right Back,&quot; &quot;Love Is Strange,&quot; and &quot;When Will I Be Loved?&quot; not only roll out the carpet of nostalgia but actually sound fresh and catchy to contemporary ears. The Brothers are backed by a full-sized band that rocks harder than any of the duo's '50s ensembles did, without diluting the pair's tender, sensitive harmonies. The Reunion Concert gives listeners yet one more taste of the Everlys' legendary pop magic.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Love Ballads\n\n[01] The Price Of Love\n[02] Walk Right Back\n[03] Claudette\n[04] Crying In The Rain\n[05] Love Is Strange\n[06] Medley (Take A) Message To Mary -  Maybe Tomorrow - I Wonder If I Care As Much\n[07] When Will I Be Loved\n[08] Bird Dog\n[09] Medley - Devoted To You - Ebony Eyes - Love Hurts\n[10] For The Love Of Barbara Allen\n[11] Lightning Express\n[12] Put My Little Shoes Away\n[13] Long Time Gone\n[14] Down In The Willow Garden\n[15] Step It Up And Go\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:52m:03s\n\nCD02 Track Listings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rock Ballads\n\n[01] Cathy's Clown\n[02] Gone, Gone, Gone\n[03] You Send Me\n[04] So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)\n[05] Baby What You Want Me To Do\n[06] Bye Bye Love\n[07] All I Have To Do Is Dream\n[08] Wake Up Little Susie\n[09] ('Til) I Kissed You\n[10] Temptation\n[11] Be-Bop-A-Lula\n[12] Lucille\n[13] Let It Be Me\n[14] Good Golly Miss Molly\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:51m:05s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 535mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
