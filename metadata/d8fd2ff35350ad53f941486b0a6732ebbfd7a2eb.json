No-one seemed very interested when I posted I'm Not Rappoport, maybe this will be more enticing.\n\nThis movie was remade by Al Pacino as Scent of a Woman (1992), but cognoscenti reckon the original is better - check and compare. The story is a comedy about a blind retired military officer who has a lusty taste for the ladies, whom he distinguishes by their scent. After many madcap adventures, he experiences true fear when he genuinely falls in love.\n\nI copped the movie from youtube and the subtitles from opensubtitles, I had a devil of a job to make them fit; they should work fairly well now. The movie is Spanish-dubbed, the subtitles are in English.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8fd2ff35350ad53f941486b0a6732ebbfd7a2eb","amp;dn":"Profumo+di+Donna+%281974%29+Scent+of+a+Woman+Eng+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8fd2ff35350ad53f941486b0a6732ebbfd7a2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,253,47,243,83,80,173,83,249,65,72,107,10,103,50,235,191,215,162,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
