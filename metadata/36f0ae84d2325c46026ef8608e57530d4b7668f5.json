The shape, the speed, and the mood of each ride is determined by the song you choose.\nYou earn points for clustering together blocks of the same color on the highway, and compete with others on the internet for the high score on your favorite songs.\n\n&quot;A near-religious musical gaming experience&quot; --Alec Meer, PC Gamer UK\n&quot;Absolutely brilliant on every level&quot; --Independent Games Festival Judge\n&quot;The logical extension of all music games&quot; --Joe Martin, bit-tech.net\n&quot;Technically and conceptually a tour de force&quot; --Kieron Gillon, Eurogamer\n&quot;The best possible excuse to rediscover your Cd/MP3 collection&quot; --Scott Sharkey, 1UP\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAudiosurf needs an Intel Chip. Core2Duo Recommended (the GMA950 can run it)\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f0ae84d2325c46026ef8608e57530d4b7668f5","amp;dn":"Audiosurf+Mac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f0ae84d2325c46026ef8608e57530d4b7668f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,240,174,132,210,50,92,70,2,110,248,96,142,87,83,13,75,118,104,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
