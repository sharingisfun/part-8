When Capone is sent back to the neighborhood where he grew up, he makes the shocking discovery that his best friend from childhood, Ratty (Mark Danvers), has taken up a life of crime as a right-hand man for local crime boss Oney (Carl Bradshaw). Capone learns that Ratty is a key man in Oney's gun-running operation, and he's torn between his loyalty to his friend and his duties as a cop; Rita (Audrey Reid), Capone's ex-girlfriend who now lives with Ratty, is caught in the middle. Shot in Jamaica using a mixture of professional actors and folks off the street, Third World Cop is scored with a pulsating reggae soundtrack, featuring Sly and Robbie, Beenie Man, the Marley Brothers, Innocent Crew, and Wally Badarou. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide less","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab24ff81e8d3f8de215add23e84f9163f55a3bc7","amp;dn":"Third+World+Cop+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab24ff81e8d3f8de215add23e84f9163f55a3bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,36,255,129,232,211,248,222,33,90,221,35,232,79,145,99,245,90,59,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
