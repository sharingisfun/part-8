In this final DVD of his series on the endgame, our endgame specialist introduces you to the most important of these rules of thumb. The first part deals with general guidelines such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“activate the kingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the rook belongs behind passed pawnsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“do not rushÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. In addition to such principles which are specific to the endgame, there are also rules of thumb as to making the correct exchanges, prophylaxis, improving the position of the worst placed piece, which you should already be taking into account in the middlegame! The second part is sorted by material, going from pawn endings to endings with rook and minor piece against rook and minor piece. Once again Karsten MÃƒÂ¼ller will hone your sixth sense for discovering when there are exceptions to the rules. Because only this ability, which goes beyond the mere learning by heart of the rules of thumb, is the sign of real mastery. This DVD forms the final part of Karsten MÃƒÂ¼llerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s series on the endgame, which already belongs to the classics of endgame theory. It is a must for the fans of the grandmaster from Hamburg!\n\nVideo running time: 7 hours 27 min (English) 67 Video clips.
