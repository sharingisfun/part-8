Handle a wide range of audio production tasks efficiently, \nincluding recording, mixing, and sound restoration.\n\nHow to Extract           : Install, launch 'AuditionPortable.exe'.\n\nNotes                    :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ I use a 64-bit Operating System, thus i tested for 'Stealthiness' on XP, \nVista, Win7, and 32/64! Most people don't realize different Operating Systems\nmay leave trash at different locations &amp; names.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ If you're into audiophile/flac/lossless quality audio like me, then you know\nverification is very important. A very important tool that helps is Audition's\n'Spectral Analysis'. I like it over others because of it's accuracy, features,\noptions, and the professional output. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Of course.. Audition is more than a 'Spectral Analysis'.. it's a professional\naudio/video production suite.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ I posted a portable NSIS version a while ago but i highly recommend you\nupgrade to this. PortableApps.com Format (PAF) is faster, lighter, cleaner, \nand follows a strict specification.
