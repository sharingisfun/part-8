Though IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m considered a contemporary music composer, if I dare categorize myself as an artist, I've been strongly influenced by the Lydian Concept, which is not simply a musical method ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ we might call it a philosophy of music, or we might call it poetry.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Toru Takemitsu, Swing Journal interview, Tokyo\n\n\nThe simple melody was an experiment inspired by an evening Miles had spent with George Russell who at the time was working on his Lydian Chromatic Concept, Miles was fascinated by RussellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach.

Shortly after his evening with Russell, Miles recorded his new composition demonstrating RussellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basic principles.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Round About Midnight: A Portrait of Miles Davis by Eric Nisenson, Dial Press, New York","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c8c2d3997449084070afe0c1743aa51ac92a6a","amp;dn":"George+Russell+-+Lydian+Chromatic+Concept+of+Tonal+Organization.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c8c2d3997449084070afe0c1743aa51ac92a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,200,194,211,153,116,73,8,64,112,175,224,193,116,58,165,26,201,42,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
