To point out a few, there is Jesus Culture, Jars of Clay, PlanetShakers, and Peter Furler.  There is Hillsong, Donnie McClurkin, James Fortune And FIYA (thanks bdurden11), and Memphis May Fire.  There is Sleeping At Last, Future Of Forestry, The Royal Royal, and even a couple of singles from the newly formed PawnShop Kings that you've got to make sure you take a moment to check out.\n\nThat being said, I hope there's a little something for everyone in today's bundle.  It is my continued prayer that one of these songs, perhaps even a mere lyric within, draws you nearer to the Father.\n\nREGGAE: Addis Pablo.  SINGER-SONGWRITER: Brothers, Worship Outreach.
