The recording features Pete Townshend together with a full band and actors performing in this theatrical presentation.\n\nThe &quot;Psychoderelict&quot; tour was one of the most enjoyable of Pete's solo tours. It featured great performances of Pete's solo music as well a a nice spin on some classic Who songs, including, &quot;A Quick One While He's Away&quot; and &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot;! Unfortunately, for this show, (which was professional recorded for Pay-Per-View and video) Pete stayed up all night and did a full dress rehearsal before the show, causing him to lose a good portion of his voice. Hopefully, some other shows from this great tour will be released to better represent how Pete actually performed...\n\nNote: The track listing is not in performance order and the non Pete-written songs performed that night (i.e. &quot;Good Night Irene&quot;, &quot;Save It for Later&quot;, etc.) which were shown on the Pay-Per-View, were deleted to fit the rest of the songs on 2 CDs.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01.
