At twenty-nine, socialite Allie Nelson is about to marry a wealthy lawyer, but she cannot stop thinking about the boy who long ago stole her heart. Thus begins the story of a love so enduring and deep it can turn tragedy into triumph, and may even have the power to create a miracle\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nNicholas Charles Sparks is an American novelist, screenwriter and producer. He has published seventeen novels and a non-fiction book.
