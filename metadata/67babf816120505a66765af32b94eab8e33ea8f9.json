DJ Nu-Mark, of Jurassic 5 fame, has crafted a mellow, smooth mix CD that successfully merges mid-&amp;#039;90s backpacker rap with its successor, the indie underground, and also offers an ambitious selection of foreign MCs the opportunity to snag some well-needed shine time. Nu-Mark sparks it off with a nice selection of slow funk burners before streaming into a run of artfully chopped up classics, highlights of which are an alternate version of Organized Konfusion&amp;#039;s &quot;Fudge Pudge&quot; and a groovy Latin instrumental by the Beatnuts. Surprisingly, the underground rap that follows sounds pretty ho-hum in comparison. But Hands On regains momentum when ShurikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢n, of the French group IAM, kicks off the international section of the disc. Nu-Mark and J-Live take it back Stateside and end things on a perfect note with a brand new tune entitled &quot;Brand Nu Live.&quot; --Rebecca Levine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67babf816120505a66765af32b94eab8e33ea8f9","amp;dn":"DJ+Numark+-+Hands+On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67babf816120505a66765af32b94eab8e33ea8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,186,191,129,97,32,80,90,102,118,90,243,43,148,234,184,227,62,168,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
