Thugs became celebrities, responsible authority was rendered impotent. Social mores in place for a century were obliterated. Especially among the young, and most especially among young women, liquor consumption rocketed, propelling the rest of the culture with it: skirts shortened. Music heated up. America's Sweetheart morphed into The Vamp.\n\nProhibition turned law-abiding citizens into criminals, made a mockery of the justice system, caused illicit drinking to seem glamorous and fun, encouraged neighborhood gangs to become national crime syndicates, permitted government officials to bend and sometimes even break the law, and fostered cynicism and hypocrisy that corroded the social contract all across the country. With Prohibition in place, but ineffectively enforced, one observer noted, America had hardly freed itself from the scourge of alcohol abuse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ instead, the &quot;drys&quot; had their law, while the &quot;wets&quot; had their liquor.\n\nThe story of Prohibition's rise and fall is a compelling saga that goes far beyond the oft-told tales of gangsters, rum runners, flappers, and speakeasies, to reveal a complicated and divided nation in the throes of momentous transformation. The film raises vital questions that are as relevant today as they were 100 years ago ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ about means and ends, individual rights and responsibilities, the proper role of government and finally, who is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and who is not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a real American.\n\n\nTechnical Specs for DVD XviD\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1400 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 29\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 94.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.05 GB (1,079 MB)\nEncoded by Harry65\nSource: DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2b29a9295f9e45b50468e0e15bdd74a405350d","amp;dn":"PBS.Prohibition.1of3.A.Nation.of.Drunkards.2011.XviD.AC3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2b29a9295f9e45b50468e0e15bdd74a405350d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,43,41,169,41,95,158,69,181,4,104,224,225,91,221,116,164,5,53,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
