It includes English subtitles, commentary\ntracks, and scans of the packaging, DVDs and booklet.  See the booklet scans\nfor further details on what Metrodome included in the collection. Each episode\nhas an avi with the video and Japanese audio. The subs and commentary are a\nseparate srt and mp3.\n\nUse VideoLAN, Media Player Classic, or any other media player capable of merging\naudio tracks and subtitles during playback.  The files are released in this\nformat to give the viewer the greatest flexibility in choosing their preferred\nplayback experience.\n\n\nBackground:\nVictory is the story of the new Cybertron Supreme Commander, Star Saber,\ndefending the Earth against the forces of Deszaras, the Destrons' new Emperor\nof Destruction. Deszaras desires the planet's energy to reactivate his massive\nplanet-destroying fortress, sealed away in the Dark Nebula long ago by Star Saber.\nThe series eschews the story arc-based approach of Headmasters and Masterforce,\nreturning to the American show's method of episodic adventures that did little to\nalter the status quo of the series, with a heavy emphasis on action, complemented\nby dynamic animation. Its cast consists almost entirely of brand new characters\n(although there are some guest appearances from characters on earlier shows).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36230a16bbdaec9e14e81d95f9b05a341757b4f7","amp;dn":"Transformers.Victory.1989.DVDRip.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36230a16bbdaec9e14e81d95f9b05a341757b4f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,35,10,22,187,218,236,158,20,232,29,149,249,176,90,52,23,87,180,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
