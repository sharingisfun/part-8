Rebels Resurgent: Fredericksburg to Chancellorsville is a ensential part of this series as this is the period when Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was at its best, not only defeating the Army of the Potomac, but literally fighting circles around them despite being at an extrme numerical disadvantage. Mr. Lincoln on the other hand, possessed his biggest challenge of the war: finding a commanding general in the east, who not only would take the fight to the enemy, but do it in a competent manner. Casualties were high, and results and morale were low. Again, a great book, illustrated in a correlating manner","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c540094c82f7275820c27ac43872117a3250b309","amp;dn":"Rebels+resurgent+%28Time-Life+The+Civil+War+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c540094c82f7275820c27ac43872117a3250b309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,64,9,76,130,247,39,88,32,194,122,196,56,114,17,122,50,80,179,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
