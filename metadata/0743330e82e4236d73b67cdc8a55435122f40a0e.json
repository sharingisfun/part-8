Focusing on inorganic chemistry, Francis AlbarÃƒÂ¨de's refreshing approach is brought to topics that range from measuring geological time to the understanding of climate change. The author leads the student through the necessary mathematics to understand the quantitative aspects of the subject in an easily understandable manner. The early chapters cover the principles and methods of physics and chemistry that underlie geochemistry, to build the students' understanding of concepts such as isotopes, fractionation, and mixing. These are then applied across many of the environments on Earth, including the solid Earth, rivers, and climate, and then extended to processes on other planets. \nThree new chapters have been added - on stable isotopes, biogeochemistry, and environmental geochemistry. End-of-chapter student exercises, with solutions available online, are also included. \n\nAbout the Author\nAlbarÃƒÂ¨de Francis is a French geochemist born in 1947. He is a professor at the Ãƒâ€°cole Normale SupÃƒÂ©rieure de Lyon and member of the Academia Europaea. Since January 2011, he was the first Director of the Laboratory of Geology Lyon.  He remained several years as a teacher and researcher since 1972 at the Institute of Earth Physics of Paris. In 1976 he defended a thesis state isotope geochemistry then spent two years in the USA (Caltech ) . In 1979 he was promoted to professor at the National School of Geology in Nancy , where he remained for 12 years. Finally, in 1991 he joined the Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon where he now serves as the director of the department of life sciences and earth.\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction 1\n1 The properties of elements 5\n2 Mass conservation and elemental fractionation 25\n3 Fractionation of stable isotopes 45\n4 Geochronology and radiogenic tracers 71\n5 Element transport 101\n6 Geochemical systems 120\n7 The chemistry of natural waters 138\n8 Biogeochemistry 168\n9 Environments 184\n10 Mineral reactions 202\n11 The solid Earth 218\n12 The Earth in the Solar System 248\n13 The element barn 288\nAppendix A Composition of the major geological units 303\nAppendix B The mixing equation for ratios 306\nAppendix C A refresher on thermodynamics 308\nAppendix D The geological time scale 315\nAppendix E An overview of analytical methods 316\nAppendix F Physical and geophysical constants 322\nAppendix G Some equations relative to residence time 323\nAppendix H The adiabatic atmosphere 325\nFurther reading 327\nIndex 330","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0743330e82e4236d73b67cdc8a55435122f40a0e","amp;dn":"Geochemistry+-+An+Introduction+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0743330e82e4236d73b67cdc8a55435122f40a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,67,51,14,130,228,35,109,115,182,124,220,138,85,67,81,34,244,10,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
