It is an age of antique cities, scientific sorcery, crystal machines, great flying engines with mechanical wings. And the armies of the Dark Empire are relentlessly taking over the once-peaceful city states, ravaging and destroying as they advance, mile by brutal mile . . . \n\nThe Dark Empire has humiliated and multilated Dorian Hawkmoon, but it cannot rob him of his two consuming passions: his love for Yisselda of Brass and his hatred of her ruthless suitor Meliadus. But before he can defy the Dark Empire and win the beauteous Yisselda, he must seek the Runestaff, a quest that will send him into barbaric wonder and perverse evil . . . and only if he succeeds will he avert the doom of all the world . . .This volume brings together all four volumes of Hawkmoon's remarkable adventure.\n\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86d61537474cf11e3422dbfbfb4887b42278f1b","amp;dn":"History+of+Runestaff+Omnibus+by+Michael+Moorcock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86d61537474cf11e3422dbfbfb4887b42278f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,109,97,83,116,116,207,17,227,66,45,191,191,180,136,123,66,39,143,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
