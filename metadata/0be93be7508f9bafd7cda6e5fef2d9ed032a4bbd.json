Comprised of vocalist/guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist/organist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett, Wolfmother took the initiative of recording a four-track demo in 2004 for the purpose of booking shows. So sterling were the results, however, that the band soon found itself re-recording the material for official release via the local label Modular Records. A second EP, Dimensions, appeared in 2006, and Wolfmother made the jump to the majors in early 2006, courtesy of an American distribution deal with Modular through Interscope Records. A self-titled album debut appeared in May and reached the Top 40, resulting in a trophy for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2007 Grammy Awards. Co-founders Ross and Heskett left the group the following year, leaving Stockdale and new members Ian Peres (bass, keyboards), Aidan Nemeth (guitar), and Dave Atkins (drums) to carry the torch with 2009's Cosmic Egg.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be93be7508f9bafd7cda6e5fef2d9ed032a4bbd","amp;dn":"Wolfmother+-+New+Crown+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be93be7508f9bafd7cda6e5fef2d9ed032a4bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,233,59,231,80,143,155,175,215,205,166,229,254,242,217,237,3,42,75,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
