These more than 50 projects for necklaces, earrings, and bracelets are all marvelously easy to make, using only the most basic stitches. Surround cabochons with a netting of beaded crochet to form the Opal or Stone Pendant Necklaces. The Pearl Frenzy necklace features freshwater pearls threaded into a chain-stitched design. For a matching set of jewels, try the Pretty in Pink or Snake ensembles. Each project includes color graphs and diagrams, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of information on stringing techniques, selecting the best fibers, combining different sizes and types of beads, and troubleshooting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db8ad8551ed322ed84cf763b2d66e0eaead23fc","amp;dn":"Designer+Beadwork%3A+Beaded+Crochet+Designs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db8ad8551ed322ed84cf763b2d66e0eaead23fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,184,173,133,81,237,50,46,216,76,247,99,178,214,110,14,174,173,35,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
