It challenges practice and guidelines which are biased or based on poor evidence. Guidance is offered on how to deal with difficult, sometimes controversial, situations.\n\nThe Midwife's Labour and Birth Handbook 3rd edition is an essential guide for both student midwives and experienced practising midwives.\n\nNew to this edition:\n\nFull colour photographs including a kneeling breech birth\nSuturing diagrams to assist left-handed midwives.\nExpanded chapters on slow progress in labour and malposition/malpresentations, including a rare photograph of a face presentation birth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:715dfb7980876d500b7e5cabaad1c0a023be6b02","amp;dn":"The+Midwife%27s+Labour+and+Birth+Handbook%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"715dfb7980876d500b7e5cabaad1c0a023be6b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,93,251,121,128,135,109,80,11,126,92,171,170,209,192,160,35,190,107,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
