said I, &quot;you do not know\nSilence like a cancer grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you&quot;\nBut my words like silent raindrops fell\nAnd echoed in the wells of silence\n\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said &quot;The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\nAnd whispered in the sound of silence \n\n\n02.- HOMEWARD BOUND (STUDIO VERSION)\n\nI'm sittin' in the railway station\nGot a ticket for my destination, mmm\nOn a tour of one night stands\nMy suitcase and guitar in hand\nAnd every stop is neatly planned\nFor a poet and a one-man band\n\nHomeward Bound, I wish I was\nHomeward Bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\n\nEvery day's an endless stream\nOf cigarettes and magazines\nAnd each town looks the same to me\nThe movies and the factories\nAnd every stranger's face I see\nReminds me that I long to be\n\nHomeward Bound, I wish I was\nHomeward Bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\n\nTonight I'll sing my songs again\nI'll play the game and pretend\nBut all my words come back to me\nIn shades of mediocrity\nLike emptiness in harmony\nI need someone to comfort me\n\nHomeward Bound, I wish I was\nHomeward Bound\nHome, where my thought's escaping\nHome, where my music's playing\nHome, where my love lies waiting\nSilently for me\nSilently for me\n\n\n03.- I AM A ROCK\n\nA winter's day\nIn a deep and dark December\nI am alone\nGazing from my window\nTo the streets below\nOn a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow\n\nI am a rock\nI am an island\n\nI've built walls\nA fortress deep and mighty\nThat none may penetrate\nI have no need of friendship\nFriendship causes pain\nIt's laughter and it's loving I disdain\n\nI am a rock\nI am an island\n\nDon't talk of love\nWell I've heard the word before\nIt's sleeping in my memory\nI won't disturb the slumber\nOf feelings that have died\nIf I never loved I never would have cried\n\nI am a rock\nI am an island\n\nI have my books\nAnd my poetry to protect me\nI am shielded in my armor\nHiding in my room\nSafe within my womb\nI touch no one and no one touches me\n\nI am a rock\nI am an island\n\nAnd a rock feels no pain\nAnd an island never cries \n\n\n04.- AMERICA\n\n&quot;Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together\nI've got some real estate here in my bag&quot;\nSo we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies\nAnd walked off to look for America\n\n&quot;Kathy,&quot; I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh\n&quot;Michigan seems like a dream to me now&quot;\nIt took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw\nI've come to look for America\n\nLaughing on the bus\nPlaying games with the faces\nShe said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy\nI said &quot;Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera&quot;\n\n&quot;Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat&quot;\n&quot;We smoked the last one an hour ago&quot;\nSo I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine\nAnd the moon rose over an open field\n\n&quot;Kathy, I'm lost,&quot; I said, though I knew she was sleeping\n&quot;I'm empty and aching and I don't know why&quot;\nCounting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike\nThey've all come to look for America\nAll come to look for America\nAll come to look for America \n\n\n05.- THE 59th STREET BRIDGE SONG\n\nSlow down, you move too fast\nYou've got to make the morning last\nJust kicking down the cobblestones\nLooking for fun and feeling groovy\nBa da da da da da da, feeling groovy\n\nHello lampost, what'cha knowing\nI've come to watch your flowers growin'\nAin'tcha got no rhymes for me\nDoo-it in doo doo, feeling groovy\nBa da da da da da da, feeling groovy\n\nI got no deeds to do\nNo promises to keep\nI'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep\nLet the morningtime drop all its petals on me\nLife I love you, all is groovy \n\n\n06.- CLOUDY\n\nCloudy\nThe sky is gray and white and cloudy\nSometimes I think it's hanging down on me\nAnd it's a hitchhike a hundred miles\nI'm a raga-muffin child\nPointed finger-painted smile\nI left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while\n\nCloudy\nMy thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy\nThey have no boreders, no boundaries\nThey echo and they swell\nFrom Tolstoi to Tinkerbell\nDown from Berkeley to Carmel\nGot some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill\n\nHey sunshine\nI haven't seen you in a long time\nWhy don't you show your face and bend my mind?\nThese clouds stick to the sky\nLike a floating question why\nAnd they linger there to die\nThey don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I\n\nCloudy\nCloudy \n\n\n07.- AT THE ZOO\n\nSomeone told me\nIt's all happening at the zoo\nI do believe it\nI do believe it's true\n\nIt's a light and tumble journey\nFrom the East Side to the park\nJust a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo\nBut you can take a crosstown bus\nIf it's raining or it's cold\nAnd the animals will love it if you do\n\nSomethin' tells me\nIt's all happening at the zoo\nI do believe it\nI do believe it's true\n\nThe monkeys stand for honesty\nGiraffes are insincere\nAnd the elephants are kindly but they're dumb\nOrangutans are skeptical\nOf changes in their cages\nAnd the zookeeper is very fond of rum\n\nZebras are reactionaries\nAntelopes are missionaries\nPigeons plot in secrecy\nAnd hamsters turn on frequently\nWhat a gas! You gotta come and see\nAt the zoo\n\n\n08.- EL CONDOR PASA\n\nI'd rather be a sparrow than a snail\nYes I would, if I could, I surely would\n\nI'd rather be a hammer than a nail\nYes I would, if I only could, I surely would\n\nAway, I'd rather sail away\nLike a swan that's here and gone\nA man gets tired out to the ground\nHe gives the world\nIts saddest sound\nIts saddest sound\n\nI'd rather be a forest than a street\nYes I would, if I could, I surely would\n\nI'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet\nYes I would, if I only could, I surely would \n\n\n09.- HAZY SHADE OF WINTER\n\nTime, time, time\nSee what's become of me\nWhile I looked around\nFor my possibilities\nI was so hard to please\nBut look around\nLeaves are brown\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\nHear the Salvation Army band\nDown by the riverside\nIt's bound to be a better ride\nThan what you've got planned\nCarry your cup in your hand\nAnd look around\nLeaves are brown\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\nHang onto your hopes, my friend\nThat's an easy thing to say\nBut if your hopes should pass away\nSimply pretend\nThat you can build them again\nLook around\nThe grass is high\nThe fields are ripe\nIt's the springtime of my life\n\nSeasons change with the scenery\nWeaving time in a tapestry\nWon't you stop and remember me\nAt any convenient time?\nFunny how my memory skips\nWhile looking over manuscripts\nOf unpublished rhyme\nDrinking my vodka and lime\nI look around\nLeaves are brown\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\nLook around\nLeaves are brown\nThere's a patch of snow on the ground \n\n\n10.- WE'VE GOT A GROOVY THING GOIN'\n\nBad news, bad news!\nI heard you're packing to leave\nI come a-running right over\nI just couldn't believe it\nI just couldn't believe it\n\nOh, baby, baby\nYou must be out of your mind\nDo you know what you're kicking away?\nWe've got a groovy thing goin', baby\nWe've got a groovy thing\n\nI never done you no wrong\nI never hit you whe you're down\nI always gave you good loving\nI never ran around\nI never ran around\n\nOh, baby, baby\nYou must be out of your mind\nDo you know what you're kicking away?\nWe've got a groovy thing goin', baby\nWe've got a groovy thing\n\nThere's something you ought to know\nIf you're fixing to go\nI can't make it without you\nNo no no no, no no\nNo no, no no no no no\n\nOh, baby, baby\nYou must be out of your mind\nDo you know what you're kicking away?\nWe've got a groovy thing goin', baby\nWe've got a groovy thing\n\nWe've got a groovy thing goin', baby\nWe've got a groovy thing \n\n\n11.- CECILIA\n\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please, to come home\n\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please, to come home\nCome on home\n\nMaking love in the afternoon\nWith Cecilia up in my bedroom\nI got up to wash my face\nWhen I come back to bed\nSomeone's taken my place\n\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\nOh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\nI'm begging you please, to come home\nCome on home\n\nJubilation, she loves me again\nI fall on the floor and I'm laughing\nJubilation, she loves me again\nI fall on the floor and I'm laughing \n\n\n12.- KEEP THE CUSTOMER SATISFIED\n\nGee but it's great to be back home\nHome is where I want to be\nI've been on the road so long my friend\nAnd if you came along\nI know you couldn't disagree\nIt's the same old story, yeah\nEverywhere I go\nI get slandered, libeled\nI hear words I never heard in the Bible\nAnd I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine\nTwo steps away from the county line\nJust trying to keep my customers satisfied\nSatisfied\n\nDeputy Sheriff said to me\n&quot;Tell me what you come here for, boy\nYou better get your bags and flee\nYou're in trouble, boy\nAnd now you're heading into more&quot;\nIt's the same old story\nEverywhere I go\nI get slandered, libeled\nI hear words I never heard in the Bible\nAnd I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine\nTwo steps away from the county line\nJust trying to keep my customers satisfied\nSatisfied\n\nAnd it's the same old story\nEverywhere I go\nI get slandered, libeled\nI hear words I never heard in the Bible\nAnd I'm so tired\nI'm oh so tired\nBut I'm trying to keep my customers satisfied\nSatisfied \n\n\n13.- MRS.

They're all that's left you \n\n\n18.- BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER (STUDIO VERSION)\n\nWhen you're weary, feeling small\nWhen tears are in your eyes,\nI will dry them all\nI'm on your side\nWhen times get rough\nAnd friends just can't be found\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\n\nWhen you're down and out\nWhen you're on the street\nWhen evening falls so hard\nI will comfort you\nI'll take your part\nWhen darkness comes\nAnd pain is all around\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will lay me down\n\nSail on silver girl\nSail on by\nYour time has come to shine\nAll your dreams are on their way\nSee how they shine\nIf you need a friend\nI'm sailing right behind\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will ease your mind\nLike a bridge over troubled water\nI will ease your mind \n\n\n19.- SONG FOR THE ASKING\n\nHere is my song for the asking\nAsk me and I will play\nSo sweetly, I'll make you smile\n\nThis is my tune for the taking\nTake it, don't turn away\nI've been waiting all my life\n\nThinking it over, I've been sad\nThinking it over, I'd be more than glad\nTo change my ways for the asking\n\nAsk me and I will play\nAll the love that I hold inside \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLyrics taken from Simon &amp;
