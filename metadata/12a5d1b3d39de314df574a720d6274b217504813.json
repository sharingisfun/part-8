Drake's original producer, the venerable Joe Boyd, wanted to recapture the intimacy of Drake's recordings while maintaining the late singer/songwriter's evocative spirit, so any instances of applause have been removed, resulting in a set that feels both wildly unpredictable and incredibly reverent, with highlights arriving via Vashti Bunyan's beautiful, Robert Kirby-arranged rendition of &quot;Which Will,&quot; Lisa Hannigan's haunting and spare version of &quot;Black Eyed Dog,&quot; and Robyn Hitchcock's kaleidoscopic retelling of Pink Moon's spooky &quot;Parasite.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12a5d1b3d39de314df574a720d6274b217504813","amp;dn":"VA+-+Way+to+Blue%3A+The+Songs+of+Nick+Drake+%5B2013%5D+%5BCompilation%5D%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12a5d1b3d39de314df574a720d6274b217504813","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,165,209,179,211,157,227,20,223,87,74,114,13,98,116,178,23,80,72,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
