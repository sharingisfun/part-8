Ã¢â‚¬Å“Playing and hanging out with Daryl was simultaneously beyond belief and totally naturalÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ just playing music. Any nerves I had went out the door eight bars in when I saw that we were all in the same pocket.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHe also added: Ã¢â‚¬Å“DarylÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real soulful, smart cat, and was totally open and warm as a host. The man, the band, and his whole family really showed me a great time, something I will remember for days and years to come.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFor Nick Waterhouse, it all began with a single vinyl 45, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Place,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which he recorded with Ã¢â‚¬Å“a band of twenty something kidsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and sax player Ira Raibon, a veteran of some of the same bands which produced the kind of lost classics that the singer-songwriter attempted to emulate. The release sold out shortly after it was released, and now changes hands for upwards of $300 on eBay for the rare copy. A fan of Ã¢â‚¬Å“vintage, over-modulated R&amp;BÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a time-honored tradition that evokes the back-alley thrill of New Orleans, Detroit and Memphis in their heyday,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Waterhouse recorded on magnetic tape direct to mono on the same Gold Star Studios lathe once used by Phil Spector and the Beach Boys. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The important thing to me was I did everything myself,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“On my own termsÃ¢â‚¬â€the way I wanted.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The subject of a June GQ profile and photo spread, Waterhouse begins a tour Sept. 26 in Denver , CO , which runs through Oct. 21 in L.A. at the El Rey Theatre.\n\nDaryl found he had a lot in common with his LFDH guest. &quot;We really bonded over our love of vintage R&amp;B and soul. NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real scholar of this music, and it turned out to be a great match.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c81817a3f9bccb9166b8668da943fea7b4175e0d","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Live.from.Daryl%27s.House.E58.Nick.Waterhouse.WEB-DL.%5BP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c81817a3f9bccb9166b8668da943fea7b4175e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,24,23,163,249,188,203,145,102,184,102,141,169,67,254,167,180,23,94,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
