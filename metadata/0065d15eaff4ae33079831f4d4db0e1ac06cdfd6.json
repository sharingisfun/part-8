The more risk you take on, the faster you can progress, but get busted by the cops and they take your speed points as a reward. Hundreds of thousands of speed points can be at stake at every turn and at every bust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will you go from hero to zero?\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8AH7FRm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8AH7FRm.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PdewGuk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PdewGuk.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MM4JMF9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MM4JMF9.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/duHHx8M.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/duHHx8M.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Tf2kIYf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Tf2kIYf.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.NET Framework v4.5 is required to run our new installer.Otherwise it will NFS Rivals has no story , which makes the videos useless.So that's why we ripped them.To do that it was not an easy job especially with frostbite 3,we had to understand how the engine call the files, then we forced the engine to ignore calling the video files.We have used our own programmed tools. crash.It's included in ISO. \n\nAlso we kept the training videos because without them the game won't allow you to start any race.
