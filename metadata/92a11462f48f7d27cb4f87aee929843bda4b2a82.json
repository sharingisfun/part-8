It was to be the last album with the original line-up.\n\nIt was released at a time when the band were starting to grow as performers, both live and in the studio, finding their direction musically. There were some conflicts over whether the band should continue on their rawer, heavier direction. This caused turmoil, which was partially responsible for two of the members, Nick Simper (bass) and Rod Evans (vocals), being replaced. Commercially, this album was the least successful of the three Mark I era albums.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Chasing Shadows&quot;   \t\n02. \t&quot;Blind&quot;   \t\n03. \t&quot;Lalena&quot;   \t\n04. \t&quot;Fault Line&quot;   \n05. \t&quot;The Painter&quot;   \t\t\n06. \t&quot;Why Didn't Rosemary?&quot;   \t\n07. \t&quot;Bird Has Flown&quot;   \t\n08. \t&quot;April&quot;\n   \t\nRemastered CD Bonus Tracks \n\t\n\n09. \t&quot;The Bird Has Flown&quot; (alternate b-side version) \t\n10. \t&quot;Emmaretta&quot; (single a-side) \t\n11. \t&quot;Emmaretta&quot; (BBC radio session; 16 January 1969) \t\n12. \t&quot;Lalena&quot; (BBC radio session; 6 June 1969) \n13. \t&quot;The Painter&quot; (BBC radio session; 6 June 1969) \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a11462f48f7d27cb4f87aee929843bda4b2a82","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Deep+Purple+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a11462f48f7d27cb4f87aee929843bda4b2a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,161,20,98,244,143,125,39,203,79,135,174,233,41,132,59,218,75,42,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
