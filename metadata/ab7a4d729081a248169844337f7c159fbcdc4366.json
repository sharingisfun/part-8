It covers the properties of coupled metal nanoparticles, the nonlinear optical response of metal nanoparticles, and the phenomena that arise when light-emitting materials are coupled to metal nanoparticles. It also provides an overview of key potential applications and offers explanations of computational and experimental techniques giving readers a solid grounding in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7a4d729081a248169844337f7c159fbcdc4366","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Metal-Nanoparticle+Plasmonics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7a4d729081a248169844337f7c159fbcdc4366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,122,77,114,144,129,162,72,22,152,68,51,127,124,21,159,188,220,67,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
