This is one of the worst. In the Minnesota town of Wayzata, an entire family has been killed Ã¢â‚¬â€ husband, wife, two kids, dogs. On the wall, in blood: &quot;Were coming.&quot; No apostrophe.\nThere's something about the scene that tugs at Lucas's cop instincts Ã¢â‚¬â€ it looks an awful lot like the kind of scorched-earth retribution he's seen from Mexican drug gangs. But this is a seriously upscale town, the husband ran a modest software company, the wife dabbled in local politics. None of it seems to fit.\nUntil it does. And that's when everybody starts coming to town: the DEA, the Mexican Federales, and some independent operators who are decidedly less welcome.\nWhere it all leads... will take Lucas into the darkest nightmare of his life.\nFilled with John Sandford's trademark razor-sharp plotting and some of the best characters in suspense fiction, Stolen Prey is further evidence for why the Cleveland Plain Dealer called the Davenport novels &quot;a perfect series.&quot; &quot;Grateful readers greet the annual appearance of Davenport with joy,&quot; it noted, &quot;then plan for a sleepless, page-turning night.&quot;\n\nThis is book number 22 in the Lucas Davenport series or some will call it the Prey series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfef50208beb2c539781a675a24d895048e19a64","amp;dn":"Stolen+Prey+by+John+Sandford+%28ePub%2C+Mobi%2C+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfef50208beb2c539781a675a24d895048e19a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,239,80,32,139,235,44,83,151,129,166,117,162,77,137,80,72,225,154,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
