You just walked home from the local record shop and you're sitting down in front of the turntable. You slide your thumbnail along the plastic to open up the album and remove the LP from its paper jacket. You carefully hold the edges of the record with your palms and set it down, pulling the tone arm over to drop the needle into the groove.\n\nThe guitar stylings of George Harrison are what you hear first, as &quot;Taxman&quot; plays through your phono speakers, a great new Beatles tune indeed. After listening to more of the record you hear the heady symbolism of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, the Beach Boys-like harmony of &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, the horns-rich McCartney kicker &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; and the Lennon acid-trip-set-to-music &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.\n\nYes, there are many other great tunes on this album...radio favorites like &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. And other greats like &quot;She Said, She Said&quot;, a song based on something Peter Fonda is said to have said to John Lennon, &quot;I know what it's like to be dead&quot;. How about &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and Lennon's beautiful &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;.\n\nAnd at the age of 17 in 1966, you do not yet know that &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; would help usher in a genre of music known as the Chicago-sound with bands like The Buckinghams, The Ides of March, The American Breed, Chicago and more using rich brass harmony. In 1966 you do not know that Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys was also sitting listening to Revolver, which in no small part spurred him on to create &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. And you don't realize that there are lush string quartets playing on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. String quartets on your local Top-40 radio station!! How can &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; with string quartets be played on-air alongside &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; by the Supremes or &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; by Tommy James &amp; the Shondells. Those are two great songs, but how do they compare to the orchestration and imagery of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;?\n\nThese guys were just the Beatles...a rowdy quartet from Liverpool, England, right? Not much different from Gerry and the Pacemakers or Freddie and the Dreamers??? Not anymore...not after Revolver. After Revolver, rock and roll changed. The music was now becoming Rock music, and bands like the Beatles were evolving into something new. British bands like The Yardbirds, The Who and The Pink Floyd were experimenting with exciting new sounds, and there was a whole new free-form sound in the U.S. coming out of San Francisco with bands like The Charlatans, The Great Society (later Jefferson Airplane), The Grateful Dead and others.\n\n&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; came out in `66, and then &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; came out in `67...this sealed the deal. Rock music was born.\n\nHow could you not own the CD &quot;Revolver&quot;? \n\nby  R.
