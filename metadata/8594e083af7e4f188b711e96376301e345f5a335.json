Almost double the amount of buildings and using all new effects of FSX, Manhattan X sets new standards. Designed with helicopters in mind, the scenery can also be explored with small aircrafts or ships. Even if you like to fly large aircraft you`ll enjoy the views when you approach the nearby airports.
