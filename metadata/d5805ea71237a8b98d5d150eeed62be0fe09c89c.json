As he wonders how to pay the rent, he discovers that he can see the contents of his mind unfolding whilst looking into his eyes in the mirror. He realises that he can apply his gift to others (&quot;If you can look inside yourself, you can look inside anyone!&quot;), and sets up a business in his room, selling tailor-made dreams to a variety of frustrated and neurotic clients. Each of the seven surreal dream sequences in the diegesis is in fact the creation of a contemporary avant-garde and/or surrealist artist.\n\nCollaborators included Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Alexander Calder, Darius Milhaud and Fernand LÃƒÂ©ger. The film won the Award for the Best Original Contribution to the Progress of Cinematography at the 1947 Venice Film Festival.\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 732,835,840 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:20:04\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 560x416 (AR: 1.346)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 982 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.169 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 102 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n\n\nENGLISH AUDIO, ENGLISH AND PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
