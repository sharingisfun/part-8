Beatles, Rolling Stones, you probably get the idea. I am definitely no where near a saint. This music is haunting. Just to think, before any popular or classical music was ever dreamt of, there was this. The human voice, chanting in praise to God. Very deep. No matter what your taste in music, buy this. The cd is perfect for those reflective times in your life. Times when you need to meditate and relax. Just let the sound encompass you. You will not be disappointed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a61a43fdb79b7157f9afdb0be8fd3fa7f84e76","amp;dn":"+Benedictine+Monks+Of+Santo+Domingo+De+Silos+-+Chant+1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a61a43fdb79b7157f9afdb0be8fd3fa7f84e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,166,26,67,253,183,155,113,87,249,175,219,11,232,253,63,167,248,78,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
