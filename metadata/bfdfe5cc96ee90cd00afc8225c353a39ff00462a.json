Networked Filtering and Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks introduces the subject of multi-sensor fusion as the method of choice for implementing distributed systems.\n\nThe book examines the state of the art in information fusion. It presents the known methods, algorithms, architectures, and models of information fusion and discusses their applicability in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Paying particular attention to the wide range of topics that have been covered in recent literature, the text presents the results of a number of typical case studies.\n\nComplete with research supported elements and comprehensive references, this teaching-oriented volume uses standard scientific terminology, conventions, and notations throughout. It applies recently developed convex optimization theory and highly efficient algorithms in estimation fusion to open up discussion and provide researchers with an ideal starting point for further research on distributed estimation and fusion for WSNs.\n\nThe book supplies a cohesive overview of the key results of theory and applications of information-fusion-related problems in networked systems in a unified framework. Providing advanced mathematical treatment of fundamental problems with information fusion, it will help you broaden your understanding of prospective applications and how to address such problems in practice.\n\nAfter reading the book, you will gain the understanding required to model parts of dynamic systems and use those models to develop distributed fusion control algorithms that are based on feedback control theory.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (November 25, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482250969\nISBN-13: 978-1482250961","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfdfe5cc96ee90cd00afc8225c353a39ff00462a","amp;dn":"Networked+Filtering+and+Fusion+in+Wireless+Sensor+Networks%28pdf%29%7B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfdfe5cc96ee90cd00afc8225c353a39ff00462a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,223,229,204,150,238,144,205,0,175,200,34,92,53,58,57,255,0,70,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
