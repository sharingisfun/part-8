But each time, something good, no matter how small, stops him.\r\n\r\nViolet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sisterâ€™s recent death.\r\n\r\nWhen Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, itâ€™s unclear who saves whom. And when they pair up on a project to discover the â€œnatural wondersâ€ of their state, both Finch and Violet make more important discoveries: Itâ€™s only with Violet that Finch can be himselfâ€”a weird, funny, live-out-loud guy whoâ€™s not such a freak after all. And itâ€™s only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violetâ€™s world grows, Finchâ€™s begins to shrink.\r\n\r\nThis is an intense, gripping novel perfect for fans of Jay Asher, Rainbow Rowell, John Green, Gayle Forman, and Jenny Downham from a talented new voice in YA, Jennifer Niven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2858fafe8b7389392aee5fdbc1e18012ac3e6a51","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Niven+-+All+the+Bright+Places","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2858fafe8b7389392aee5fdbc1e18012ac3e6a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,88,250,254,139,115,137,57,42,238,95,219,193,225,128,18,172,62,106,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
