This is art.\n\nYou will surely need to watch this work of art several times before you begin to grasp its intense and penetrating, although awful insight into the human condition.

It can be seen through the eyes of a tragedy, love story or criticism of social class. The construction of setting deliberates the costumes, and the dramatic colors of each setting construct several possible meanings. The filth and vulgarity evoke the constant emotion in the audience and hint at being references to social movements.\n\nFirst off the camera movement affects the audienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view. Continuous tracking shots guide the setting of the film. Starting outside, the spectator's view is far away from the characters. Moving towards the kitchen and then to the dining follows a continuous camera movement &quot;through the wall&quot;. Thus the camera movement is separated from the characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view giving the film an implicit theme of a play. Camera movements are also accompanied with music. Shown in the beginning kitchen scene, when the camera pan from left to right, the movement is timed with PupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singing. Also the charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stage movement during various events, the camera pans go from left to right. According to Johnston (2002), \n\n[Johnston, 2002]\n&quot;The reoccurring camera angles help structure the spatial organization of the film. This dominates the thematic and aesthetic depiction. You can look at this film just like as you look at a painting. GreenwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest in paintings is demonstrated throughout the film. Slow pans, rather than close-ups dominate multiple shots. Even the dining room table camera angles are consistent with the painting displayed behind them. The camera work rarely goes to a characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view. Instead a consistency of space is arranged. Rather than focusing on each characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view at the table, the camera perspectives portray the Dutch painting. These static camera views provide a fixed perspective, just like watching a play. This violent and obscure love story resembles a Jacobean drama as it implies ideas of moral corruption. Greenway's obvious interest in Jacobean dramas of this type inspires and drives the film's basic form; in the manner of a play. In terms of settings, The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover focuses almost entirely within the boundaries of three main areas: the street, the kitchen, and the restaurant which together serve as a rigidly structured environment within which most of the action occurs&quot;\n[/Johnston, 2002]\n\nEach different setting is assigned an explicit color code and certain style. These spaces are symbolic in many ways. The director uses art, history, and different time periods along with political dimensions dictated in each room. The film begins with a brutal scene of Albert beating and defiling a man. Already, Albert is depicted as a monstrous man who uses vulgar and obscene language. Blue lighting dominates the outside setting as well as the truck but is contracted by subtle yellows. Two trucks are set in the scene, one containing ice and the other meat. The meat truck (on the right) shows a young boy who is leaning out the back. This can symbolize the idea of the body as he accompanies the various assortments of meat. On the left side of the frame, a second truck illumines its surroundings slightly in soft yellow, contrasting the dark blues of the scene. Within this truck is a young woman apparently sucking on a piece of ice. This, one can interpret as representing sexuality. This opening scene hints at the upcoming narrative. Crime is both committed and symbolized in this scene, as Albert beats a naked, defiled man. The lighting of this scene gives allusions of the violence and dark uprising within the film. Though separated from the main settings, the outside parking lot dictates the threats that radiate from the inside setting. Towards the end of the film the meat truck contains rotting flesh, perhaps depicting the pollution of society, or its inevitable decay.\n\nRed lighting illuminates the restaurant putting emphasis on the narrativeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s violence. The main symbolic purpose of the restaurant is the staging of class and respectable society. A main focus in the restaurant is the painting seen behind AlbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s table, which is also his main meeting place. According to DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Arcy (1999), the painting by Frans Hal, a group portrait of Officers of the Civic Guard was painted in 1616. HalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painting represents the committee involved in Dutch political affairs during this time period. The connection between the painting and the film is the obvious remaking of the Dutch clothes worn by Albert and his men. They are also positioned in a similar manner around the table that mirrors the picture. Therefore this room represents the turning of the century as well as early seventeenth-century social system. Albert and his gang can then be compared to seventeenth century anti-statism. He and his crew use vulgar language and cause chaos in the restaurant, representing complete consumerism. This interpretation of the restaurant provides the basis of the narrative, and the motive of the affair (DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Arcy, 1999).\n\nThe remaining settings; the womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s restroom and kitchen are accompanied by specific color schemes that represent different historical and social elements. The rooms emphasize different era in history. The kitchen is dictated by green lighting, and the kitchen staff wears grubby, white clothing. Also, the white color of the restroom is thought to allude to modernism and the 20Ã¡Âµâ€”ÃŠÂ° century.\n\nAnother use of mise-en-scene is the way all the characters' costumes change according to their surroundings. Michael, or the lover, is the only character whose costume remains static. He is and remains dressed in brown, and constantly reading French revolutionary books. He perhaps symbolizes the mind, and change. His language and brown clothing give him a rational appeal. Michael is always well tempered, even when confronted by Albert. Even during GeorginaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revenge, he is still seen in brown.\n\n\nVideo Details:\n--------------\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Peter Greenway - The Cook The Thief His Wife And Her Lover (1989).avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 7.64 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 3mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 8 821 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d29abbb5ba929ee6fce3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 5 frames\nCodec ID                                 : AVC1\nDuration                                 : 2h 3mn\nBit rate                                 : 8 271 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 816 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                               : 24.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.220\nStream size                              : 7.16 GiB (94%)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 9s 683ms\nSource duration                          : 2h 3mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 170 MiB (2%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c2550d525b7958e1b2402fce7208995a6d1795","amp;dn":"The.Cook.The.Thief.His.Wife.And.Her.Lover.Peter.Greenaway.1989.B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c2550d525b7958e1b2402fce7208995a6d1795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,194,85,13,82,91,121,88,225,178,64,47,206,114,8,153,90,109,23,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
