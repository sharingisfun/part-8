However, some have been all new content, not released before in novel format. The series, like the novels they are based on, are set in a future where mankind is facing annihilation by an aggressive alien society, an insect-like race known colloquially as &quot;Buggers&quot; but more formally as &quot;Formics.&quot; The central character, Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, is one of the child soldiers trained at Battle School (and eventually Command School) to be the future leaders of the protection of Earth. The year is never specified, although the ages of the Wiggin children are specified to change throughout space, also carefully taking in the relativity of space and time.\n\n\nAlternate reading order - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_%28comics%29#Chronological_order_of_series\n\nFiles include what alternate covers I could find\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_%28comics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_%28comics%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://io9.com/5029258/this-is-what-enders-game-will-look-like-from-now-on&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://io9.com/5029258/this-is-what-enders-game-will-look-like-from-now-on&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\n00 - Gold Bug (from Red Prophet The Tales of Alvin Maker Vol. 1 HC)\\Gold Bug.cbr 12.0 MB\n\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\\Ender's Game - Battle School 01.cbr 12.1 MB\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\\Ender's Game - Battle School 02.cbr 15.4 MB\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\\Ender's Game - Battle School 03.cbr 10.8 MB\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\\Ender's Game - Battle School 04.cbr 14.0 MB\n01 - Ender's Game - Battle School\\Ender's Game - Battle School 05.cbr 14.4 MB\n\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\\Ender's Shadow - Battle School 01.cbr 23.2 MB\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\\Ender's Shadow - Battle School 02.cbr 13.4 MB\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\\Ender's Shadow - Battle School 03.cbr 16.5 MB\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\\Ender's Shadow - Battle School 04.cbr 16.5 MB\n02 - Ender's Shadow - Battle School\\Ender's Shadow - Battle School 05.cbr 16.6 MB\n\n03 - Ender's Game - Recruiting Valentine\\Ender's Game - Recruiting Valentine.cbr 17.2 MB\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\\Ender's Game - Command School 01.cbr 14.9 MB\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\\Ender's Game - Command School 02.cbr 15.4 MB\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\\Ender's Game - Command School 03.cbr 14.7 MB\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\\Ender's Game - Command School 04.cbr 14.5 MB\n04 - Ender's Game - Command School\\Ender's Game - Command School 05.cbr 17.9 MB\n\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\\Ender's Shadow - Command School 01.cbr 17.2 MB\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\\Ender's Shadow - Command School 02.cbr 16.5 MB\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\\Ender's Shadow - Command School 03.cbr 17.0 MB\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\\Ender's Shadow - Command School 04.cbr 15.9 MB\n05 - Ender's Shadow - Command School\\Ender's Shadow - Command School 05.cbr 15.5 MB\n\n06 - Ender's Game - War of Gifts\\Ender's Game - War of Gifts.cbr 30.7 MB\n\n07 - Ender's Game - Mazer in Prison\\Ender's Game - Mazer in Prison Special.cbr 14.0 MB\n\n08 - Ender's Game - The League War\\Ender's Game - The League War.cbr 16.3 MB\n\n09 - Ender In Exile\\Ender In Exile 01.cbr 14.2 MB\n09 - Ender In Exile\\Ender In Exile 02.cbr 16.9 MB\n09 - Ender In Exile\\Ender In Exile 03.cbr 14.1 MB\n09 - Ender In Exile\\Ender In Exile 04.cbr 16.4 MB\n09 - Ender In Exile\\Ender In Exile 05.cbr 19.5 MB\n\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\\Speaker For The Dead 01.cbr 22.0 MB\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\\Speaker For The Dead 02.cbr 22.1 MB\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\\Speaker For The Dead 03.cbr 23.3 MB\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\\Speaker For The Dead 04.cbr 23.9 MB\n10 - Speaker For The Dead\\Speaker For The Dead 05.cbr 22.0 MB\n\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 01.cbr 24.1 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 02.cbr 20.5 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 03.cbr 21.8 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 04.cbr 22.2 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 05.cbr 23.9 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 06.cbr 22.3 MB\n11 - Formic Wars - Burning Earth\\Formic Wars - Burning Earth 07.cbr 21.6 MB\n\nTorrent downloaded from46 B ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13d5751e9d117abe166e96d083ec9b86b35e91ab","amp;dn":"Ender%5C%27s+Game+%28up-todate%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13d5751e9d117abe166e96d083ec9b86b35e91ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,213,117,30,157,17,122,190,22,110,150,208,131,236,155,134,179,94,145,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
