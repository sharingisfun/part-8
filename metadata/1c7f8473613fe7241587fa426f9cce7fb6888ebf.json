That he has recorded Handel, Mozart and Shostakovich in addition to this album of Bach indicates that he has reached a level of musicianship that few will ever equal, let alone surpass. \n\nThese recordings were performed on a modern piano. However, of course, the modern piano did not exist when Bach wrote the pieces. So Jarrett's interpretation has a narrow range of expression, reflecting the fact that originally these pieces were most likely performed on a harpsichord. \n\nOff and on I've been listening to these recordings for 15 years now, and as an amateur pianist myself have found them invaluable when trying to interpret the original sheet music. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7f8473613fe7241587fa426f9cce7fb6888ebf","amp;dn":"J+S+BACH+-+The+Well+Tempered+Clavier%3A+Book+1+%28Keith+Jarrett%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c7f8473613fe7241587fa426f9cce7fb6888ebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,127,132,115,97,63,231,36,21,135,250,66,111,156,206,127,182,136,142,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
