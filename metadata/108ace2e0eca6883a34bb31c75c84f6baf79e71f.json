In 1942, at the behest of retired journalist Karl Bickel, Evans journeyed to Sarasota to take photographs for The Mangrove Coast, a book Bickel was writing about the long and colorful history of FloridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gulf Coast. \n\nFeatured in Walker Evans: Florida are the surprising images Evans took during that six-week stay in the area, which constitute a little-known chapter in EvansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinguished career. Far from stereotypical postcard pictures of sandy beaches and palm trees, Evans captured a region of contradictions. Here in the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seaside vacationland, Evans focused his lens on decaying architecture, crowded street scenes, retirees, and numerous images of animals, railroad cars, and circus wagons from Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, whose winter home was Sarasota. \n\nAccompanying the fifty-two images in Walker Evans: Florida is novelist Robert PlunketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wry account of the human and geographic landscape of Florida.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108ace2e0eca6883a34bb31c75c84f6baf79e71f","amp;dn":"Walker+Evans+-+Florida+%28Photography+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108ace2e0eca6883a34bb31c75c84f6baf79e71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,138,206,46,14,202,104,131,163,75,179,28,117,200,79,107,175,121,231,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
