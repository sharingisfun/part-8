It brings to life an array of irresistible characters - the \nawesomely self-confident Tom, his best buddy Huck Finn, indulgent Aunt \nPolly, and the lovely, beguiling Becky - as well as such unforgettable \nincidents as whitewashing a fence, swearing an oath in blood, and \ngetting lost in a dark and labyrinthine cave. Below Tom Sawyer's \nsunny surface lurk hints of a darker reality, of youthful innocence and \nnaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯vetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© confronting the cruelty, hypocrisy, and foolishness of the adult \nworld - a theme that would become more pronounced in Twain's Adventures \nof Huckleberry Finn. Despite such suggestions, Tom Sawyer remains \nTwainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s joyful ode to the endless possibilities of childhood. \n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a popular 1876 novel about\na young boy growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. The \nstory is set in the town of &quot;St Petersburg&quot;, inspired by Hannibal, \nMissouri, where Mark Twain grew up. In the story's introduction, Twain \nnotes:\n  &quot;Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two \nwere experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates \nof mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an \nindividualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom \nI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48d65fc1c5a3c4cfa2ab084a0835f042890a8502","amp;dn":"TOM+SAWYER+-+Mark+Twain.+Read+by+William+Dufris+%7BFerraBit%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48d65fc1c5a3c4cfa2ab084a0835f042890a8502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,214,95,193,197,163,196,207,162,171,8,74,8,53,240,66,137,10,133,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
