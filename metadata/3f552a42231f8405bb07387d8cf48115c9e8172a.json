They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band.\r\n\r\nDream Theater - Legacy (EP) 2016 ak\r\n\r\n\r\nTracks\r\n\r\n1.
