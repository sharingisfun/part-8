Yet leaders often spend most of their time running from crisis to crisis.\nIn his groundbreaking New York Times bestseller Built to Serve, United Supermarkets CEO Dan Sanders showed how putting profi ts before people encourages organizational chaos, saps motivation, stifles innovation, and undercuts competitiveness. He also unveiled a revolutionary peoplecentered business model championed by United and challenged other business leaders to put the human factor first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ca64db1fcd1c0462297309aebe93bd1cb5af419","amp;dn":"Equipped+to+Lead%3A+Managing+People%2C+Partners%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ca64db1fcd1c0462297309aebe93bd1cb5af419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,166,77,177,252,209,192,70,34,151,48,154,235,233,59,209,203,90,244,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
