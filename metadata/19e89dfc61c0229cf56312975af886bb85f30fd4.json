The benefits of this approach include Tony Levinâ€™s upright bowed bass on the coda having the same space to chug up to the front of the sound. Frame is taken at a calmer pace so that the English guitarist in the group doesnâ€™t have fingertips ablaze as a result of the double time phase shifts both during and at the end of the song.\r\n\r\nA perfect One Time and an astonishingly vibrant Red auger well for the rolling and tumbling we get on Bâ€™boom; Bruford and Mastelotto really make this version come alive. During the improv section of Thrak Bruford executes some beautifully funky pockets but his buddies decline to lock in and get all freewheeling above the beat. As Bruf opts for his xylophone setting Pat keeps the groove going. Itâ€™s tight stuff throughout.\r\n\r\nIndiscipline tonight is particularly incendiary and even the old warhorse, Elephant Talk, dances with a real spring in its step. Though there have been times when the inclusion of the percussion showcase Conundrum has dissipated the flow of the gig, The Talking Drum and LTIA quickly get things back up to speed. A brilliant performance from start to finish here.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n01 - VROOOM\r\n02 - Coda: Marine 475\r\n03 - Frame By Frame\r\n04 - Dinosaur\r\n05 - One Time\r\n06 - Red\r\n07 - B'Boom\r\n08 - THRAK\r\n09 - Matte Kudasai\r\n10 - Sex, Sleep, Eat, Drink, Dream\r\n11 - People\r\n12 - VROOOM VROOOM\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n01 - Indiscipline\r\n02 - Improv Two Sticks\r\n03 - Elephant Talk\r\n04 - Prism\r\n05 - The Talking Drum\r\n06 - Larks' Tongues In Aspic Pt II\r\n07 - Walking On Air\r\n\r\n* 1995, 2010 Discipline Global Mobile / King Crimson\r\n{DGM 16/44 Official Digital Download} (dgmlive.com)\r\n\r\nAudio Source: Dat Soundboard\r\nDGM Audio Quality Rating: 5 stars\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nAdrian Belew - Guitar, Voice, Words\r\nBill Bruford - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\nRobert Fripp - Guitar\r\nTrey Gunn - Touch Guitar, Voice\r\nTony Levin - Basses, Chapman Stick, Voice\r\nPat Mastelotto - Acoustic and Electronic Percussions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore King Crimson DGM Official Digital Download:\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Crimson - Teatro Smeraldo, Milan, Italy - May 02, 1995 (2010):\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14602698/King_Crimson_-_Teatro_Smeraldo__Milan__Italy_-_May_02__1995\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Crimson - Kulturhaus, Dornbirn, Austria - May 01, 1995 (2010) [2CD]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/15280793/King_Crimson_-_Kulturhaus__Dornbirn__Austria_-_May_01__1995","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e89dfc61c0229cf56312975af886bb85f30fd4","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-+Teatro+Tenda%2C+Florence%2C+Italy+-+May+03%2C+1995+%5B2CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e89dfc61c0229cf56312975af886bb85f30fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,232,157,252,97,192,34,156,245,99,18,151,90,248,134,187,133,243,15,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
