Feynman\nSeries: Princeton Science Library\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0691125759\nISBN-13: 978-0691125756\n\nCelebrated for his brilliantly quirky insights into the physical world, Nobel laureate Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the general public. Here Feynman provides a classic and definitive introduction to QED (namely, quantum electrodynamics), that part of quantum field theory describing the interactions of light with charged particles. Using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned &quot;Feynman diagrams&quot; instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman clearly and humorously communicates both the substance and spirit of QED to the layperson. A. Zee's introduction places Feynman's book and his seminal contribution to QED in historical context and further highlights Feynman's uniquely appealing and illuminating style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7e92c8e208fdcc66601ebe704efa70e53fbd3d","amp;dn":"QED+The+Strange+Theory+of+Light+and+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7e92c8e208fdcc66601ebe704efa70e53fbd3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,126,146,200,226,8,253,204,102,96,30,190,112,78,250,112,229,63,189,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
