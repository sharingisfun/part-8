Glitch Side Of The Moon (Bonus Track) [4:59]\n\n\n\nDigital Evolution is the debut album and first independent release of UK artist Illectrix.\n\nIncorporating a mixture of electronic synthesis, meticulously chopped-up vinyl samples and live instrumentation, it takes electronic dance music to a whole new level - pulling in elements of soul, funk-rock, jazz and blues, and then smashing them together with the raw and gritty bass-driven sounds of electro, glitch-hop and hip-hop.\n\nAs Illectrix elaborates, he picked the name Digital Evolution for this record &quot;as that is exactly what it is - an evolution of sound, ideas and emotions, that have been digitally transformed from their natural roots into something that is almost unrecognisable, yet so much more powerful and beautiful than before. It is the evolution of freedom and individualism - the release of musical expression and creativity from the shackles of consumerism and commercialisation that drive so much of the music we hear today.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd55a826c283d298003565a04525d569af7eb43","amp;dn":"Illectrix+-+Digital+Evolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd55a826c283d298003565a04525d569af7eb43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,213,90,130,108,40,61,41,128,3,86,90,4,82,93,86,154,247,235,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
