Heavy on visual inspiration, Collaborative Art Journals and Shared Visions in Mixed Media covers various organizational structures for collaborative art projects, offers instructions and tips for organizing such ventures, and includes interviews with organizers and participants of collaborative projects, as well as a healthy smattering of techniques including how to create books that can be added to as they travel and how to devise various binding structures for different paper projects.\n\nAbout the Author\nL.K. Ludwig (Zelienople, PA) creates art and chases her three small children around in a Victorian Foursquare in a very small town (pop. 4,023) in Western Pennsylvania. Many weekends are spent in the woods and at the river where family memories and art are made. With a strong belief in creating around what she knowsÃ¢â‚¬â€nature, parenting, love, and lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€these elements seep deeply into L.K.'s artwork. Her work has been featured in a number of books and magazines and shown in various galleries. She is author of True Vision.\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION 9\nChapter 1: The Artistic Conversation\nChapter 2: Practical Considerations\nChapter 3: Art Journal Collaboratives\nChapter 4: Altered Book Round Robins\nChapter 5: Retreat Swaps\nChapter 6: Art Exchanges\nChapter 7: Collaborative Mixed-Media Exchanges\nReader Invitation: Shared Vision Exchange\nPROJECT INDEX 137\nCONTRIBUTOR LIST 136\nRESOURCES 143\nABOUT THE AUTHOR &amp; AKNOWLEDGMENTS 144","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45650319704e5bd7a9b851e9ae1019f175e9195f","amp;dn":"Collaborative+Art+Journals+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45650319704e5bd7a9b851e9ae1019f175e9195f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,101,3,25,112,78,91,215,169,184,81,233,174,16,25,241,117,233,25,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
