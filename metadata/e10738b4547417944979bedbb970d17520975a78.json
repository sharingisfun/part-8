On China.org.cn, a government site, reported that the nation's citizens were &quot;incensed&quot; over the free download and were now &quot;rally together to denounce Apple.&quot;\n\nWhat ever happened to all those promises of a free and open Games?\n\nYou know a government must be really insecure when they think that Moby and Sting songs could lead to an overturning of the political applecart.\n\n\nKids, always remember xenu is your friend.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10738b4547417944979bedbb970d17520975a78","amp;dn":"Songs+for+Tibet+-+The+Art+of+Peace+%282008%29+%5B192+kbit%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10738b4547417944979bedbb970d17520975a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,7,56,180,84,116,23,148,73,121,190,219,185,112,209,117,32,151,90,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
