Ã¢â‚¬Å“TECHNIQUES,\nMANHANDLING, AND CLOSE COMBAT,\nFOR POLICE AND THE MILITARY&quot; \n\nPersonal combat conforms to no set rules of conduct, as\nthe fighting in Korea so plainly proved. Were we, the United\nStates, the choosers, it would not be thus; the decencies of\nhuman conduct would be observed. But we must be ready to\nfight against an utterly ruthless communist enemy, one who\nfeels he must win at any cost, even at the cost of human\ndecency.\nThe American soldier who meets such an enemy is forced\nto adapt himself to a pattern of behavior that is foreign to his\neducation and his religious beliefs. If he would win the fightÃ¢â‚¬â€\nindeed, if he himself would surviveÃ¢â‚¬â€he must know all the\ndirty tricks of close combat, even as the enemy knows them.\nHe must match them trick for trick. Further, he must be able\nto take the initiative and attack an enemy soldier as ruthlessly\nas he, in turn, would be attacked if he waited. It is a split\n\nsecond business. There is no time allowed for moral debate.\nIn close combat, it is now or never.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b484fd9fef2cc135b31af825763b0393b276a2a2","amp;dn":"Kill+or+Get+Killed-Marine+FM-12-80","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b484fd9fef2cc135b31af825763b0393b276a2a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,132,253,159,239,44,193,53,179,26,248,37,118,59,3,147,178,118,162,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
