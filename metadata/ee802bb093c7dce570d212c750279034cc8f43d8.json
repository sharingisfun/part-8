Armed with dense, tent revival vocal harmonies and bright country-inflected pop arrangements, the band feels at times like a pastoral version of the Polyphonic Spree, capturing a sense of exuberance and earnestness that has the potential to disarm even the most cynical listeners. This unabashed approach to songwriting makes Alright You Restless a refreshing departure from the waves of murky, detached pop that came in vogue with the rise of chillwave, offering listeners a brighter, more joyous alternative to lead them out of the musical fog. A lot of the credit for this light, effulgent sound goes to AgesandAges' huge seven-member lineup. Despite having so many cooks in the kitchen, the arrangements sound crisp and spontaneous, giving the album a real Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the momentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feeling that mightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been lost had Perry decided to make this a bedroom recording project rather than a full-band affair. As it stands, the band is able to negotiate its way to a sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dense without ever becoming completely impenetrable, allowing all of the elements to shine through on songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“So So FreelyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tap on Your Windowpane.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In a way, Alright You Restless is an exercise in balance, maintaining enough ebullience to be engaging and uplifting without feeling theatrical or manic. This is a line that AgesandAges walk artfully, making their debut album one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll leave fans hungry for a follow-up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee802bb093c7dce570d212c750279034cc8f43d8","amp;dn":"AgesAndAges+-+Alright+You+Restless+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee802bb093c7dce570d212c750279034cc8f43d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,128,43,176,147,199,220,229,112,210,18,199,80,39,144,52,204,143,67,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
