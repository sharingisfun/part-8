While the courtship and reproductive patterns of animals had been carefully documented, Kinsey believed that most &quot;established facts&quot; about human sexual behavior were a matter of conjecture rather than research and that what most people said about their sex lives was not born out by the evidence (a subject that had personal resonance for him given the troubles he and his wife Clara Kinsey had in the early days of their marriage). After introducing a course in &quot;Marriage&quot; at Indiana University which offered frank and factual information on sex to students, Kinsey began an exhaustive series of interviews with a wide variety of people from all walks of life in order to find out the truth about sex practices in America. When he published Sexual Behavior and the Human Male in 1948, his findings were wildly controversial, indicating that most men had a wider variety of sexual experiences than most people imagined, including a number of practices commonly thought to be dangerous or perverted (including pre-marital sex, same-sex contacts, and masturbation). An even greater outcry greeted Kinsey's next volume, Sexual Behavior and the Human Female, which contradicted common notions than most women went into marriage sexually inexperienced. Kinsey is a film biography written and directed by Bill Condon which examines Kinsey's life and work from his strict childhood until his death in 1956. Liam Neeson plays Alfred Kinsey, and Laura Linney co-stars as Kinsey's wife and colleague Clara. John Lithgow highlights the supporting cast as Kinsey's repressed and moralistic father, while Chris O'Donnell, Peter Sarsgaard, and Timothy Hutton play members of Kinsey's research team and Tim Curry appears as an IU faculty member at odds with Kinsey's teachings.\n\n\n\n************************************\n\n- Duration: 1h 56mn\n\n- Nominal bit rate: 1352 Kbps\n\n- Res: 1280 x 720\n\n- AR: 16:9\n\n- FPS: 23.976 fps\n\n- Audio: AAC, 2 channels, 128Kbps\n\n************************************\n\n\n\nGeneral\n--------------\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size : 1.20 GiB\nDuration : 1h 56mn\nOverall bit rate : 1476 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-10-01 17:58:22\nWriting application : mkvmerge v7.2.0 ('On Every Street') 64bit built on Sep 13 2014 15:52:10\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\n\n\n\nVideo\n------------\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;de93bfb7b09e92edf0ef&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 56mn\nNominal bit rate : 1352 Kbps\nWidth : 1280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.061\nWriting library : x264 core 130 r2273\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=4\nLanguage : English\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\n\nAudio\n----------\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nDuration : 1h 56mn\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nLanguage : English\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1753a2d04427e311f85481b511aa08ed33d70071","amp;dn":"Kinsey+2004+720p+HDRip+x264+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1753a2d04427e311f85481b511aa08ed33d70071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,83,162,208,68,39,227,17,248,84,129,181,17,170,8,237,51,215,0,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
