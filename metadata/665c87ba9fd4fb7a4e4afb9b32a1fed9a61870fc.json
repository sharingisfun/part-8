Despite the slight confusion over what the album promises and what it delivers, it's a pleasant collection, although the new age pieces, such as &quot;Black Sand,&quot; &quot;Seven Pools,&quot; and &quot;Morning With Philda&quot; don't always mesh well with the classical compositions. However, pieces such as Chopin's Nocturne in C minor and Polonaise in C sharp minor and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A major, K. 488: Andante work well in the open-air atmosphere that the nature recordings provide. Although Zen Garden: Inspiring Creation is both a purer and more diverse-sounding collection, this is still an enjoyable and soothing -- if not exactly Zen -- compilation. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi\n\nRead more: http://www.answers.com/topic/zen-garden-relaxing-meadows#ixzz2YnvU7knV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665c87ba9fd4fb7a4e4afb9b32a1fed9a61870fc","amp;dn":"Zen+Garden+Earth+Sings+-+Relaxing+Meadows+MP3+192+kb%2Fs+44100MHz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665c87ba9fd4fb7a4e4afb9b32a1fed9a61870fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,92,135,186,159,212,251,122,78,74,251,155,50,161,254,217,166,24,112,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
