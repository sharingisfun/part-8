The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique pioneered by Ford. It also makes use of the device of the unreliable narrator, as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads you to believe. The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford's messy personal life.\n\nThe novel opens with the famous line, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the saddest story I have ever heard.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dowell explains that for nine years he, his wife Florence and their friends Captain Edward Ashburnham (the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgood soldierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title) and his wife Leonora had an ostensibly normal friendship while Edward and Florence sought treatment for their heart ailments at a spa in Nauheim, Germany.\n\nIn a &quot;Dedicatory Letter to Stella FordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that prefaces the novel, Ford reports that a friend pronounced The Good Soldier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe finest French novel in the English language!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91253d90a007b924608bc2d56c664df114fbe979","amp;dn":"THE+GOOD+SOLDIER+-+Ford+Madox+Ford.+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91253d90a007b924608bc2d56c664df114fbe979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,37,61,144,160,7,185,36,96,139,194,213,108,102,77,241,20,251,233,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
