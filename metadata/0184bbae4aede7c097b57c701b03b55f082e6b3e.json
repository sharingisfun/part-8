As their music has opened hip-hop to a wider audience and changed the parameters of its sound, their ambitious music videos have carried the medium to new levels of artistic expression. This groundbreaking anthology showcases the vast potential of technology, with most of the eighteen videos containing alternate visual angles and multiple audio tracks. There are hundreds of possible image and sound combinations, including new surround mixes, versions, instrumentals, and more than 40 remixes (by such artists as Moby, Fatboy Slim and the Prunes), including many new remixes created exclusively for this release.\n\nLoaded with never-before-seen footage and unreleased music tracks, this also contains a trove of rare still photos and exclusive audio commentary by the band and the video directors. And the coup de grace; the world-premiere director's cut of Nathanial Hornblower's Intergalactic spin-off.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDVD1\n1. Intergalactic\n2. Shake Your Rump\n3. Gratitude\n4.
