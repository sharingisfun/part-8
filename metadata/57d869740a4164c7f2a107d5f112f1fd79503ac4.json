Hailing from Seattle, the expert authors are perfectly placed to guide novices, professionals, and hopeless hortoholics looking for hot new plants. \n\n\nThis appealing compendium of nearly 3,000 plant entries offers engrossing, high-spirited commentary to help in selecting and caring for vast arrays of species and cultivated varieties.\n\n\n Background information accompanies cultural advice, helping to take the mystery out of cultivating herbaceous blooming beauties, semievergreen selections rising from rhizomes, vigorous ground covers, and dramatic foliage specimens. \n\n\nAnd easy-to-follow charts aid in the understanding of Anemones and other such large genera. Common names, plant sources, and recommended reading complete entries from Acaena to Zantedeschia, making this exceptional resource a must-have for library collections.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d869740a4164c7f2a107d5f112f1fd79503ac4","amp;dn":"Perennials%3A+The+Gardener%5C%27s+Reference+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57d869740a4164c7f2a107d5f112f1fd79503ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,216,105,116,10,65,100,199,242,161,7,213,241,18,241,253,121,80,58,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
