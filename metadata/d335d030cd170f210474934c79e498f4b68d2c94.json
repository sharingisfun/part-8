The highlights are without a doubt Francis Monkman's two compositions, Cannonball and the five-movement abolsutely stunning Where Opposites Meet. This really was a meeting of styles and approaches to music-making. Carillon set the trend for Sky to include a straight, simple tune on each album, played without any histrionics, and Eric Satie's Gymnopedie paved the ground for further classical arrangements, not all as calm as this one! Dies Irae, which most fans heard for the first time when the previously (little-sold) single was included on the CD release ten years later, is further indication of Francis Monkman's unique compositional and arranging talents for this particular ensemble.\n\nBand Members:\n\nTristan Fry\ndrum kit &amp; percussion\n\nKevin Peek\nacoustic\n&amp; electric guitars\n\nFrancis Monkman\npiano, synths\n&amp; harpsichord\n\nHerbie Flowers\nelectric &amp; string bass\n\nJohn Williams\nacoustic\nguitars\n\n\nRipped using Nero\n\n\nQuality:\n\n\n192kbps\n\n44khz\n\nStereo\n\n\n\nVery rare album to find on p2p or torrent sites so I thought id rip the CD I have and share it with you all.\n\nHope it makes some people happy.\n\n\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d335d030cd170f210474934c79e498f4b68d2c94","amp;dn":"Sky+-+Vol.+1+%28Classic+80s+Instrumental+Group%29+RARE+Album%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d335d030cd170f210474934c79e498f4b68d2c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,53,208,48,205,23,15,33,4,116,147,76,121,228,152,244,182,141,44,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
