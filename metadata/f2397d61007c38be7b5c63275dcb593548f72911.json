It has been extensively reorganized to eliminate redundancies in the earlier edition, and takes a broader, more pragmatic approach in its coverage of health behavior change.\n\nNew content includes chapters on lifestyle change and prevention and chronic disease management, with an intensive focus on specific behaviors (i.e. diet and nutrition, tobacco use) and chronic illness (i.e diabetes, heart disease). A new section on Community, System, and Provider Interventions to Support Health Behavior Change focuses on the efficacy of interventions implemented within various systems such as schools, workplaces, and health care systems. The fourth edition also provides learning objectives and discussion questions to facilitate use by course instructors in health psychology, behavioral medicine, and public health.\nThis multidisciplinary text has been authored and edited by highly esteemed practitioners, educators, and researchers who are experts in their specific areas of study.
