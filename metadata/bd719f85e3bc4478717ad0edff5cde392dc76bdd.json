It was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and produced by Andrew Loog Oldham. Richards' three-note guitar riff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ intended to be replaced by horns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ opens and drives the song. The lyrics refer to sexual frustration and commercialism.\n\nThe song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and also featured on the fourth studio album of American version of Out of Our Heads, released that July. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; was a hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the US. In the UK, the song initially played only on pirate radio stations because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive. In Britain, the single was released in August 1965; it became the Rolling Stones' fourth number one in the United Kingdom. The song is considered to be one of the all-time greatest rock songs ever recorded. In 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed &quot;Satisfaction&quot; in the second spot on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, while in 2006 it was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry.\n\nIn the decades since its release, &quot;Satisfaction&quot; has repeatedly been acclaimed by the music industry. In 1976, Britain's New Musical Express listed &quot;Satisfaction&quot; 7th among the top 100 singles of all time. There was a resurgence of interest in the song after it was prominently featured in the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now. In 1991, Vox listed &quot;Satisfaction&quot; among &quot;100 records that shook the world&quot;. In 1999, BMI named &quot;Satisfaction&quot; as the 91st-most performed song of the 20th century. In 2000, VH1 listed &quot;Satisfaction&quot; first among its &quot;Top 100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot;; the same year, &quot;Satisfaction&quot; also finished runner-up to &quot;Yesterday&quot; in a list jointly compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV. In 2003, Q placed the song 68th out of its &quot;1001 Best Songs Ever&quot;. In 2004, Rolling Stone's panel of judges named &quot;Satisfaction&quot; as the second-greatest song of all time, coming in second to Bob Dylan's &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Newsweek has called the opening riff &quot;five notes that shook the world&quot;.\n\n\nJagger said of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;:\n\n&quot;it was the song that really made the Rolling Stones, changed us from just another band into a huge, monster band... It has a very catchy title. It has a very catchy guitar riff. It has a great guitar sound, which was original at that time. And it captures a spirit of the times, which is very important in those kinds of songs... Which was alienation.&quot;\n\n\nThe Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. In the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US from 1964 ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ 65 and symbols of rebellious youth, the Rolling Stones were also instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the more primitive blues typified by John Lee Hooker and by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list and their estimated album sales are above 200 million. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Sticky Fingers (1971) was their first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the United States. In 2008 the Rolling Stones ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(I_Can't_Get_No)_Satisfaction&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(I_Can't_Get_No)_Satisfaction&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaIddAafc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaIddAafc&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8600kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:34\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
