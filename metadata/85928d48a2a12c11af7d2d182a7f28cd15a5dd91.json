He probably is the best stand-up I've ever heard, so if that's your art-form, you should listen. The radio shows have a great late-night radio exclusivity feel too.\n\nThis torrent is stuff I've found all over the place in the last couple of years without really looking too hard. Included:\n\nStand-up:\nCardiff Glee Club\nLive in Hull\nThe Edinburgh Podcast things\n\nRadio:\nOn Triple R\nListening Hour\n\nPlease feel free to just grab the stand-up stuff if you want to test whether you like him, Cardiff and Hull are best.\n\nAnd please seed to 1.0 because this torrent is only ever gonna have a handful of seeders.\n\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85928d48a2a12c11af7d2d182a7f28cd15a5dd91","amp;dn":"Daniel+Kitson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85928d48a2a12c11af7d2d182a7f28cd15a5dd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,146,141,72,162,161,44,17,175,125,45,24,42,127,40,205,21,165,221,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
