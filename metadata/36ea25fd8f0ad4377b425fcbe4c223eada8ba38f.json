Up two notches to number 19, here's the Alan Parsons Project and 'Don't Answer Me'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown (of which Baby George would approve):\n\n&quot;It's My Life&quot; by Talk Talk, debuts at number 40 as does &quot;Runaway&quot; by Bon Jovi (at number 39), &quot;Time After Time&quot; by Cyndi Lauper (at number 36), &quot;I'll Wait&quot; by Van Halen (at number 33) and &quot;Sister Christian&quot; by Night Ranger (at number 32).\n\nCasey tells whatever became of Motown Records' first successful solo artist, Mary Wells.\n\nA listener wants to know what number one song has had the longest title. Casey says this forty-letter titled song was about a small piece of clothing.\n\nI usually don't include personal stories but four days before this countdown aired, I had taken my first girlfriend to Kansas City, Missouri, to see Billy Joel while he was on his &quot;Innocent Man&quot; tour. She was my Uptown Girl, I was her Downtown Man. and Christie Brinkley was in the front row filming with her camcorder. Mr. Joel's hit, &quot;The Longest Time&quot; is at number 25.\n\nThe biggest mover in the countdown is &quot;Let's Hear It For The Boy&quot; by Deniece Williams (from number 38 to 23) and the biggest dropper is &quot;Radio Ga-Ga&quot; by Queen (from number 18 to 35).\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;In the rock era, how many songs from the movies have hit number one and then won the Oscar for best song?&quot; Casey lists the nine songs that did just that.\n\nCasey tells how &quot;Weird&quot; Al Yankovic (at number 15 with his song &quot;Eat It&quot;) earned his fame and made his own luck by sending his songs to the superintendent of silliness, Dr. Demento.\n\nLionel Richie is at number 3 with his song &quot;Hello&quot; so Casey lists three number one songs with &quot;Hello&quot; in the title: one by Satchmo, one by the Fab Four, and one by the band whose lead singer's anagram was &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin.&quot;\n\nThis is the week Michael Jackson's album &quot;Thriller&quot; fell from the number one spot for the last time after spending a total of 37 non-consecutive weeks at number 1 on the album chart.  It was pushed out of the number one spot five different times by different albums and Casey lists them all.\n\nLW#1: Footloose - Kenny Loggins\n40: It's My Life - Talk Talk\n39: Runaway - Bon Jovi\n38: Come Back And Stay - Paul Young\n37: Borderline - Madonna\n36: Time After Time - Cyndi Lauper\n35: Radio Ga-Ga - Queen\n34: Holding Out For A Hero - Bonnie Tyler\n33: I'll Wait - Van Halen\n32: Sister Christian - Night Ranger\n31: No More Words - Berlin\n30: Dancing In The Sheets - Shalamar\n29: Show Me - The Pretenders\nLDD: The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face - Roberta Flack\n28: A Fine Fine Day - Tony Carey\n27: Oh Sherrie - Steve Perry\n26: Breakdance - Irene Cara\n25: The Longest Time - Billy Joel\n24: Leave It - Yes\n23: Let's Hear It For The Boy - Deniece Williams\n22: Authority Song - John Cougar Mellencamp\n21: I Want A New Drug - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n20: Head Over Heels - Go-Go's\n19: Don't Answer Me - Alan Parsons Project\n18: Tonight - Kool &amp; The Gang\n17: Girls Just Want To Have Fun - Cyndi Lauper\n16: Girls - Dwight Twilley\n15: Eat It - &quot;Weird&quot; Al Yankovic\n14: Jump - Van Halen\n13: To All The Girls I've Known Before - Willie Nelson\n12: Adult Education - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n11: You Might Think - The Cars\n10: They Don't Know - Tracey Ullman\n9: Here Comes The Rain Again - Eurythmics\n8: Love Somebody - Rick Springfield\n7: Somebody's Watching Me - Rockwell\n6: Automatic - Pointer Sisters\nLDD: I Made It Through The Rain - Barry Manilow\n5: Miss Me Blind - Culture Club\n4: Hold Me Now - Thompson Twins\n3: Hello - Lionel Richie\n2: Footloose - Kenny Loggins\n1: Against All Odds - Phil Collins\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ea25fd8f0ad4377b425fcbe4c223eada8ba38f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1984_April_21st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ea25fd8f0ad4377b425fcbe4c223eada8ba38f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,234,37,253,143,10,212,55,123,66,95,203,228,194,35,234,218,139,163,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
