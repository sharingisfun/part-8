Includes liner notes by Michael Hill.\n\nReview from CDUniverse:\n\nGreatest Hits is a terrific compilation of 22 digitally remastered Henry Mancini favorites, including his soundtrack themes &quot;Peter Gunn,&quot; &quot;The Pink Panther Theme,&quot; &quot;Love Theme From Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Mr. Lucky,&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's,&quot; among many others. The collection also includes well-known Mancini tunes like &quot;Moon River,&quot; &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; &quot;Baby Elephant Walk,&quot; and &quot;Dear Heart&quot; to name a few. The sound is crystal clear and the track selection demonstrates over and over again Mancini's gifts for melody and mood. Overall, it's probably the best single-disc introduction to Mancini's work yet assembled. ~ Steve Huey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa81f6596647c0063e8146cfffa9b3c7f3b380cc","amp;dn":"Henry+Mancini+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29+flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa81f6596647c0063e8146cfffa9b3c7f3b380cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,129,246,89,102,71,192,6,62,129,70,207,255,169,179,199,243,179,128,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
