Knowing which choices to make is not teachable. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part of that creative instinct we call talent whose secret voice guides us every time we sit down at the keyboard. All stories are not identical. They are shaped by all those unique facets of the human beings who write them. All any writer can do when he wants to share his knowledge with others is be as open and giving as possible; and hope others can learn from that. You hold in your hands most of what I know about writing for games and much of what I believe and practice no matter what kind of writing IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m doing. It is meant to inform, to instruct, and maybe even inspire. It is as much about game design as it is writing for games. The two are virtually inseparable. The book itself has been designed as a quest. We are all of us on a journey toward a destination for which there is no single road.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cac2c0320165acad187b75e21ae2243f7a2374","amp;dn":"Character+Development+%26+Storytelling+For+Games+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cac2c0320165acad187b75e21ae2243f7a2374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,202,194,192,50,1,101,172,173,24,123,117,226,26,226,36,63,122,35,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
