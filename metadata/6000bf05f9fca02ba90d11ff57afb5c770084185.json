Al Kooper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he of the famed organ riff that propelled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Like a Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ recalled, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suddenly Dylan exploded through the doorway with this bizarre-looking guy carrying a Fender Telecaster guitar without a case. It was weird, because it was storming outside and the guitar was all wet from the rain. But the guy just shuffled over into the corner, wiped it off with a rag, plugged in, and commenced to play some of the most incredible guitar IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever heard. And he was just warming up!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nKooper recounts the whole story of his first encounter with Michael Bloomfield in his indispensable tome Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards. KooperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fateful introduction to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the man who can still make me pack up my guitar whenever his music is playedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ led to the seminal Super Session record in 1968 and further collaborations. Now, decades later, Kooper has produced and curated what may well be the definitive anthology dedicated to the music of Michael Bloomfield, the guitarist Bob Dylan recognized as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the best.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6000bf05f9fca02ba90d11ff57afb5c770084185","amp;dn":"Michael+Bloomfield+-+From+His+Head+to+His+Heart+to+His+Hands+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6000bf05f9fca02ba90d11ff57afb5c770084185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,0,191,5,249,252,160,43,169,13,17,255,87,175,181,199,112,8,65,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
