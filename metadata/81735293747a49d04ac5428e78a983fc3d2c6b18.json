As the series opens, Kate's father has just died, leaving his young widow Lauren in charge as Kate and the firm adjust to the loss.\n\nKate and Lauren, who are approximately the same age, generally engage in comical banter while attempting to work together, and the development of their relationship is a central focus of the series. According to Shahi, the characters &quot;take a couple steps forward and then take gigantic leaps back.&quot; She has also stated that their history divides them at certain times, and bonds them at others. &quot;At the end of the day, they would give the shirt off of their backs to help the other person, because they are family.\n\n\n\nCast: Sarah Shahi\n      Michael Trucco\n      Virginia Williams\n      Baron Vaughn\n      Ryan Johnson\n\n\nFile Types: Mkv aka Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nActual Screenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3531/vlcsnap2013052104h27m01.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/3531/vlcsnap2013052104h27m01.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7908/vlcsnap2013052104h29m16.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7908/vlcsnap2013052104h29m16.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5958/vlcsnap2013052104h33m20.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5958/vlcsnap2013052104h33m20.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/7320/vlcsnap2013052104h37m24.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img90.imageshack.us/img90/7320/vlcsnap2013052104h37m24.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2311/vlcsnap2013052104h38m14.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2311/vlcsnap2013052104h38m14.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6053/vlcsnap2013052104h42m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6053/vlcsnap2013052104h42m51.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.usanetwork.com/series/fairlylegal/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.usanetwork.com/series/fairlylegal/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1586676/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1586676/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairly_Legal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairly_Legal&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, KILLERS, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81735293747a49d04ac5428e78a983fc3d2c6b18","amp;dn":"Fairly+Legal+Season+2+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81735293747a49d04ac5428e78a983fc3d2c6b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,115,82,147,116,122,73,208,74,197,66,142,120,169,131,252,61,44,107,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
