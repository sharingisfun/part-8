This double CD continues in the same vein of the previous two, Scoop and Another Scoop, in providing a glimpse into Pete Townshend's artistic process. This set contains Pete's demo's of songs that were destined for either The Who, his own solo projects and those that didn't make either. \n\nIn the liner notes Pete writes &quot;In this collection of new and old recordings we have broken with tradition a little. I offered my editor and producer Helen a lot more recent material than usual. It was mainly instrumental. Listeners who are visitors to my website will be familiar now with the experimental piano writing on which I began to concentrate after a cycling accident in 1991. So the recent instrumental tracks are peppered mainly with various song demos from the fertile days when I had to write songs for The Who AND myself.&quot; Scoop 3 includes notes by Pete Townshend explaining the background to each song.\n\nSCOOP 3 [320k MP3]\n\n\nDisc 1:\n\n  1.
