He was the vocalist of the rock group Bauhaus, and later went on to release a number of solo albums, such as Deep and Love Hysteria. Thin, with prominent cheekbones, a baritone voice, and a penchant for gloomy poetics, Murphy is often called the &quot;Godfather of Goth.&quot;\n\nMurphy was born near Northampton, England, and raised in Wellingborough, England. Bauhaus were one of the establishing acts of the goth movement.[citation needed] Their use of spacey recording effects and theatrical aesthetics was evocative of glam rock; they became an influential group in the early days of gothic rock.[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:458681583c6b112b6802344d8fbcc0cee3a4eec3","amp;dn":"Peter+Murphy+-+8+Albums+1986+-+2011+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"458681583c6b112b6802344d8fbcc0cee3a4eec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,134,129,88,60,107,17,43,104,2,52,77,143,188,192,206,227,164,238,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
