The Best of KC &amp; the Sunshine Band covers the high points of the band's production team of keyboardist/vocalist Harry Wayne &quot;K.C.&quot; Casey and quirky bassist Richard Finch. \nThe earliest tracks, &quot;Queen of Clubs&quot; and &quot;Sound Your Funky Horn,&quot; are good but not great glossy, heavily produced R&amp;B. The list of hits here is impressive whether looking from a straight-up R&amp;B standpoint or early R&amp;B-based disco. &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot; and &quot;That's the Way I Like It,&quot; in fact, are the perfect examples of what happened in dance-based music. \nTracks from the band's best album, Part 3, rightfully get a lot of slots here. Essential offerings like &quot;I'm Your Boogie Man,&quot; &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me,&quot; &quot;I Like to Do It,&quot; and &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot; display the band as a tireless polyrhythmic machine. The brilliant &quot;Keep It Comin' Love&quot; arguably bests them all. This best-of also includes later tracks, including the raucous and flashy &quot;Do You Wanna Go Party&quot; and the sweeping ballad &quot;Please Don't Go.&quot; \nAlthough this best-of is more thorough than most, fans might notice a few omissions. &quot;I Get Lifted&quot; and their so-bad-it's-good cover of the Four Tops' classic &quot;It's the Same Old Song&quot; didn't make the cut. \nThe Best of KC &amp; the Sunshine Band is an excellent overview and proves that the band was indeed closer to R&amp;B than they ever were to disco.
