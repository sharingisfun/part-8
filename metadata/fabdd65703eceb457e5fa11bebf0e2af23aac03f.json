Researchers have also begun to develop a better understanding of the cellular environment needed for optimal tissue repair and regeneration. Biomaterials and Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine explores a range of applications for biomaterials and stem cell therapy and describes recent research on suitable cell scaffolds and substrates for tissue repair and reconstruction.\n\nFeaturing contributions by experts in the field, the book explores important scientific and clinical aspects. It covers the basic science involved in structure and properties, techniques and technological innovations in processing and characterization, and applications of biomaterials and stem cells.\n\nTopics include:\n-    Polymeric systems for stem cell delivery\n-    The potential of membranes and porous scaffolds in tissue repair, including myocardial, periodontal, ophthalmic, and bone tissues\n-    The optimization of the interaction between stem cells and biomaterial substrates\n-    The source and nature of stem cells for tissue engineering applications\n-    The clinical translation of stem cellÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased tissue engineering for regenerative medicine\n\nFrom fundamental principles to recent advances at the macro, micro, nano, and molecular scales, the book brings together current knowledge on biomaterials and stem cells in the context of regenerative medicine. It also stimulates discussion about future research directions.\n\nThis unique book offers a valuable benchmark for the current status of clinically relevant research and development in stem cells and regenerative medicine. It bridges the gaps in experimental approaches and understanding among the materials science and engineering, biological sciences, and biomedical science and engineering communities, making it a valuable reference for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners working in the multidisciplinary field of biomedical research.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMurugan Ramalingam is an associate professor of biomaterials and tissue engineering at the Institut National de la SantÃƒÂ© et de la Recherche MÃƒÂ©dicale U977, FacultÃƒÂ© de Chirurgie Dentaire, University of Strasbourg (UdS), France.
