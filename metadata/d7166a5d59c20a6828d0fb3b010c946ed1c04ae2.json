Are pesticides safe? Should we choose locally grown food? Why do some people embrace new agricultural technologies while others steadfastly defend traditional farming methods? In the debates about organic food, genetically modified organisms, and farm animal welfare, it's not always clear what the scientific studies are actually telling us.\n\nTo understand these controversies and more, the authors of Agricultural and Food Controversies: What Everyone Needs to Know begin by encouraging readers to develop an understanding of how two well-educated people can form radically different opinions about food. Sometimes the disputes are scientific in nature, and sometimes they arise from conflicting ethical views. This book confronts the most controversial issues in agriculture by first explaining the principles of each side of the debate, guiding readers through the scientific literature so that they can form their own educated opinions. \n\nQuestions asked:\n- Are organic foods truly better for your health? \n- Are chemical fertilizers sustainable, or are we producing cheap food at the expense of future generations? \n- What foods should we eat to have a smaller carbon footprint?\n- Does buying local food stimulate the local economy? \n- Why are so many farm animals raised indoors? \n- Should antibiotics be given to livestock? \n- Is genetically-modified food the key to global food security, and does it give corporations too much market power? \n- Is the prevalence of corn throughout the food system the result of farm subsidies? \n\nProviding a combination of research and popular opinions on both sides of the issue, Agricultural and Food Controversies: What Everyone Needs to Know allows readers to decide for themselves what they personally value and believe to be important when it comes to their food.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: What Everyone Needs to Know\nPDF: 169 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press (December 5, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0199368422\nISBN-13: 978-0199368426\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7166a5d59c20a6828d0fb3b010c946ed1c04ae2","amp;dn":"Agricultural+and+Food+Controversies%3A+What+Everyone+Needs+to+Know","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7166a5d59c20a6828d0fb3b010c946ed1c04ae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,22,106,93,89,194,10,104,40,208,251,59,1,12,148,110,209,192,74,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
