A few things have come up, and unfortunately I haven't been able to devote nearly as much time to this as I usually do.  So, at 6 gigabytes, today's 61st bundle represents the largest single bundle I have shared so far.  It also brings us up top date.  And because it's going to take me a while longer than usual to fully seed this, I hope some of you will stick around a little longer than perhaps you might otherwise, so we can get this thing to 100% together.\n\nGOSPEL: 3 Winans Brothers, Dorothy Norwood, G Mayes And NE, Gaither Vocal Band, Javis Mays.
