The first of which she held at the age of five. She started to studying music at the age of nine, she graduated from the economics management department at Damascus University in 2002. while she was studying at the higher institution of music in Damascus , she graduated as a classical vocalist in 2007. \nThroughout her university education, she joined many workshops in the field of classic music with Gloria Skalki (Italy ) Karmen Filarna ( Italy ) Mia bits ( Netherlands ). \nShe also joined Jazz workshops, most importantly, with the German Accordionist ( Manfred leuschter ).this resulted in lena and Manfred featured on each others albums and many concerts in Syria and Germany . She also worked with many vocalists and musicians of different nationalities in many jazz festivals in Syria. \nThe idea of the project was born before Lena started to study music academically. Classic was mixed with oriental jazz and Armenian music to reflect the unique essence of Lena's style as a vocalist. She was charmed from the very beginning by the idea of mixing simple oriental tunes with cords. Many friend from the high institution of music helped Lena understand and conceptualize the project the first of whom was Basel Rajoub who arranged the music and managed the progect. \nThey together won the middle east first award presented by radio Monte Carlo in 2006 for ( Hal Asmarellon ) album that was produced by the means of the grant given to him by \n( almawred althakafi ) institution ( Egypt ) . This helped to enrich the artistic abilities reflected on their second step of the project , the album ( Shamat ). \nThe thesis being reflected in the steps of the project can be explained in two points: \nfirst of all , it's an attempt to revive folkloric songs , especially Syrian ones , in a modern style and arrangement keeping the originality of the tunes and the lyrics in order to create a link between () monotonous oriental classic music and contemporary world music that has a harmonic accompany and different musical styles and instruments that contribute to enriching the tune and to activate the beauty of its genre which helps world cultural contact by forming a specific unique language especially outside the Arab world . \nthe second point is to introduce origenal compositions allowing a more free space of tunes and lyrics as in ( Sha'am ) and ( magic) from ( Shamat ) album . Composition will get more focus in the next albums.\n\nTrackList:\n\nAwal Mousafer (Ã˜Â£Ã™Ë†Ã™â€ž Ã™â€¦Ã˜Â³Ã˜Â§Ã™ï¿½Ã˜Â± (06:20 \nYa Hali 1 (Ã™Å Ã˜Â§ Ã™â€¡Ã™â€žÃ™Å  1 (05:46 \nOror (Yalla Tnam) (Ã™Å Ã™â€žÃ˜Â§ Ã˜ÂªÃ™â€ Ã˜Â§Ã™â€¦ (02:40 \nShehrazad (Ã˜Â´Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â²Ã˜Â§Ã˜Â¯ (05:36 \nAkher Elaan'oud (Ã˜Â¢Ã˜Â®Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¹Ã™â€ Ã™â€šÃ™Ë†Ã˜Â¯ (04:46 \nGhazl el banat (Ã˜ÂºÃ˜Â²Ã™â€ž Ã˜Â§Ã™â€žÃ˜Â¨Ã™â€ Ã˜Â§Ã˜Âª (03:56 \nManfa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Exile (Ã™â€¦Ã™â€ Ã™ï¿½Ã™â€° (05:28 \nDiramayren (03:59) \nHenna w Zahr Intro (Ã˜Â­Ã™â€ Ã™â€˜Ã˜Â© Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â²Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â± (01:24 \nHenna w Zahr (Ã˜Â­Ã™â€ Ã™â€˜Ã˜Â© Ã™Ë†Ã˜Â²Ã™â€¡Ã˜Â± (06:18 \nYa Hali 2 (Ã™Å Ã˜Â§ Ã™â€¡Ã™â€žÃ™Å  2 (04:37 \nGher shi (Ã˜ÂºÃ™Å Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â´Ã™Å  (02:14 \n\nDuration : 53:00 | Bitrate : 320 Kbit/s | Year : 2013 | Size : 122 mb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9593e2a77ee1e4adb13d6734827bc93cfd40ef","amp;dn":"Lena+Chamamyan+-+2013+-+Ghazl+El+Banat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9593e2a77ee1e4adb13d6734827bc93cfd40ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,149,147,226,167,126,225,228,173,177,61,103,52,130,123,201,60,253,64,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
