Here the officers defied the two principles of guerrilla warfare: never concentrate your forces or risk a pitched battle. They assembled small armies of untrained civilians in wild country where it was believed Allied airborne forces would land and help them drive the hated occupiers out of their country. In reality they were being used as baitÃ¢â‚¬â€to draw German forces away from the invasion beaches. They were hunted down by collaborationist French paramilitaries, Wehrmacht, and Waffen-SS troops, dying in the snows of winter through to high midsummer. Those taken prisoner were raped, tortured, and shot or deported to death camps in Germany. Many of their killers were themselves murdered after the liberation, when thousands of Frenchwomen were also publicly humiliated as sexual traitors.\n\nAbout the Author\nDouglas Boyd has lived in France for more than 30 years and personally interviewed hundreds of survivors of the German occupation. His books, which include April Queen and French Foreign Legion have been translated into 17 languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f43e3e5cda50a6b26fa4c6d6721c5099e672ac8b","amp;dn":"Blood+In+The+Snow%2C+Blood+On+The+Grass+Treachery%2C+Torture%2C+Murder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f43e3e5cda50a6b26fa4c6d6721c5099e672ac8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,62,62,92,218,80,166,178,111,164,198,214,114,28,80,153,230,114,172,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
