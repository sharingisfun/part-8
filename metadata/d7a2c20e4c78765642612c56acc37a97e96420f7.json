If You&amp;#039;re Going Through Hell    3:37\n    (Before The Devil Even Knows)\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nCurb recording artist Rodney Atkins has another smash single on his\nhands as &quot;If You&amp;#039;re Going Through Hell (Before The Devil Even Knows)&quot;\nclimbs into the top 10 on the R&amp;R and Billboard singles charts. The\nmusic video for the single is also in rotation on CMT and GAC.\n\nThe song is the first single and title track from Atkins&amp;#039; second Curb\nalbum, due in stores on July 18. For the East Tennessee born and bred\nsinger/songwriter, the new album is closer to home than his first\nrelease.\n\n&quot;We found plenty of great songs for my last album but not all of them\nmatched me,&quot; Atkins says. &quot;Now we&amp;#039;re thinking differently. When I\nheard this song I loved it. It makes such a powerful statement.&quot;\n\nAs does the album that shares the song&amp;#039;s name. While his 2003 release\nHonesty included a top 5 smash in the title track, If You&amp;#039;re Going\nThrough Hell is a much better representation of who Atkins&amp;#039; is and\nwhere he fits in the country landscape.\n\nSongs like &quot;These Are My People,&quot; &quot;About The South&quot; and &quot;A Man On A\nTractor&quot; reveal the simple, rural truths Atkins grew up with and\nseeks to carry on through his own family...and his music. &quot;Every song\nI sing is about the world as I know it. Every word is real. I&amp;#039;m not\ngoing to sing it if it isn&amp;#039;t.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7a2c20e4c78765642612c56acc37a97e96420f7","amp;dn":"Rodney+Atkins+-+If+You%5C%27re+Going+Through+Hell+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7a2c20e4c78765642612c56acc37a97e96420f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,162,194,14,76,120,118,86,66,97,44,86,172,195,122,151,233,100,32,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
