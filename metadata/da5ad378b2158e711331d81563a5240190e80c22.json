In his post, as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, he counts Isaac Newton amongst his predecessors. And he was born 300 years to the day after the avant-garde astronomer, Galileo Galilei.\n\nFollowing a devastating diagnosis of motor neurone disease in 1963, he daily defies medical science. The disease is generally a killer that is characterised by muscle wasting and paralysis. Hawking was given two years to live at the time, yet 44 years later he is still going strong and hoping to solve the big problem of physics.\n\nHawking, with a zest for life and work that few of us can equal, has already made major contributions to his field. But with only one cheek muscle now working, will he manage his true aspiration, to solve the theory of everything?\n\n\n\nEpisode one: Hawking so Far\n---------------------------\n \nIn 1963, 21-year-old Stephen Hawking was a promising PhD student with everything to live for. His life was shattered by the devastating news that he had motor neurone disease and probably had at most two years to live. Whilst the blow stunned him, it also sharpened his ambition and fixed his determination on the biggest questions in the universe.\n\n\nEpisode two: The Future \n-----------------------\n\nIn 1988, Stephen Hawking promised that he and his colleagues would soon answer the big question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how did the Big Bang happen? Twenty years on and this is still the hot potato of physics. The answer requires that the two major theoretical bases of physics are brought into cohesion. These are the physics of the very tiny (quantum theory) and the physics of the very large (Einstein's relativity).\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by:  Julian Rhind-Tutt\n-------------------------------\n\n\nDirected &amp; Produced by: Gary Johnstone\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Master Of The Universe-Stephen Hawking\nYear:  2008\nFile Size: (348 MB Episode I)+(349 MB Episode II)   \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: (00:48:10)+(00:48:10) \nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 640x352 \nVIdeo Bitrate: (Episode I 987 kbit/s)+(Episode II 991 kbit/s)\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\nParts: Episode I &amp; Episode II \n\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: I have reached the totaly ammount of bandwidth at my regular image \n-------------\n              site.
