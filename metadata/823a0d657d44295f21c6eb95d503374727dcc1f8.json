The following February Steve Smith, a writer for the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, wrote an article titled &quot;Could Klaatu Be the Beatles? Mystery Is a Magical Mystery Tour.&quot; The article began the rumor that Klaatu was &quot;more than likely either in part or in whole the Beatles.&quot; These conjectures, fueled by a series of articles in trade magazines like Billboard created a huge amount of hype and Capitol did nothing to deny or confirm the rumors. Throughout 1977, record sales soared and radio stations ran &quot;Is Klaatu the Beatles?&quot; promotions. Reportedly, some of the &quot;clues&quot; as to whether or not Klaatu were the Beatles included backward messages, Morse code, references to the group's identities in the song lyrics, and the word &quot;Beatles&quot; hidden in various places on the record jacket. After several months of conjecture, the group's identity was revealed at the end of year -- it wasn't the Beatles after all, it was Terry Draper (songwriter, vocalist, drummer), John Woloschuck, and Dee Long. Immediately, their record sales declined, and due to a backlash generated by the Beatles hoax their four subsequent albums failed to sell. The group broke up in 1981.\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tBullseye Records\nCatalog:\t\tBLR-CD-2515\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Hanus Of Uranus\n02.Sub Rosa Subway\n03.Cherie\n04.Doctor Marvello\n05.For You Girl\n06.California Jam\n07.True Life Hero\n08.Calling Occupants (Of Interplanetary Craft)\n09.Sir Bodsworth Rugglesby III\n10.Little Neutrino\n11.We're Off You Know\n12.Around The Universe In 80 Days\n13.Madman\n14.Long Live Politzania\n15.The Lonliest Of Creatures\n16.Prelude\n17.So Said The Lighthouse Keeper\n18.Epilogue\n19.Hope\n\nCD2\n\n01.A Routine Day\n02.Juicy Luicy\n03.Everybody Took A Holiday\n04.Older\n05.Dear Christine\n06.Mister Manson\n07.Tokeymor Field\n08.Sir Rupert Said...\n09.Sell Out, Sell Out\n10.Howl At The Moon\n11.I Can't Help It\n12.Paranoia\n13.Set The World On Fire\n14.Dog Star\n15.All Good Things\n16.There's Something Happening\n17.I Don't Wanna Go Home\n18.At The End Of The Rainbow\n19.December Dream\n20.Mrs. Toad's Cookies\n21.Magentalane\n22.Ambrose Lightship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:823a0d657d44295f21c6eb95d503374727dcc1f8","amp;dn":"Klaatu+-+Sun+Set+1973-1981+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"823a0d657d44295f21c6eb95d503374727dcc1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,58,13,101,125,68,41,95,33,198,235,149,213,3,55,71,39,220,193,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
