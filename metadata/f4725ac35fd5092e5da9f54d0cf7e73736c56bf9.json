The narrator changes from a smart-aleck to someone trying to find a vein to inject, while Candy changes from an actress, call girl, streetwalker, and then a madwoman. Starting in Sydney, the two eventually end up in Melbourne to go clean, but they fail. This leads them to turn to finding money and heroin, while other posessions and attachments become unimportant.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4725ac35fd5092e5da9f54d0cf7e73736c56bf9","amp;dn":"Candy%5B2006%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4725ac35fd5092e5da9f54d0cf7e73736c56bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,114,90,195,95,213,9,46,93,169,245,77,12,247,231,55,54,197,107,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
