Forty years after its release in 1971, Elvis Country, an LP that found him getting back in touch with the Nashville country music mainstream, is the lynchpin for Elvis Country: Legacy Edition, the newest entry in the series. Included in the new package on CD one is the original 12-song Elvis Country (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m 10,000 Years OldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), first released in 1971. Three bonus tracks are drawn from the original recording sessions of June and September 1970. On CD two, from the June sessions, comes the original 11-song Love Letters From Elvis also with three bonus tracks from the original sessions.\n\nThis new 2-CD Legacy Edition features both these classic original albums and 6 bonus tracks including the full version of &quot;I Was Born About Ten Thousand Years Ago,&quot; the studio jam &quot;A Hundred Years From Now&quot; and the single &quot;Where Did They Go, Lord&quot; c/w &quot;Rags To Riches&quot; which reached #33 on the Billboard chart.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc One\n\nElvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old) - Original Album\n01.
