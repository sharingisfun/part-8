Baden Powell belongs to the small circle of guitarists whose early virtuosity is perfectly combined with a keen sense of harmony. Powell demonstrates this special talent in his slow numbers in particular, in which broken chords are developed like a bud opening out to a blossom. He guides the listener cautiously through his melodies in that he makes a tiny pause before a harmonic change. Full timbre and lightness are not a question of what is written down on the manuscript but result from a powerful performance, as is shown by the totally un-Brazilian, gentle major-minor key version of the childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song &quot;Kommt Ein Vogel Geflogen&quot;.\n\nNaturally, the wonderfully crafted, animated and bouncy bossas flow along easily. As befits the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title, the guitar is in the limelight here, driven on, held back, and then propelled forward by the rhythm group. The ballad &quot;Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Voce&quot; is strongly recommended to whet your appetite for the bossa &quot;Na Gafieira Do Vidigal&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980c3223c4959ab794b10a06adea82cd9f9cccbf","amp;dn":"Baden+Powell+-+Solitude+on+Guitar+%5B1973%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980c3223c4959ab794b10a06adea82cd9f9cccbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,12,50,35,196,149,154,183,148,177,10,6,173,234,130,205,159,156,204,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
