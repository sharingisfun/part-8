I haven't really found this anywhere else, so I thought i'd give you Ed-Heads a treat. This is a simple guitar lesson from the master himself, and a transcription of Eruption by Steve Vai. Enjoy!\n\nScanned by my guitar teacher.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33332534ae1eff84aeca0fe63a48b0df6703a0a9","amp;dn":"Super+Rare+1984+Eddie+Van+Halen+Guitar+Lesson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33332534ae1eff84aeca0fe63a48b0df6703a0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,51,37,52,174,30,255,132,174,202,15,230,58,72,176,223,103,3,160,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
