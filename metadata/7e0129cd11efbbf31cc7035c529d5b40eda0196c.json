And they stand up remarkably well. LewisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light, bluesy touch is balanced by Milt JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulful vibes, Percy Heath is one of the great jazz bass players, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grit beneath the surface.\n(Mike Hobart)\n\n- - -\n\nModern Jazz Quartet - Original Album Series 1960-1964\n(5CD Warner 2012)\n\nCD1  Pyramid 1960\nCD2  Third Stream Music 1960\nCD3  The Modern Jazz Quartet and Orchestra 1960\nCD4  Lonely Woman 1962\nCD5  Sheriff 1964\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0129cd11efbbf31cc7035c529d5b40eda0196c","amp;dn":"Modern+Jazz+Quartet+-+Original+Album+Series+-+5CD-BOX+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0129cd11efbbf31cc7035c529d5b40eda0196c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,1,41,205,17,239,187,243,28,199,3,92,82,157,91,64,237,160,25,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
