Thereâ€™s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who canâ€™t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifiÂ­cial blood he pours on his â€œprayer log.â€ Thereâ€™s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial killÂ­ers, who troll Americaâ€™s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. Thereâ€™s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotteâ€™s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right.\r\n\r\nDonald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: M4B\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f277434929e5de0a9a0051d45f78f9006927944b","amp;dn":"Donald+Ray+Pollock+-+The+Devil+All+the+Time","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f277434929e5de0a9a0051d45f78f9006927944b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,119,67,73,41,229,222,10,154,0,81,212,95,120,249,0,105,39,148,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
