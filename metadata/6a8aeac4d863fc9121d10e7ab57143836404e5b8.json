The brilliant SGT. PEPPER satire of the cover should have garnered extra sales, but no. Zappa's scathing wit homed in on modern middle-class America and West Coast hippies. \n\nThe album offered 19 vignettes incorporating avant garde, doo-wop, some relatively conventional pop music and a lot of hilarious dialogue that was so hip it has never dated. Zappa made us confront the obvious, and the results were alarming. These issues are best demonstrated on &quot;What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body,&quot; &quot;Bow Tie Daddy,&quot; and &quot;The Idiot Bastard Son.&quot;\n\nRecorded between August and October, 1967.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
