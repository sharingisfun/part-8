There,\nno doubt, the bow was used to its greatest perfection,\nand it decided the fate of nations. The\ncrossbow and the matchlock had supplanted\nthe longbow when Columbus sailed for the New\nWorld.\nIt was, therefore, a distinct surprise to the\nfirst explorers of America that the natives used\nthe bow and arrow so effectively. In fact, the\nsword and the horse, combined with the white\nman?s superlative self-assurance, won the contest\nover the aborigines more than the primitive\nblunderbuss of the times. The bow and arrow\nwas still more deadly than the gun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1671c1dc49d3adb2e5d01e621fb671268da732","amp;dn":"HUNTING+WITH+THE+BOW+AND+ARROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1671c1dc49d3adb2e5d01e621fb671268da732","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,22,113,193,220,73,211,173,178,229,208,30,98,31,182,113,38,141,167,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
