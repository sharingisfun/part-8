After debacles against the T-34, Hitler and the Panzerwaffe were determined not to be unprepared again. The result of this determination was the production of the heaviest and largest tank to see combat during World War II, the Tiger II or Konigstiger (Kingtiger). This title examines this formidable weapon, covering the problems and controversies surrounding its design and production as well as a detailed listing of every unit that was equipped with the Tiger II","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f060c694ca2ec8551dfdc32f6bd45d2ccb073b1","amp;dn":"Kingtiger+Heavy+Tank+1942-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f060c694ca2ec8551dfdc32f6bd45d2ccb073b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,6,12,105,76,162,236,133,81,223,220,50,246,189,69,210,204,176,115,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
