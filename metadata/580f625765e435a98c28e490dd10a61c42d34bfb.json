They are frequently joined by fellow childhood friend Cappadonna, a quasi member of the group. They were formed in (and are associated with) the New York City borough of Staten Island (referred to by members as &quot;Shaolin&quot;), though some of their members are from Brooklyn and one is from The Bronx. They have introduced and launched the careers of affiliated artists and groups, often collectively known as the Wu-Tang Killa Bees, and in 2008, About.com ranked them the #1 greatest hip hop group of all time, and stated &quot;No weapon in hip-hop history can rival the chaotic cohesion of the Wu-Tang Clan. The Clan had so many characters, each with his own eccentricities. They were fearless in their approach. There's a good reason no group has been able to successfully recreate their sound. The crew spawned countless loosely associated acts. Their classic albums spawned classic albums.&quot; Kris Ex of Rolling Stone called Wu-Tang Clan &quot;the best rap group ever.&quot;\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3794/wutangclanenterthewutany.jpgh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3794/wutangclanenterthewutany.jpgh&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
