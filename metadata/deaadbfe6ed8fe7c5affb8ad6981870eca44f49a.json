Progress is illustrated with the birth and growth of a dragon for each new chapter.\nDr. Patrick Marchal, Ph.D. in cognitive science, and Jean-Baptiste Huynh, a high school teacher, created DragonBox Algebra 12+ as an intuitive, interative and efficient way to learn algebra.\n\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ is based on a novel pedagogical method developed in Norway that focuses on discovery and experimentation. Players receive instant feedback which differs from the traditional classroom setting where students can wait weeks for feedback. DragonBox Algebra 12+ creates an environment for kids where they can learn, enjoy and appreciate math.\n\nOur previous educational game, DragonBox Algebra 5+ has received many distinctions including the Gold Medal of the 2012 Serious Play Award (USA), the Best Serious game at BilbaoÃ‚Â´s Fun and Serious Game Festival and the Best Serious Game at the 2013 International Mobile Gaming Awards. It is also recommended by Common Sense Media where it won the Learn ON award.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* 20 progressive chapters (10 learning, 10 training) \n* 357 puzzles \n* Basic algebraic rules with which the child can experiment\n* A focus on minimal instruction encourages creativity and experimentation from the player \n* Multiple profiles for easy progress control \n* Dedicated graphics and music for each chapter \n* Multiple supported languages (English, franÃƒÂ§ais, norsk, svenska, dansk, espaÃƒÂ±ol, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´, italiano, portuguÃƒÂªs, Deutsch, Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹, Ã§Â®â‚¬Ã¤Â½â€œÃ¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡, Ã§Â¹ï¿½Ã©Â«â€Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡, suomi, Nederlands, Eesti, Euskara, TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ§e...)\n\nWhat's New:\n\nBug fix and translations.
