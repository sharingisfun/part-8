Each book had a sub-name, for lack of a better term, and it was actually that sub-name that ran on the cover. Issue number eight of Mr. Monster's Super Duper Special was called Mr. Monsters Weird Tales Of The Future No. 1 Why they gave them two different numbers... who knows why? Honestly, this guys books kind of became a mess after his death. It would be nice if somebody did a massive omnibus collection (or two) of his work. For now we've at least got the ongoing life-story books that Fantagraphics are printing, of which the first volume is absolutely stellar.  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMr. Monsters Weird Tales Of The Future No. 1 (or, Mr. Monster's Super Duper Special No. 8)\n\nEclipse Comics, 1987, 32 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Basil Wolverton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fe905625da2e8e2df3b6e848114e5b0cf9a4c4","amp;dn":"Basil+Wolverton+-+Mr.+Monsters+Weird+Tales+Of+The+Future","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fe905625da2e8e2df3b6e848114e5b0cf9a4c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,254,144,86,37,218,46,142,45,243,182,232,72,17,78,91,12,249,164,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
