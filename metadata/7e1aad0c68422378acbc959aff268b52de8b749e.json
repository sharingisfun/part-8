One performance in particular in Pomona, CA (at The Glasshouse) was filmed and recorded and will be released in a live DVD format. With no bad blood and everything firing on all fronts, it's hard to tell what will come next for Finch, but one thing remains certain: all eyes are watching to find out. \n\n\n1. New Beginnings\n2.
