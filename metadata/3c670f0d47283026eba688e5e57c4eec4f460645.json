My problem is over since I got Green for Life. Making smoothies is a great alternative to juicing. It is much faster, less messy, and you also get some fiber in addition to juice. In addition to great recipes for making smoothies the book is also a good source of information about proper nutrition, the importance of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and much more. Get this book!! Another great volume that you may not miss is Can We Live 150. These two books together make a perfect gift of showing the way to healthy living just for anyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c670f0d47283026eba688e5e57c4eec4f460645","amp;dn":"Green+for+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c670f0d47283026eba688e5e57c4eec4f460645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,103,15,13,71,40,48,38,235,166,136,229,229,124,78,236,79,70,6,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
