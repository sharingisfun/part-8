With such an unprecedented mix of rock, funk, jazz, hip-hop and soul, he had to create his own name to describe his signature sound: Supafunkrock! This album finds him collaborating with famed producer Raphael Saadiq. Recorded in Los Angeles and his native New Orleans, the album includes nine new original tracks and collaboration with the original line-up of the Meters, recording together for the first time since they broke up in 1977 on a new version of their song, 'Be My Lady'. \n\nTracklist: \n\n01 Say That To Say This 2:56\n02 You And I (Outta This Place) 3:51 \n03 Get The Picture\t 2:43\n04 Vieux Carre 2:45\n05 Be My Lady 3:31 \n06 Long Weekend 4:07 \n07 Fire And Brimstone 3:26 \n08 Sunrise 3:16 \n09 Dream On 4:20 \n10 Shortyville 4:22","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3aef5a303503e71f4b4b451aed30adc48a18baf","amp;dn":"Trombone+Shorty-+%282013%29+Say+that+to+say+this++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3aef5a303503e71f4b4b451aed30adc48a18baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,174,245,163,3,80,62,113,244,180,180,81,174,211,10,220,72,161,139,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
