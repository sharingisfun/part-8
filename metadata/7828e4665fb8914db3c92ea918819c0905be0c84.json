Reflecting both academic and in-the-trenches practical experience, the authors teach you how to describe objects and their positions, orientations, and trajectories in 3D using mathematics. The text provides an introduction to mathematics for game designers, including the fundamentals of coordinate spaces, vectors, and matrices. It also covers orientation in three dimensions, calculus and dynamics, graphics, and parametric curves. \n\nAbout the Authors\nFletcher Dunn has been programming video games professionally since 1996. He served as principle programmer at Terminal Reality in Dallas, where he was one of the architects of the Infernal engine and lead programmer on BloodRayne. He was a technical director for the Walt Disney Company at Wideload Games in Chicago, where he was the lead programmer for Disney Guilty Party, which won IGN's Family Game of the Year at E3 2010. He is currently a developer at Valve Software in Bellevue, Washington.\nIan Parberry is a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of North Texas. Dr. Parberry has more than a quarter century of experience in research and teaching and is nationally known as one of the pioneers of game programming in higher education.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgments xiii\nIntroduction xv\n1 Cartesian Coordinate Systems 1\n2 Vectors 31\n3 Multiple Coordinate Spaces 79\n4 Introduction to Matrices 113\n5 Matrices and Linear Transformations 137\n6 More on Matrices 161\n7 Polar Coordinate Systems 191\n8 Rotation in Three Dimensions 217\n9 Geometric Primitives 295\n10 Mathematical Topics from 3D Graphics 343\n11 Mechanics 1: Linear Kinematics and Calculus 479\n12 Mechanics 2: Linear and Rotational Dynamics 553\n13 Curves in 3D 645\n14 Afterword 715\nA Geometric Tests 717\nB Answers to the Exercises 745\nBibliography 801\nIndex 807","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7828e4665fb8914db3c92ea918819c0905be0c84","amp;dn":"3D+Math+Primer+for+Graphics+and+Game+Development+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7828e4665fb8914db3c92ea918819c0905be0c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,40,228,102,95,184,145,77,179,201,46,169,24,129,156,9,5,190,12,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
