Having kept a low profile for the past year, he is ready to return to work and he's more brutal, cunning, and dangerous than ever.\n\nNEW THREATS...\nScarred from their past battles, Special Agent Marcus Williams cannot shake Ackerman from his mind. But now Marcus must focus on catching the Anarchist, a new killer who drugs and kidnaps women before burning them alive.\n\nHIDDEN TERRORS...\nMarcus knows the Anarchist will strike again soon. And Ackerman is still free. But worse than this is a mysterious figure, unknown to the authorities, who controls the actions of the Anarchist and many like him. He is the Prophet and his plans are more terrible than even his own disciples can imagine.\n\nWith attacks coming from every side, Marcus faces a race against time to save the lives of a group of innocent people chosen as sacrifices in the Prophet's final dark ritual.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5779b7e6bc731a4c2de27d88a24fc34c19c6b2ef","amp;dn":"The+Prophet+by+Ethan+Cross+-+A+Shepherd+Thriller+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5779b7e6bc731a4c2de27d88a24fc34c19c6b2ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,121,183,230,188,115,26,76,45,226,125,136,162,79,195,76,25,198,178,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
