They began recording during the mid-1980s, and released their first album, Play Deep in 1985. The album went triple platinum in America. The Outfield are unique for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the US, but never reached the album or singles charts in their homeland. They continued to record into the early 1990s, before a hiatus during the middle of that decade. They resumed touring in 1998, and thereafter released two live albums via their web site. The band&amp;#039;s latest album, Any Time Now, was released by Sidewinder Records in March, 2006.\n\n&quot;Your Love&quot; is a song from The Outfield&amp;#039;s debut album, Play Deep. It was written by John Frederick Spinks. The song reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1986.\n\n&quot;Your Love&quot; was featured on the soundtrack for Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, a popular video game, playing on Pop station Flash FM.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b10f7317b25c7eae6115be4274a77cdf2527700","amp;dn":"The+Outfield+-+Your+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b10f7317b25c7eae6115be4274a77cdf2527700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,16,247,49,123,37,199,234,230,17,91,228,39,74,119,205,242,82,119,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
