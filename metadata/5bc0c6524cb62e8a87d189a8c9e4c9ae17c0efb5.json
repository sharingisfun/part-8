Early issues of Weirdo reflect Crumb's interests at the time - outsider art, fumetti, Church of the SubGenius-type anti-propaganda and assorted 'weirdness'. It also introduced artists such as Peter Bagge, Dori Seda and Dennis (Stickboy) Worden.\n\nWith issue 10, Crumb handed over the editing reins to Bagge. With issue 18, the reins went to Crumb's wife, cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb (except for issue 25, which was again edited by Bagge). The three editorial tenures were known respectively as 'Personal Confessions', the 'Coming of the Bad Boys', and the 'Twisted Sisters'.\n\nWeirdo's final issue, 28, an internationally themed 68-page giant titled Verre D'eau (in French, 'glass of water'), was published in 1993.\n\nThe rather insane list of contributors to Weirdo from 1981 to 1993..\n\nLindsey Arnold, Robert Armstrong, Butch Austin, Algernon Backwash, Ace Backwords, Douglas Bagge, Peter Bagge, Edmond Baudoin, Tony Bertino, Terry Boyce, Charles Burns, Steven Calt, Bruce Carleton, David Carrino, Florence Cestac, Tom Chalkley, William Clark, Daniel Clowes, David Collier, Linda Crothers, Maxon Crumb, Robert Crumb, Sophie Crumb, CTS, Lloyd Dangle, Francis E.
