Though the group's leader, Lemmy Kilminster, had his roots in the hard-rocking space rock band Hawkwind, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead didn't bother with his old group's progressive tendencies, choosing to amplify the heavy biker rock elements of Hawkwind with the speed of punk rock. MotÃƒÂ¶rhead wasn't punk rock -- they formed before the Sex Pistols and they loved the hell-for-leather imagery of bikers too much to conform with the safety-pinned, ripped T-shirts of punk -- but they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Motorhead continued performing into the next century. Although the band changed its lineup many, many times -- Lemmy was its only consistent member -- they never changed their raging sound.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Motorhead\n02.Ace Of Spades\n03.Overkill\n04.Bomber\n05.Love Me Like A Reptile\n06.Shine\n07.No Class\n08.Iron Fist\n09.Dead Men Tell No Tales\n10.Shoot You In The Back\n11.Too Late, Too Late\n12.Killed By Death\n13.Heart Of Stone\n14.Stay Clean\n15.I Got Mine\n16.Orgasmatron\n17.Eat The Rich\n18.Rock 'N' Roll\n19.The One To Sing The Blues\n20.I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care)\n21.Cat Scratch Fever\n22.Hellraiser\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\n02.Death Or Glory\n03.Born To Raise Hell\n04.Sacrifice\n05.Over Your Shoulder\n06.Civil War\n07.Overnight Sensation\n08.Love For Sale\n09.Dogs Of War\n10.Snake Bite Love\n11.Slow Dance\n12.God Save The Queen\n13.Walk A Crooked Mile\n14.Down The Line\n15.Terminal Show\n16.Killers\n17.Sucker\n18.One Night Stand\n19.Devil I Know\n20.Runaround Man\n21.Rock Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
