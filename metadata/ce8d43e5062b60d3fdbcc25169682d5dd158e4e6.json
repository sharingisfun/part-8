Gifford was himself replaced by Bones Hillman in 1987.[1][2][4] Through a long and distinguished career, the band became known for its driving hard-rock sound, intense live performances and political activism, particularly in aid of anti-nuclear, environmentalist and indigenous causes.[6]\n\nMidnight OilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s albums which peaked in the Australian Top Ten were 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Red Sails in the Sunset, Species Deceases, Diesel and Dust, Blue Sky Mining, Scream in Blue, Earth and Sun and Moon, Breathe, 20,000 Watt R.S.L., Redneck Wonderland, The Real Thing, Capricornia and Flat Chat.[7][8] Australian Top Ten singles were &quot;Power and the Passion&quot;, &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;, &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; and &quot;Blue Sky Mine&quot;.[7][8] Aside from chart success, both &quot;Power and the Passion&quot; and &quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; were listed by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in the Top 30 best Australian songs of all time in 2001.[9] In December 2002, Garrett announced that he would seek to further his political career and Midnight Oil disbanded. But they would reform for two warm-up shows in Canberra leading up to their performance at one of the &quot;Sound Relief&quot; charity concerts, in honour of the victims of the &quot;Black Saturday&quot; fires and the &quot;Queensland Floods&quot;.\n\nMidnight Oil won eleven Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Awards during its career,[10] including induction into the Hall of Fame in 2006.[11][12] At the induction, ARIA chairman Denis Handlin described Midnight Oil as true legends that always led by example in a uniquely Australian way with music that is powerful, uncompromising, inspiring, entertaining and enduring. [/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiesel &amp; Dust 1988 (Remastered 2008)\n\n\nDiesel and Dust is an album by Midnight Oil that was released in 1987 under the CBS record label. The album is a concept album about the struggles of the Australian Aborigines and environmental causes, issues both near and dear to the band, and drew inspiration from the Black Fella White Fella tour of remote Indigenous communities with the Warumpi Band in 1985. The rhythm of &quot;Beds are Burning&quot; is said to be inspired by the noise of their vehicles' wheels on the corrugated dirt roads in the region.[citation needed]\n\nThe track &quot;Gunbarrel Highway&quot; was not included on the United States release of the album. Reportedly, it is because the line &quot;shit falls like rain on a land that is brown&quot; was deemed too strong for U.S. audiences.[1][2]\n\nIn 1989, Rolling Stone magazine ranked it number 13 on their list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Beds Are Burning&quot; (Rob Hirst, James Moginie, Peter Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n2.\t&quot;Put Down That Weapon&quot; (Moginie, Hirst, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n3.\t&quot;Dreamworld &quot; (Moginie, Garrett, Hirst) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n4.\t&quot;Arctic World&quot; (Moginie, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n5.\t&quot;Warakurna&quot; (Moginie) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n6.\t&quot;The Dead Heart&quot; (Hirst, Moginie, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n7.\t&quot;Whoah&quot; (Moginie, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n8.\t&quot;Bullroarer&quot; (Hirst, Moginie, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n9.\t&quot;Sell My Soul&quot; (Moginie, Garrett) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n10.\t&quot;Sometimes&quot; (Moginie, Garrett, Hirst) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n11.\t&quot;Gunbarrel Highway&quot; (Midnight Oil) - 3:38 ^\n\n\nNot available on the U.S. or the Canadian LP.
