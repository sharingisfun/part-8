One morning, he discovers a pretty, hippie-esque girl who calls herself Breezy (Kay Lenz) asleep on his front porch. Frank asks her to leave and she politely follows suit; she forgets her guitar, however, and returns the next day to retrieve it. Breezy also asks Frank if he would be so kind as to let her take a bath; he agrees, and even lets her sleep at his house that night. A few days later, Breezy turns up at again at Frank's doorstep, with a cop in tow -- after being arrested for vagrancy, she told the police that she lived here with her uncle Frank. Frank plays along and, against his better judgment, agrees to let her stay with him. After spending some time together, Frank and Breezy begin opening up to each other, discussing their feelings on a variety of issues. A friendship grows between them that, in time, becomes a love affair, but Frank's friends find fault in his new romance, and he breaks it off -- a decision he comes to regret. This was the first film Clint Eastwood directed in which he did not star, something he would not do again until Bird  in 1988. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Breezy (1973).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 690 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Overall bit rate : 906 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Bit rate : 789 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.161\n      Stream size : 601 MiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.0.2 (UTC 2004-08-29)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 46mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 104 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 79.2 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 177 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n      Language : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069822/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069822/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio, no subtitles\n\nClint Eastwood - Breezy (1973) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e6d2d74d7fd850dedb3c14888132d8a76e605ec","amp;dn":"Clint+Eastwood+-+Breezy+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e6d2d74d7fd850dedb3c14888132d8a76e605ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,109,45,116,215,253,133,13,237,179,193,72,136,19,45,138,118,230,5,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
