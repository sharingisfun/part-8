Since this book contains older and obsolete information that is readily available in prior online PDF editions, future editions might eliminate much of this information for a smaller but more current tome. Technical data changes too fast to be current, but the historical perspectives, conceptual diagrams and figures, and how-to techniques that reference online data sources would be invaluable.\r\nThe historical backgrounds are especially invaluable in understanding the current state of computer hardware and how we got there. This information is probably available on the Internet by searching multiple sites, but in this book it is already all there in one place in a very easy to understand format. The time saved from this convenience can not be overstated.\r\nTo supplement this book Scott Mueller still has a forum website for updated information, questions, and comments related to all aspects of the book. In addition the Que Store book reference page also has excellent free DVD videos, resources, and articles to supplement this book (that are updated daily).\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nScott Mueller is the president of Mueller Technical Research (MTR), an international research and corporate training firm. Since 1982, MTR has produced the industryâ€™s most in-depth, accurate, and effective seminars, books, articles, videos, and FAQs covering PC hardware and data recovery. MTR maintains a client list that includes Fortune 500 companies, U.S. and foreign governments, major software and hardware corporations, as well as PC enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. Scottâ€™s seminars have been presented to several thousands of PC support professionals throughout the world.\r\nScott personally teaches seminars nationwide covering all aspects of PC hardware (including troubleshooting, maintenance, repair, and upgrade), A+ Certification, and data recovery/forensics. He has a knack for making technical topics not only understandable, but entertaining; his classes are never boring! If you have ten or more people to train, Scott can design and present a custom seminar for your organization.\r\nAlthough he has taught classes virtually nonstop since 1982, Scott is best known as the author of the longest-running, most popular, and most comprehensive PC hardware book in the world, Upgrading and Repairing PCs, which has become the core of an entire series of books, including Upgrading and Repairing PCs, Upgrading and Repairing Laptops, and Upgrading and Repairing Windows.\r\nScottâ€™s premiere work, Upgrading and Repairing PCs, has sold more than two million copies, making it by far the most popular and longest-running PC hardware book on the market today. Scott has been featured in Forbes magazine and has written several articles for PC World magazine, Maximum PC magazine, the Scott Mueller Forum, various computer and automotive newsletters, and the Upgrading and Repairing PCs website.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\n1 Development of the PC\r\n2 PC Components, Features, and System Design\r\n3 Processor Types and Specifications\r\n4 Motherboards and Buses\r\n5 BIOS\r\n6 Memory\r\n7 The ATA/IDE Interface\r\n8 Magnetic Storage\r\n9 Flash and Removable Storage\r\n10 Optical Storage\r\n11 Video Hardware\r\n12 Audio Hardware\r\n13 External I/O Interfaces\r\n14 Input Devices\r\n15 Internet Connectivity\r\n16 Local Area Networking\r\n17 Power Supplies\r\n18 Building or Upgrading Systems\r\n19 PC Diagnostics, Testing, and Maintenance\r\n \nhttp://s2.postimg.org/oy7ear2ex/Upgrading_and_Repairing_PCs_22nd_Edition.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc4f4c0d1c089de363bfce2b2541d013bc4515e","amp;dn":"Upgrading+and+Repairing+PCs+%2822nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc4f4c0d1c089de363bfce2b2541d013bc4515e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,196,244,192,209,192,137,222,54,59,252,226,178,84,29,1,59,196,81,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
