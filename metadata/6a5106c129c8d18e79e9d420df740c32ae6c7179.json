S. Bugrov, S. M. Nikolsky.\n\n  What this text is about?\n  \n  The present book is the first part of our three-part textbook\n  Higher-Mathematics. We deal here with the fundamentals of the theory\n  of deteminants, the elements of theory of matrices, the theory of\n  systems of linear equations, and vector algebra. The book is also\n  intended to introduce its readers to the basic aspects of linear\n  algebra: linear operators, orthogonal transformations, self-adjoint\n  operators, the quadratic forms and reducing it to the canonical\n  form. Elements of analytical geometry (the straight line, the plane,\n  the straight line in space, and second order curves and surfaces)\n  are also included.  \n \n  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant and\n  was first published by Mir Publishers in 1982.\n  \n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 2.4 MB | Pages: 190 |\n\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\t\n \n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface 6\n1.
