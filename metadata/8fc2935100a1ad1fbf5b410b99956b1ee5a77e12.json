Take your pick.*\n*Uses custom KMS folder in Windows directory. I've included the uninstall\nscript if you want to use a different activator later\n-Highly Compressed install.esd recovery compression format.\n-DaRT 8.1 integrated into boot.wim recovery options. Choose Repair\nyour computer, Troubleshoot, then MS DaRT options to open. Features\ninclude an offline defender a/v scanner, password reset tool, registry\neditor, offline hotfix removal, system file checker, and many more.\n-UEFI boot information added to ISO boot data\n\nNotes:\n-All indexes use original MSDN 9/9 Win8.1 isos with integrated hotfixes.\n-Added ei.cfg to sources directory. You *HAVE* to extract the iso and\ndelete the file if you want to upgrade from a previous version of\nWindows. Use the win81-pkeys.txt on the ISO for install keys.\n-This version uses qad's v5 KMS server service build with integrated\nWinDivert functionality from Windivert 1.1.1 WDDK.\n-I have observed a rare occasion where setup fails at 88 percent on a\nvm I use for testing. It is likely related to the install.esd recovery\ncompression, but rebooting and re-trying setup seems to fix the issue.\nIf the problem persists in future, I may resort back to the install.wim\nand large versions with monthly patches. I only noticed this in the x64\nversion, but it's possible it could be present in the x86 version as well.\nIf I do resort to install.wim versions in the future, I'd likely start\na separate pro single-index version like I did with win8.0. I re-integrated\neverything on the x64 and the problem did not seem to disappear, but like\nI said; it's rare and reboot fixes it.\n\nCredits:\nqad, CODYQX4, mikmik38, nosferati87, etc - Activator*\n*Honestly, many more people worked on the project, but I can't name\nthem all. There's too many.\nmurphy78 - Testing, Activator work, Sysprepping and ISO design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc2935100a1ad1fbf5b410b99956b1ee5a77e12","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+20in1+x64+en-US+Pre-Activated+DaRT+8.1+Dec2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc2935100a1ad1fbf5b410b99956b1ee5a77e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,194,147,81,0,161,173,31,191,91,65,11,153,149,107,30,229,167,126,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
