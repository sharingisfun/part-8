Upon returning to the Earthly plane, Kid starts fighting evil criminals using his powers of intangibility, invisibility, and (not making this up) raising dead historical figures from their graves to help in superhero battle.&quot;\n\nModern incarnation\n\n&quot;In the 1990s, a different and darker version of the character was introduced. This was done with a three-issue mini-series written by Grant Morrison with art by Duncan Fegredo in 1991. This version returned the Kid to his nameless roots and severed ties with the Marvel Family. While it kept most of the original continuity intact, it also made some significant changes to the character&amp;#039;s back story.&quot;\n\nAbout the series in this torrent:\n\n&quot;When DC began their mature-readers Vertigo imprint, they went back to Kid Eternity, with a new series written by Ann Nocenti with art by Sean Phillips. This series quickly moved away from the continuity established by Morrison, and instead focused on the everyman qualities of the character. It lasted 16 issues (May 1993 - September 1994)&quot;\n\nThis torrent includes the 16 issues plus the Vertigo Jam short story published in August 1993.
