Beginning in the mid- to late '60s as a Beatlesque ensemble, they quickly developed as songwriters and singers to create a style of their own that carried them from psychedelia to progressive pop. Then, after hitting a popular trough, they reinvented themselves as perhaps the most successful white soul act of all time. What remained a constant throughout their history is their extraordinary singing, rooted in three voices that were appealing individually and melded together perfectly.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.New York Mining Disaster 1941\n02.To Love Somebody\n03.Holiday\n04.Massachusetts\n05.World\n06.Words\n07.I've Gotta Get A Message To You\n08.I Started A Joke\n09.First Of May\n10.Melody Fair\n11.Saved By The Bell\n12.Don't Forget To Remember\n13.Lonely Days\n14.How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n15.My World\n16.Jive Talkin'\n17.Run To Me\n18.Nights On Broadway\n19.Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)\n20.Love So Right\n21.If I Can't Have You\n22.You Should Be Dancing (Long Remix Version)\n23.Spicks And Specks\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Stayin' Alive\n02.How Deep Is Your Love\n03.Night Fever\n04.More Than A Woman\n05.Emotion\n06.Too Much Heaven\n07.Tragedy\n08.Love You Inside Out\n09.Guilty\n10.Heartbreaker\n11.Islands In The Stream\n12.You Win Again\n13.One\n14.Secret Love\n15.For Whom The Bells Toll\n16.Alone\n17.Immortality\n18.This Is Where I Came In\n19.Man In The Middle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed.****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c1fcb2448d36d42df84cdd5fd39af3ae523d11","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+mp3%40320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c1fcb2448d36d42df84cdd5fd39af3ae523d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,193,252,178,68,141,54,212,45,248,76,221,95,211,154,243,174,82,61,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
