Born into poverty in the South, he ran afoul of the law by the late '40s on an armed robbery conviction. With the help of singer Bobby Byrd's family, Brown gained parole and started a gospel group with Byrd, changing their focus to R&amp;B as the rock revolution gained steam. The Flames, as the Georgian group was known in the mid-'50s, signed to Federal/King and had a huge R&amp;B hit right off the bat with the wrenching, churchy ballad &quot;Please, Please, Please.&quot; By that point, the Flames had become James Brown &amp; the Famous Flames; the charisma, energy, and talent of Brown made him the natural star attraction.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Get Up I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine\n02.Super Bad\n03.Since You Been Gone\n04.Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\n05.There Was A Time (I Got To Move)\n06.Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Nothing\n07.Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved\n08.Soul Power\n09.Get Up I Feel Like Being A Sex Machine\n10.Fight Against Drug Abuse - Public Service Announcement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0220f5f9cccfaa181904c4d996f27b957adc078","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+Funk+Power+1970%3A+A+Brand+New+Thang+%281996%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0220f5f9cccfaa181904c4d996f27b957adc078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,34,15,95,156,204,250,161,129,144,76,77,153,111,39,185,87,173,192,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
