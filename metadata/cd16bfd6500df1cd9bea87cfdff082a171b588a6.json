ADORNO (1903-1969) was a German sociologist, philosopher and musicologist famous for his work in critical theory.  A leading member of the &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; of social research, his work was associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the work of Freud, Marx and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society.  He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists.\r\n\r\n\r\n==&gt; CONTENTS: In addition to several new titles, this updated torrent includes many ePUB editions of books previously available only in PDF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* AESTHETIC THEORY (Continuum, 2002 / Bloomsbury, 2013).
