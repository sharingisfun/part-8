Content\n** is essentially the same, but image quality should be improved.\n\nComputer and Video Games (C+VG) was a long-running multi-format UK-based\nmagazine. It went through several phases; at first, it was very much a\nhobbyist magazine, with plenty of type-ins and technical articles. Like\nmost 80's UK computer magazines, it went a bit mad as the market got\nsaturated and relaunched as an entertainment title, with some bizarre\nand ill-fitting Jerry Paris cartoon characters &quot;running the magazine&quot;.\nAfter a while it settled down into a generic multi-format entertainment\nmag focussed mainly on consoles. It continued in print form until 2004,\nand still continues today as a web site.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\nwww.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nSome issues of C+VG included a supplement - these have been added to the\nend of the magazine. The 1984 and 1985 yearbooks are also included.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the\nsource images. More than most, later issues of C+VG used all sorts of\nmixed fonts, flooded backdrops and everything else that makes the OCR\nsoftware's life more difficult; some of the pages are barely readable by\nhuman eyes!\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or just Google &quot;RetroPDFs&quot;) for more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and ADJB and everyone else on the WoS forums\nfor help and advice.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
