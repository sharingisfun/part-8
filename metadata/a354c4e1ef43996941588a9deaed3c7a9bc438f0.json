He reminisces of his childhood and a beautiful, mysterious woman he has been unable to forget. As he walks through his old village he catches a glimpse of the same woman he fell in love with in his youth. However, she has not aged since the day he saw her. He follows her but is not ready for what he finds.\n\nRuntime........: 75 mins\nVideo Bitrate..: 900 kbps\nAudio Bitrate..: 448 kbps AC3 5.1 ch\nAspect Ratio...: 1.85:1\nResolution.....: 592 x 320\nFrame Rate.....: 25.000 fps\nAudio Language.: Spanish/German\nSubtitles......: English\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a354c4e1ef43996941588a9deaed3c7a9bc438f0","amp;dn":"Spectre.2006.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT%286+FILMS+TO+KEEP+YOU+AWAKE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a354c4e1ef43996941588a9deaed3c7a9bc438f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,84,196,225,239,67,153,105,65,88,138,157,234,237,60,122,155,196,56,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
