Theres all sorts of Northern on it from Stompers\nfloaters/oldies/modern/crossover but all still the soul we love.\nI have tried to only add sounds over the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£100 mark and quite a few into 4 figures. And although \nalot of these are my own I have \\'BORROWED\\' some from friends and other peeps on the scene.\n\nIm not saying that I agree with the high prices put on some of these but with the coming back\nto the scene of alot of the old niter crowd who now have some dosh in thier pocket they are\npaying over the odds for them. This has been good for the ones who have sat on their sounds\nover time and want to make a few quid.\nI hope you enjoy these and they give you some tingles and goosebumps! Get them on, turn the \nsound up and boogie like nobodys watching!\nLove and peace.\nUnionjack\n\n5 of a kind   the other side\n7 miles per hour band playing your game\n7th Avenue Aviators You Should O\\' Held On\nA touch of velvet - a sting of brass\nadmirations - heaven is in your arms\nAl Wiliams Ii am nothing\nAllan Sisters Im in with the downtown crowd .\nAmbassadors I need someone\nAmbers  Potion of love\nAndre Brasseur The Kid\nArabians  You Upset Me Baby\nArcades  Theres got to be a loser\nArt Freeman Slipping around with you\nArthur Alexander  Keep her guessing\nArthur Freeman  You got me uptight\nAudrey Winters Thank you baby\nAugust and Deneen We go together\nBabe Ruth Elusive\nBenny Spellman  Fortune teller\nBernard Smith and Jokers Wild - Gotta be a reason\nBetty Everett  Bye bye baby\nBetty Turner The winds kept laughing\nBill Brandon and Lorraine Johnson  Full time groover\nBillie Davis  Just walk my shoes\nBilly Arnell  Tough girl\nBilly Harner What about the music\nBilly Prophet  What can i do\nBilly Thompson Black eyed girl\nBilly Woods Let me make you happy\nBits  n  Pieces  Keep on running away\nBob Fred I ll be on my way\nBob Kuban The Cheater\nBobby Goldsboro  Too many people\nBobby Hutton  Lend A Hand\nBobby Paris  I Walked Away\nBobby Patterson Till you give in\nBobby Rich there s a girl somewhere for me\nBobby Sheen Dr Love\nBobby Ttreetop  Wait till i get to know ya\nBrice Coefield Ain t that right\nBrooks Brothers  Looking for a woman\nBuster and Eddie I can`t be still\nCajun Hart  Got to find a way\nCarl Holmes and the Commanders  Soul dance no.3\nCarl Spencer Cover girl\nCarl Underwood Ain t you lying\nCarlena  Just brothers\nCarstairs IIt Really Hurts Me Girl\nCecil Washington  I don t like to lose\nCesars  Girl i miss you\nCharades  The key to my happiness\nCharles Sheffield  It s your voodoo working\nCindy Scott  I love you baby\nClarence Hill  Alot of lovin goin round\nClarence Townsend I found a new love\ncold hearted blues the soul city\nCollins Collins Top of the stairs\nConstellations  I didn t know how to\nCurtis Lee  Is she in your town\nCurtis Liggins indications\nDamon Fox Packing Up\nDanny Monday  Baby without you\nDanny Moore  Somebody new\nDanny Wagner I lost a True Love\nDel Larks Job opening\nDel Larks Out of the in crowd\nDennis Edwards I Didnt Have Too But I Did\nDiplomats  Cards on the table\nDon Gardner Cheatin Kind\nEddie Spencer If this is love (i d rather be lonely)\nEddie Whitehead - Just Your Fool\nElbie Parker Please keep away from me\nErnest Mosley Stubborn heart\nErnestine Eady  Lets Talk It Over\nErnie Washington Lonesome shack\nEsther Grant Lets Make The Most Out Of Love\nExecutive Four  I gotta good thing going\nExecutive Four  I \\'ll make it up\nFabulous Moonlighters For granted\nFascinators In other words\nFred and the Turbins  Bernadine\nGarland Green Girl i love you\nGarland Green It rained forty days   nights\nGene Anderson Do you love me baby\nGene Toones  What more do you want\nGeno Washington Im so in love with you\nGeorge Kirby  What can i do\ngeorge lemons - fascinating girl\nGerri Hall  Who can I run to\nGracie Dumas Song of a woman\nGwen Owens - Just Say Youre Wanted (And Needed)\nHank Hodge One  Way Love\nHank Jjacobs Elijah rockin  with soul\nharold burrage fifty fifty\nharry starr - another time another place\nHeadlines He s looking for love\nHerb Ward  Strange change\nHerman Lewis Whos Kissing You Tonite\nHoney &amp;
