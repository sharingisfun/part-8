With this hands-on guide, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its bestÃ¢â‚¬â€and possibly most neglectedÃ¢â‚¬â€features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.\n\nMany experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.\n\nThis book covers:\n\nPython data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects\nData structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age\nFunctions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns\nObject-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance\nControl flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages\nMetaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45321e951bfa2dbd3e179f996f8275317bc7ccb6","amp;dn":"Fluent+Python+-+1st+Edition+%282015%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45321e951bfa2dbd3e179f996f8275317bc7ccb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,50,30,149,27,250,45,189,62,23,159,153,111,130,117,49,123,199,204,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
