The Skill and sincerity with which he sings make him an outstanding performer in any number he undertakes, whether it is ballads, blues or hymns. Earl Scruggs managed to play tunes on his banjo before he was five years old. At the age of ten, he developed a unique style of playing the banjo with three fingers which is known nationally as Scruggs-Style Picking. In 1945, when he first came to Nashville, he dazzled audiences with this new, hard-driving, three-fingered technique. It was this artistry that gave life to a band style called Bluegrass.\n\nCombining two of Lester Flatt &amp; Earl Scruggs Columbia LPs from the early 60s, 1962s Folk Songs of Our Land and 1963s Hard Travelin, on a single CD, this set hardly skips a heartbeat between the two original releases since both are cut from the same fabric, featuring bluegrass renditions of old folk and country tunes like Ellen Smith, The Wreck of the Old 97, Deep Blue Sea, and Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land, as well as the duos hit theme song from the Beverly Hillbillies television show, The Ballad of Jed Clampett. Its fun. Its bluegrass. Its Flatt &amp; Scruggs. (allmusic.com)\n\n- - -\n\nLester Flatt and Earl Scruggs - Folk Songs of Our Land-Hard Travelin' 1962-1963\n(T-Bird 2010)\n\n 1.
