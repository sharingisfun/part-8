The Colossus Rises\n\n2. Lost in Babylon\n\n3. The Tomb of Shadows\n\n1. The Colossus Rises\nJUST ONE BOY...\nJack McKinley is an ordinary kid with an extraordinary problem. In six months, Jack is going to die.\n\nJUST ONE MISSION...\nAfter Jack collapses in the middle of a busy street, he's whisked off to a strange hospital in a strange place. There are armed guards and weird kids and fantastic creatures, not to mention no parents, no phones, and no possibility of escape. The place is run by an odd professor named Bhegad, who tells Jack that what's killing him is a genetic trait inherited from the prince of a long-lost civilization. It's destroying Jack by making him too strong too fast. He'll need to stay strong, though -- because it's up to him to save the world.\n\nJUST ONE PROBLEM .\nThat long-lost civilization sank when seven magic Loculi were stolen and hidden around the world. Now Jack and his friends must find the Loculi before they fall into the wrong hands. If they don't, they'll never be cured, that lost world will rise, oceans will be displaced, and life as we know it will pretty much end.\n\n2. Lost in Babylon\nThe adventure continues as Jack and his friends travel to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in the pulse-pounding second title in the Seven Wonders series.\n\nWith Marco gone and the first Loculus lost, Jack, Cass, and Ally are no closer to saving themselves (or the world) than when they first arrived at the Karai Institute. But when Bhegad tracks down Marco deep in the desert, the kids are off on the next leg of their quest-to the ancient city of Babylon. There the kids find themselves faced with a daunting choice that makes them question everything they've learned so far. It's a gut wrenching decision, but what the kids don't realize is that it's also a trap. Surprises pile on surprises until a long-lost figure from Jack's past returns, and the kids find themselves forced to engineer an escape that might just turn out to be a different kind of trap altogether...\n\n3. The Tomb of Shadows\nPercy Jackson meets Indiana Jones in the New York Times bestselling adventure Seven Wonders! The Tomb of Shadows is the third in a seven-book series by master storyteller Peter Lerangis. This sequel to the bestselling Lost in Babylon and The Colossus Rises chronicles the adventures of Jack McKinley and his friends in a life-or-death race to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. In the rubble of this Wonder of the Ancient World, they have to face down their own demons and engage in an epic battle with foes long gone. But when promises are broken, blood is spilledÃ¢â‚¬â€and the Select are left with no choice but to destroy the one thing that might have saved them all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d9d26f74d88c1e6a9df4ad3adefb84f2190093","amp;dn":"Seven+Wonders+Series+by+Peter+Lerangis+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d9d26f74d88c1e6a9df4ad3adefb84f2190093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,217,210,111,116,216,140,30,106,157,244,173,58,222,251,132,242,25,0,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
