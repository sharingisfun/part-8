Astonishing in the sheer detail it amasses, the book is the first comprehensive attempt to catalogue and analyze the crimes of Communism over seventy years.\n\n&quot;Revolutions, like trees, must be judged by their fruit,&quot; Ignazio Silone wrote, and this is the standard the authors apply to the Communist experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€in the China of &quot;the Great Helmsman,&quot; Kim Il Sung's Korea, Vietnam under &quot;Uncle Ho&quot; and Cuba under Castro, Ethiopia under Mengistu, Angola under Neto, and Afghanistan under Najibullah. The authors, all distinguished scholars based in Europe, document Communist crimes against humanity, but also crimes against national and universal culture, from Stalin's destruction of hundreds of churches in Moscow to Ceausescu's leveling of the historic heart of Bucharest to the widescale devastation visited on Chinese culture by Mao's Red Guards.\n\nAs the death toll mountsÃ¢â‚¬â€as many as 25 million in the former Soviet Union, 65 million in China, 1.7 million in Cambodia, and on and onÃ¢â‚¬â€the authors systematically show how and why, wherever the millenarian ideology of Communism was established, it quickly led to crime, terror, and repression. An extraordinary accounting, this book amply documents the unparalleled position and significance of Communism in the hierarchy of violence that is the history of the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57a8aaad7a61d40da0a747bcf3051ab0b35c942e","amp;dn":"The+Black+Book+of+Communism%3A+Crimes%2C+Terror%2C+Repression","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57a8aaad7a61d40da0a747bcf3051ab0b35c942e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,168,170,173,122,97,212,13,160,167,71,188,243,5,26,176,179,92,148,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
