But, as always with my releases, 320, 500x500 art, properly tagged. I took me a while to find high quality uploads of these releases, especially the 2nd album which I encoded from FLAC, as well as the EP.\n\nStudio Releases\n1. Fallout\n2. Second Skin\n\nEP\n3. Motion: Live*\n\n*Note: Original quality is low, I encoded from a FLAC I found somewhere, it doesn't really warrant a 320 encode, but my encoder was already set to that.\n\nAs always, Enjoy, and please seed, as there are no 320's of this discog anywhere.\n\nHMD3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a04f12f29d90abd4cffc8226b10b4c8b4833a1f","amp;dn":"The+Mayfield+Four+Discography+%5B320%5D%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a04f12f29d90abd4cffc8226b10b4c8b4833a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,4,241,47,41,217,10,189,76,255,200,34,107,16,180,200,180,131,58,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
