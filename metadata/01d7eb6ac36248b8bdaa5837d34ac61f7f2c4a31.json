It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nI hope you find Clojure\\\\\\'s combination of facilities elegant, powerful, practical and fun to use.\n-----------------------------\nThe Joy of Clojure\nMICHAEL FOGUS, CHRIS HOUSER\nMANNING (2011)\n-----------------------------\nFrom the book:\n\nThis isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t intended as a first book on programming, and it may not be an ideal first book on Clojure either. The authors assume youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re fearless and, importantly, equipped with a search engine. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll want to have Google handy as you go through the examples. The authors blaze through many of the classics of both functional programming and industry programming in a whirlwind tour of Clojure that feels at times more like a class-five tropical storm. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn fast!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBTW.
