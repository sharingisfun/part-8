He even tries making a few of his own.\nArchitect George Clarke helps imaginations run wild as once again he celebrates the extraordinary world of small spaces and unique builds. This series features secret hideaways, space-saving retreats, eco-friendly bolt holes and reconditioned vehicles and particularly celebrates the potential to create small space builds in your own back yard. With the help of his design buddy, master craftsman Will Hardie, George sets out to transform his own wasted garden space into the ultimate family garden studio; with a games room, cinema room, planetarium and, fulfilling a childhood ambition of his own, a butterfly house.\n\n\n1)  A Fairytale Hideaway \nGeorge meets Olly and Tamsin in Bolton, who want to create a fairytale wooden hideaway at the bottom of their garden for just Ã‚Â£1000. And in Kent, landscape gardener Barry and his girlfriend Deleck seek to recreate a classic Teardrop trailer with an ocean twist.\n\n2)  Airstream Caravan \nGeorge meets a young couple risking their life savings on making a family home out of an old Airstream caravan as they bid to get on the property ladder. George meets a couple who think they've come up with the solution to all year round camping. George and Will's road trip across Texas continues with a visit to an abandoned UFO-style futuristic home; as well as a suburban home given a complete makeover with 50,000 beer cans. And George's ambitious plan for a multipurpose garden building for him and his kids gets a reality check.\n\n3)  Pod Hotel \nGeorge meets motorbike racer Ollie, who's fed up with sleeping in the back of a transit van when away at competitions and wants to transform a double decker coach into a Japanese-style pod hotel. George and Will's road trip across Texas takes in a building entirely made of rubbish. And George's own garden build takes shape as he and Will attempt to erect the entire studio structure in 15 minutes. George meets the man who helped his daughter onto the property ladder by building her a home in his back garden for just Ã‚Â£12,000. There's also James, who designed a truly accessible glamping pod after being left bedridden for eight months following a car crash..\nGeorge also meets Barny and Katus who, inspired by an old family photo, are building a horse drawn caravan that will be home to their family as they make a tour across the UK and France at the end of the summer.\n\n4)  Basement Casino \nGeorge meets a Manchester couple who discovered a hidden basement in their new home and decided to spend their nest egg turning it into an underground casino. He also meets a woman building her own shop for Ã‚Â£5000. In Texas, George visits a tiny home made entirely from salvaged materials and a caravan buried deep underground in case the apocalypse arrives.\nAnd an East End garden conversion leaves George green with envy.\n\n5)  Campervan \nGeorge meets a couple who love VW campervans so much they have given up their jobs and sold their home in order to completely drop out of the rat race. They are spending Ã‚Â£40,000 renovating an original split screen van which will become their home on the road. George and Will's Texan road trip brings them to the state capital of Austin, where no more than a mile from city hall a woman has handbuilt a Ã‚Â£10,000 three bed family home from mud. George attempts to fulfill a lifelong ambition of building a butterfly house. He also meets a glamping enthusiast who, having been made wheelchair bound after a motorcycle accident, has set about making luxury glamping pods which are accessible to everyone.\n\n6)  Narrow Boat \nGeorge meets two brothers who can't afford to get on the property ladder and plan to transform a fire-damaged narrow boat into a luxury bachelor pad.\nGeorge also meets a police officer from Somerset who wants to convert an old campervan and caravan into a mobile cream-tea business. And in Texas, George and Will discover an extraordinary 1950s trailer on the edge of the desert.\n\n7)  Georges Build Unveiled \nThe architect finishes work on his project to transform his unloved back garden into a creative family space, and heads to Cambridgeshire, where he meets a DIY perfectionist who is hoping to build the smallest-ever campervan. In Somerset, George finds out about a local man's plan to turn a horse trailer into a mobile cheese stall and food festival attraction.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bildr.no/image/ZHRhUHJk.jpeg&quot;
