Beyond the figures and graphics who are the people affected today in their daily activities by these change ?\nWhat choices are they facing and what solutions have they found to maintain a sustainable activity on the land of their ancestors? Witness the global changes from a local and multicultural perspective.\n\n\n1)  Norway \nFollowing the Sami reindeer herders in Norway as they deal with the effects of the warming tundra.\n\n2)  Mongolia \nMongolian cattle herders content with the changing continental winds, causing drought and extreme cold.\n\n3)  Oman \nA picture of how fishers and farmers are affected by the changing oceans and more intensive storms.\n\n4)  Namibia \nShowing how the Lozi people of the Caprivi try to maintain their way of life in the face of increased flooding.\n\n5)  Greece \nIn the last 10 years, Greece has endured the worst fires in the Mediterranean basin of this era. Beyond the climatic factors at stake in this tragedy (rise in summer temperatures by 6 degrees, a decrease of rainfalls and a shortage in water resources,) a lot could be done to slow down the effects of fire and protect the land and the inhabitants.\n\n6)  Nepal \nSolukhumbu is one of the 75 districts in Nepal. It gathers most of the 3300 glaciers and 2300 artic lakes of the country. Inhabitants witness huge climatic changes in the Everest area. The most striking being the fast glacier recession, which have given birth to new lakes where there was only ice and snow. Those lakes are a danger for the population, natural bombs, ready to explode. If the water overflows, it will sweep away inhabitants, bridges, houses and villages.\n\n7)  France \nIn the Alps, the climatic change effects are 3 times higher than the world average. Moreover, it appears in densely inhabited territories. Since 2003, climate warming turned alarming. The changes in the weather (more rain and less snow) are leading to natural risks as avalanche, floods, and collapsesÃ‚â€¦\nThe local inhabitants have to adapt their way of livesÃ‚â€¦ but also the European people who depend on the water coming out of the glaciers.\n\n8)  Brazil \nParÃƒÂ  is the 2nd biggest State in Brazil. It is also the most exposed to climatic changes flirting with both extremes: long-time dryness followed by violent floods all year long. As a result many inhabitants move to the Amazon river banks, making the agriculture and farming more and more difficult.\n\n9)  Jordan \nJordan is the 4th dryest country in the world. The lack of water has been a recurrent issue in this region. But the climate change has lead to a dramatic situation with a water deficit estimated to over 500 million m3 a year. The Kingdom has taken drastic measures to fight back: 90% of the rain is collected and the government has a strict water distribution program. These solutions are sadly not enough, as the Jordan population grows at a 3% rate a year and has seen half a million Iraqi refugees settle in this region.\n\n10)  Germany \nThe German Halligen islands, in the North Sea are threatened by the rise of the sea level, which could lead to their disappearance as EuropeÃ‚â€™s first climatic refugees. These Islands and their inhabitants are exposed to sudden rises of the sea level called Ã‚â€œLand UnterÃ‚â€ at least 10 to 30 times a year. A frequency in constant rising which will inevitably force the islanders to live off these islands\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/4403/9rl6.jpg&quot;
