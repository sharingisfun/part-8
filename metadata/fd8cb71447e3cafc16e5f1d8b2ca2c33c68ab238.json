Vollin restores her completely, but also envisions her as his \\&quot;Lenore,\\&quot; and cooks up a scheme to kidnap the woman and torture and kill her fiance\\&amp;#039; and father in his Poe-inspired dungeon. To do his dirty work, Vollin recruits a wanted criminal (Boris Karloff), and turns him into a hideous monster to guarantee his subservience.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026912/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026912/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBlack &amp; White\nDuration: 59:11mins\nFile Size:\nFrame Rate: 25 fps - PAL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd8cb71447e3cafc16e5f1d8b2ca2c33c68ab238","amp;dn":"The+Raven-Boris.Karloff-Bela.Lugosi%5B1935%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd8cb71447e3cafc16e5f1d8b2ca2c33c68ab238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,140,183,20,71,227,202,252,22,229,241,216,178,202,44,51,198,138,178,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
