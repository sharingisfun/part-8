Brash Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) has promised his shy pal Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra) that he will introduce Clarence to all the glamorous movie starlets whom he allegedly knows so well. Actually, the only actress whom Joseph meets is bit player Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson). He arranges for the golden-throated Susan to be auditioned by musician JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Iturbi, but when she seems to want to return the favor romantically, Brady tries to foist the girl off on Clarence. But Clarence only has eyes for a fellow Brooklynite (Pamela Britton). Also involved in the plot machinations is runaway orphan Donald Martin (Dean Stockwell). Featuring Kelly dancing with such partners as a cartoon mouse (courtesy of MGM's house animators Bill Hanna and Joseph Barbera), Anchors Aweigh was a huge hit in 1945, assuring audiences future Gene Kelly/Frank Sinatra teamings. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037514/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037514/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEng-subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-28591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-28591&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nGeorge Sidney\n\n\n        Frank Sinatra\t ... \tClarence Doolittle\n\tKathryn Grayson\t... \tSusan Abbott\n\n\tGene Kelly\t... \tJoseph Brady\n\tJosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Iturbi\t... \tHimself\n\tDean Stockwell\t... \tDonald Martin - Child runaway\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:19:19\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1218 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,17 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:312be3b32b2132f0fb759d53e51d30d923034374","amp;dn":"Anchors+Aweigh+%281945%29+Frank+Sinatra%2C+Kathryn+Grayson%2C+Gene+Kelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"312be3b32b2132f0fb759d53e51d30d923034374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,43,227,179,43,33,50,240,251,117,157,83,229,29,48,217,35,3,67,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
