Agus\n2012 | ISBN: 1451610173, 145161019X | English | 352 Pages | EPUB | 0.75 MB\n\nCan we live robustly until our last breath? Do we have to suffer from debilitating conditions and sickness? Is it possible to add more vibrant years to our lives? In The End of Illness, David B. Agus, MD, one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading cancer doctors, researchers, and technology innovators, tackles these fundamental questions, challenging long-held wisdoms and dismantling misperceptions about what Ã¢â‚¬Å“healthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ means. With a blend of storytelling, landmark research, and provocative ideas on health, Dr. Agus presents an eye-opening picture of the human body and all of the ways it worksÃ¢â‚¬â€and failsÃ¢â‚¬â€showing us how a new perspective on our individual health will allow each of us to achieve that often elusive but now reachable goal of a long, vigorous life.\nWhen Dr. Agus decided to pursue a career in oncology, many of his mentors questioned his choice. Why, they asked, would a promising young doctor want to enter a field known for its inescapably grim outcomes? But it was precisely the lack of progress that inspired Dr. Agus to join the war on cancer. He moved away from the modern methods of the medical establishment, which aim to reduce our afflictions to a single point. Instead, as he does in this book, Dr. Agus argues for the adoption of a systemic viewÃ¢â‚¬â€a way of honoring our bodies as complex, whole systems. This outlook informs how we can avoid all illnessesÃ¢â‚¬â€not just cancer. Dr. Agus empowers us to take charge of our individual health in personal, customized ways we could not have imagined before.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f86c2eac4ca803371b44c68952baeec42d6692","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Illness+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f86c2eac4ca803371b44c68952baeec42d6692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,248,108,46,172,76,168,3,55,27,68,198,137,82,186,238,196,45,102,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
