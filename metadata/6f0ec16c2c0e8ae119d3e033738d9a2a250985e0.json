In time, he was drawn to jazz-rock fusion and worked outside the band with John McLaughlin, Stanley Clarke, and others. Though the mid-Seventies saw Santana becoming involved in spiritual mysticism (he affixed &quot;Devadip&quot; before his name), and by the decade's end his band was back in hard-driving rhythmic form and chalked up several hit dance singles. The group continued to perform off and on into the Nineties; in 1994 Santana appeared at Woodstock '94, one of three acts who had previously performed at the original 1969 festival that were asked to return to the 25th anniversary concert. Five years later, Clive Davis signed the band to Arista Records and, by teaming Santana with a varied host of current hitmakers (including Wyclef Jean and Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty), orchestrated one of the most phenomenal comeback stories in rock &amp; roll history.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Jingo &gt; 9:38\n02.Persuasion &gt; 7:05\n03.Treat &gt; 9:37\n04.Chunk A Funk &gt; 5:58\n05.Fried Neck Bones And Some Home Fries &gt; 10:09\n06.Conquistadore Rides Again &gt; 8:40\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Soul Sacrifice &gt; 14:30\n02.As The Years Go Passing By &gt; 7:49\n03.Freeway &gt; 30:15\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0ec16c2c0e8ae119d3e033738d9a2a250985e0","amp;dn":"+Santana+-+Live+At+The+Fillmore+%5C%2768+%281997%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0ec16c2c0e8ae119d3e033738d9a2a250985e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,14,193,108,44,14,138,225,25,211,224,51,115,141,154,42,37,9,133,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
