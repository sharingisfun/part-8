People love pictures because they communicate instantly and eloquently. Here in the 1960 Photography Annual are presented about 250 of the best contemporary pictures from all over the world-plus a retrospective glance at many of this century's finest photographers.\n\nAmong the outstanding features of the 1960 Photography annual is the remarkable &quot;Color Essay of the Year&quot; in which Richard Avedon tells \nhow, on a Life assignment, he photographed Marilyn Monroe impersonating five fabulous sirens of the past: Lillian Russell, Theda Bara, Clara Bow, Jean \nHarlow and Marlene Dietrich. Avedon's dash, imagination, and unfailing good taste plus Marilyn's glamour and impressive talent as a comic actress combined to produce a gay explosion of color, art and nostalgia. The result, in full color, is an unusual testimonial to photography as fun, art and an experiment in the re-creation of history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4486ab42f0d798efce37d654fbf5f97e3ba1cb0f","amp;dn":"Photography+annual+1960+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4486ab42f0d798efce37d654fbf5f97e3ba1cb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,134,171,66,240,215,152,239,206,55,214,84,251,245,249,126,59,161,203,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
