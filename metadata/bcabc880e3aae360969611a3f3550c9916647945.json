Over the years extraordinary stories have been buried or suppressed, and brave people who have attempted to tell the truth have been hindered or condemned or both. Until now.\n\n\n1)  Lost Treasure of the Templars \nJamie Theakston sets out to uncover the remarkable real story of one the greatest treasure quests in modern history and asks if the Knights Templar hid their treasure on an uninhabited island in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia? For over two hundred years, adventurers and researchers have dug deep into the mysterious site hoping to find huge quantities of gold and Holy Relics looted from Jerusalem. In the early nineties a major expedition dug to 33 metres and hit a wooden roof to a large chamber, but within days the chamber was flooded with sea water. Were they potentially going to hit gold or is the treasure buried elsewhere?\n\n2)  Third Secret of Fatima \nHas the Vatican deliberately covered up the true third secret of Fatima? Jamie travels to Portugal to meet leading experts on the Three Secrets of Fatima. These secrets are visions and prophecies allegedly given by the Virgin Mary to three young Portuguese shepherds; Lucia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto in 1917. The Catholic interpretation of the first two secrets involves Hell and the World Wars. Lucia then wrote the third secret down and sealed it in an envelope, which was officially released by Pope John Paul II in 2000. He claimed the secret concerned the earlier attempt on his life, but is he actually covering-up a much more controversial secret?\n\n3)  Bloodline of Christ \nDid Jesus and Mary Magdalene marry and have children? Jamie travels to France to unravel what could be one of the greatest cover-ups in human history and discover for himself the true story of the families who claimed to be the descendants of Jesus Christ. Dozens of respected scholars, authors and historians have legitimate evidence and there are many records of high-ranking families and officials in South West France who openly talk about being part of the 'Desposyni' (The Bloodline).\n\n4)  Mystery of the Giants \nDid giants once walk and live on the earth? In this episode Jamie seeks out and meets the controversial scientists and archaeologists who have extraordinary evidence that proves giants once existed. Researchers have discovered abnormally large bones of what appears to be seven to nine feet humans in networks of elaborate caves, mines and tombs in Sardinia, China, the United States, Northern India and South America. The main question is why has this race of giants seem to have been eradicated from history?\n\n5)  Treasure of Solomon \nWhen the Romans sacked the city of Jerusalem in 70AD, did the fabled Treasure of Solomons temple really get looted and taken back to Rome or was it hidden away by the High Priests? Jamie travels to Jerusalem to meet archaeologists Dr Shimon Gibson and Kate Raphael, who have dedicated their lives work to answer this question. Even today the old Souk in Jerusalem is full of tomb raiders and relic dealers who definitely believe that there are still fantastical Solomonic and Roman treasures to be found under Jerusalem.\n\n6)  Secrets of the Alchemists \nJamie Theakston talks to author Joy Hancox about London's alchemic roots and meets a potion-maker.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/4734/99m4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/4734/99m4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/5817/r92z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/5817/r92z.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/2869/vmac.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/2869/vmac.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/7915/v5ly.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/7915/v5ly.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/189/cqr7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/189/cqr7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5524/6lq6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5524/6lq6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9360/1xej.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9360/1xej.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/9522/lt1v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/9522/lt1v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2420/bcf2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2420/bcf2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3595/x8sd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3595/x8sd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/4954/5vk0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/4954/5vk0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8784/6tov.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/8784/6tov.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0e466769664e423a203f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3033 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 1.03 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-27/jamie-theakston-on-solving-mysteries-in-forbidden-history&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-27/jamie-theakston-on-solving-mysteries-in-forbidden-history&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcabc880e3aae360969611a3f3550c9916647945","amp;dn":"Forbidden+History+3of6+The+Bloodline+of+Christ+720p+x264+AAC+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcabc880e3aae360969611a3f3550c9916647945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,171,200,128,227,170,227,96,150,150,17,163,243,85,12,153,22,100,121,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
