In some of the city's wealthiest families, that power belongs to a close-knit group of maids who have ambition and dreams of their own. The maids are brought together by their jobs, life struggles and the upstairs-downstairs universe of their employers. Rosie, who left Mexico after her husband's death, works for a pair of self-absorbed actors; aspiring singer Carmen hopes that her pop-star employer can help get her career off the ground, but her boss, Odessa, will do whatever it takes to stand in her way; and Zoila works beside her teenage daughter, Valentina, for an emotionally unstable woman. The maids -- along with newcomer Marisol -- turn to one another for support when fellow maid Flora is murdered in her employers' home. Then a loved one gets wrapped up in the murder, and Marisol searches for the truth.\n\nAna Ortiz.........................as Marisol Duarte\nJudy Reyes......................as Zoila Diaz\nDania Ramirez.................as Rosie Falta\nRoselyn Sanchez..............as Carmen Luna\nEdy Ganem......................as Valentina Diaz\nSusan Lucci......................as Genevieve Delatour\nDrew Van Acker...............as Remi Delatour\nBrianna Brown.................as Taylor Stappord\nBrett Cullen.....................as Michael Stappord\nRebecca Wisocky..............as Evelyn Powell\nTom Irwin........................as Adrian Powell\nGrant Show......................as Spence Westmore\nMariana Klaveno...............as Peri Westmore\nMatt Cedeno.....................as Alejandro Rubio\nMelinda Page Hamilton......as Odessa Burakov\nWole Parks.......................as Sam Alexander\nPaula Garces....................as Flora Hernandez\n\n======================================================\nGeneral Information\n======================================================\n\nStatus: Upcoming New Series\nSeries Premiere: June 23, 2013\nClassification: Scripted\nGenre: Drama\nNetwork: Lifetime (USA)\nAirs: Sundays at 10:00 pm\nRuntime: 60 Minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32711ba528fb13b9fa15c2509b4e7f89d220bf0","amp;dn":"Devious.Maids.S01E01.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32711ba528fb13b9fa15c2509b4e7f89d220bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,39,17,186,82,143,177,59,159,161,92,37,9,180,231,248,157,34,11,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
