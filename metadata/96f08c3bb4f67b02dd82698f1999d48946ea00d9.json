At the age of eight, Miranda discovered that her beloved &quot;mummy and daddy&quot; were, in fact, her grandparents, and her real mother was the woman she had always known as her elder sister. Miranda writes honestly about her struggle to accept the trauma of these new family relationships. She details how she became a teenage &quot;wild-child,&quot; experimenting with sexual tastes that, from the start, involved dominating her boyfriend. Unable to cope with this bright but willful teenager, her elderly grandparents were forced to tell her to leave, and at just 16 Miranda was homeless and penniless. To fund her studies she first became a teenage receptionist for &quot;working-girls,&quot; but soon realized that her own sexual tastes were well-suited to satisfy a vast demand from submissive men. Here, Miranda relays the tales of the men, women, and couples who have visited her extensive dungeon chambers over the past two decades for fetish fun. This is not a book about sex for money; but about work that is a mixture of fetish fashion, complex psychological role-play, bondage, and domination.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f08c3bb4f67b02dd82698f1999d48946ea00d9","amp;dn":"Fifty+Shades+of+Domination-+Mistress+Miranda+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f08c3bb4f67b02dd82698f1999d48946ea00d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,240,140,59,180,246,123,2,221,130,105,143,25,153,212,137,70,234,0,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
