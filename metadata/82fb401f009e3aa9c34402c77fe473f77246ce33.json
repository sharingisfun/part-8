But within 2 years of their formation, Iron Maiden had spearheaded what came to be abbreviated the NWOBHM, and as with punk the years before, a new generation of performers, musicians and show-offs in general bought in a new wave of the rock genre - and in the process made loud, raw, heavy music the global phenomenon it is today.\n\nFor the first time this film investigates the New Wave - the bands, the records, the media and the series of unconnected events that led to the unfolding of this astonishing, durable and still hugely relevant form - which is head even today on so many new records. Focusing on Maiden and the other pivotal bands of the time, such as Saxon, Samson, Praying Mantis, Diamond Head, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Grilschool and many others, this programme is the ultimate expose of a style which may not get as much press as punk, but is equally as relevant to the music of the third millennium.      \n\nINFO:  \nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 2.30 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 25mn\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 257 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf52.104.0\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : No\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : 20\nDuration                                 : 2h 25mn\nBit rate                                 : 2 069 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nOriginal display aspect ratio            : 4:3\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nStandard                                 : NTSC\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.200\nStream size                              : 2.11 GiB (92%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 2h 25mn\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 184 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 192 MiB (8%)\n\nIMDb-  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1202233/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1202233/&lt;/a&gt;    \n\nSIZE: 2.29GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82fb401f009e3aa9c34402c77fe473f77246ce33","amp;dn":"IRON+MAIDEN+and+the+New+Wave+of+British+Heavy+Metal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82fb401f009e3aa9c34402c77fe473f77246ce33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,251,64,31,0,158,58,169,195,68,2,199,127,228,115,247,114,70,206,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
