PROTECTION: Ubidrm+Steam\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Action, Adventure\nPlatformer, RPG\n\n20 years after the original game's launch, Conrad is enlisted back to active\nservice for the triumphant return of one of the most acclaimed franchises in\ngaming history\n\nIt's not a reboot. It's Flashback re-imagined. The original Core-Team revamped\ntheir own creation, leveraging the best of today's technology while remaining\ntrue to the classic side-scroller that set the standards of the genre in the\n90's\n\nOne of the best adventure-action games ever created re-imagined by its\ncreators. It's the same team. It's the same passion. Only this time, they have\nhad much more firepower at their disposal to recreate the legendary classic!\n\nGorgeous graphics, amazing animations. It's the Flashback you've always\ndreamed of. True to the original spirit but made a million times better by\nusing modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely\nstunning\n\nIt's all about Gameplay. The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the\ngame more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience\nprogression system. But the developers kept the original formula in mind: a\nfine balance between rolling and shooting, exploring remote space stations and\nobliterating hostile alien planets\n\nBringing back new memories. The story was revamped to speak to 21st century\ngamers. Most of the cast of the original game is still here - Conrad, the\nMorphs - but you can expect new characters and a few twists you're definitely\nnot going to forget... this time\n\n1. Unrar\n2.
