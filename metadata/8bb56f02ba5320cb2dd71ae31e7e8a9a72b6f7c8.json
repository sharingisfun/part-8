Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nPOtHS - Gospel Music - 16 - Canton Spirituals - Live in Memphis - DivX\n\n\nLIVE IN MEMPHIS is the final live recording of Harvey Watkins, Sr. (Dec. 5, 1929 - Nov. 16, 1994).\n\nThe Original Canton Spirituals include: Eddie Jackson, Theo Thompson, Roscoe Lucious, Harvey Watkins, Sr. (vocals).\n\nRecorded live at Greater Community Temple C.O.G.I.C., Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nTop-selling quartet whose roots date back to the late 1940s.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\\\\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n\\\\\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\\\\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nThis is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
