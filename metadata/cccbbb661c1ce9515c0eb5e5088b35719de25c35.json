Guards!'\n\nVictor Gollancz Sf, 2000, 124 pages\n\nWritten by Terry Pratchett\n\nAdapted by Stephen Briggs\n\nIllustrated by Graham Higgins\n\nThis is a Discworld novel, I'm not sure where it falls in the overall order of the adapted graphic novels.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm uploading three Terry Pratchett graphic novels, all of which, for whatever reason, vary in quality from a visual standpoint. Honestly, none of them look particularly brilliant, but I never upload anything that I don't think is worth taking the time to view/read, so take my over critical opinions with a grain of salt.\n\nThis one looks pretty good. Still not perfect, but nothing that makes me think I need to mention it before somebody downloads it.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cccbbb661c1ce9515c0eb5e5088b35719de25c35","amp;dn":"Terry+Pratchett+-+Guards+Guards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cccbbb661c1ce9515c0eb5e5088b35719de25c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,203,187,102,28,28,233,81,92,14,181,229,8,139,53,113,157,226,92,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
