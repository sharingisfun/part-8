Ken Smith Landscape Architects/Urban Projects focuses on three prominent works in New York City: his East River Project; his work for P.S. 19; and his MoMA rooftop garden. Through Smith's colorful, playful drawings and photographs, the book reveals how each project explores new expressions of landscape design in the city.\n\nKen Smith Landscape Architects/Urban Projects is part of the Source Books in Landscape Architecture series sponsored by Ohio State University. These books present sketches, drawings, models, renderings, working drawings, and photographs. Each book focuses on a recent, important work or works at a level of detail that allows thorough study of the project from its conception to the completion of design and construction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6dae345b84fde9aa9ad137bdd00009da0d2d7b","amp;dn":"Ken+Smith+Landscape+Architects+Urban+Projects+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6dae345b84fde9aa9ad137bdd00009da0d2d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,109,174,52,91,132,253,233,170,154,209,55,189,208,0,9,218,13,45,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
