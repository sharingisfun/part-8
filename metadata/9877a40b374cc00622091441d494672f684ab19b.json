Many thanks to the original scanners for their excellent work.\n\nThese unique digital omnibuses collect the Hickman Fantastic Four and FF runs in 1280 pages split into two volumes, including:\n\nFantastic Four #570-587, #600-611, &amp; #605.1\nFF #1-23\n...presented in the proper reading order as noted by Hickman himself.\n\nAlso included are several articles on the series - including a great interview with Jonathan Hickman - and tons of bonus artwork including full-page cover art and a complete showcase of the Fantastic Four 600 Hero Initiative variants (100+ covers!).\n\nIf you like what you read here, please support the artists and publisher and ensure further works like this by going out and purchasing the back issues from your local retailer, the trade paperbacks or hardcovers, or the digital comics.\n\nThis collection follows these available MiracleScans releases:\n\n- The Complete Fantastic Four by Mark Millar\n- The Complete Seven Soldiers of Victory by Grant Morrison\n- The Complete Miracleman by Alan Moore\n- The Complete Marvelman in Warrior\n\nAll of these releases can be found on Pirate Bay under username &quot;MrclScns&quot;.\n\nMiracleScans specializes in digital omnibus volumes of complex comic runs organized for easy reading, &amp; we also do new scans of older material.
