Formed in 1995, the group was founded by percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in their early days, the band consisted of nine members for the greater part of their tenure: Sid Wilson, Paul Gray, Joey Jordison, Chris Fehn, Jim Root, Craig Jones, Shawn Crahan, Mick Thomson, and Corey Taylor. However, the death of Paul Gray on May 24, 2010, left the band with only eight remaining members. Former guitarist Donnie Steele will be the band's touring bassist in 2011.\n\nSlipknot is well known by their attention-grabbing image, aggressive music style and their energetic and chaotic live shows. The band had somewhat of a meteoric rise to success following the release of their self-titled debut album in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album Iowa further increased the band's popularity. After breaking for their first hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) and once again in 2008 with their fourth album All Hope Is Gone, which debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200. The band has also released one live album and four DVDs. As of May 2010, Slipknot has sold over 14 million records worldwide.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img296.imageshack.us/img296/8508/discografiaslipknotbannwm2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img296.imageshack.us/img296/8508/discografiaslipknotbannwm2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nMate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. - 1996\nSlipknot - 1999\nIowa - 2001\nVol. 3: The Subliminal Verses - 2004\n9.0: Live - 2005\n\nIncluding all demo CD obtained from the American band, the promo version of Before I Forget, Duality, Hate, Heretic Song Rough Mix, Pulse of the Maggots, Scream and The Subliminal Verses Tour, demos of 1992 and 1998 and live performances at Big Day Out 2005, Rock Am Ring 2005 and Download Festival 2004.\n\nIn total there are 30 albums (triple version of &quot;Slipknot&quot; and two versions of &quot;Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8341de7587db20fe120a1ffddad176cc491898","amp;dn":"Slipknot+-+Discography+1996-2005+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8341de7587db20fe120a1ffddad176cc491898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,131,65,222,117,135,219,32,254,18,10,31,253,218,209,118,204,73,24,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
