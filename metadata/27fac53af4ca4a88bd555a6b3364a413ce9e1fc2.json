Marks; 1983)\n\nWhat is the CIA really up to? What does it do, and why? No other element of the U.S. government is so lapped in mystery, no other is quite so plainly self-willed and independently powerful. And in the end, no other represents quite such a threat to our long-treasured democratic principles.\nThere have been many books about the CIA, but never before has there been one that laid bare the facts so explicitly and with such absolute authority. Victor Marchetti spent 14 years in the CIA, much of the time as a high-ranking officer. Co-author John Marks learned about the agency and intelligence procedures while working in the State Department. Their experience and knowledge give The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence its authenticity and make incontestable its basic thesis: that an obsession with clandestine operationsÃ¢â‚¬â€illegal, even immoral interference in the internal affairs of other countries (and in some recent cases, our own)Ã¢â‚¬â€has largely supplanted the agency's original and proper missionÃ¢â‚¬â€the overall supervision, coordination, and processing of intelligence.\nMany of the details reported for the first time in this book will surprise and probably shock: how, with tactics that included bombing runs by its own B-26s, the agency tried to overthrow Sukarno in 1958; how it conducted paramilitary operations against the Chinese in Tibet; its ownership and management of &quot;proprietary organizations&quot; ranging from airlines to radio stationsÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes for profit; the fact that at least one CIA guerrilla PT boat unit was on hand the night of the famous Tonkin Gulf incident; how the CIA secretly built &quot;a miniature Ft. Bragg&quot; in the Peruvian jungle, and its role in the search for Che Guevara in Bolivia; and more. What surprises remain hidden in the sections censored out?\n\nAlso check out my other torrent: Books about CIA - Marchetti, Blum, Agee, Prouty, etc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fac53af4ca4a88bd555a6b3364a413ce9e1fc2","amp;dn":"The+CIA+and+The+Cult+of+Intelligence+-+Victor+Marchetti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fac53af4ca4a88bd555a6b3364a413ce9e1fc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,250,197,58,244,202,74,136,189,85,90,107,51,100,164,19,206,158,31,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
