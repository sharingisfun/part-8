Even as technology exerts new pressures to speed up our lives, it turns out that the choices we makeÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œunconsciously and consciously, in time frames varying from milliseconds to yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œbenefit profoundly from delay. As this winning and provocative book reveals, taking control of time and slowing down our responses yields better results in almost every arena of life Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ even when time seems to be of the essence.\n\nThe procrastinator in all of us will delight in PartnoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accounts of celebrity Ã¢â‚¬Å“delay specialists,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Warren Buffett to Chris Evert to Steve Kroft, underscoring the myriad ways in which delaying our reactions to everyday choicesÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œlarge and smallÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œcan improve the quality of our lives.
