Featuring guest production from the likes of Timbaland and Stargate, the album sees Rihanna go for a more up tempo sound while keeping her soulful edge. Guest vocals come from the likes of Justin Timberlake, label mate Ne-Yo, Timbaland and Jay-Z. The single &amp;#039;Umbrella&amp;#039; is also included, together with the UK bonus track &amp;#039;Cry&amp;#039;.\n\nThis album has a different feel from her other albums, maybe a bit more mature and even angry sounding sometimes. She mixes her great ballads and upbeat caribbean beat together for most of the time, to create exotic and emotional songs.\n\n[b]Tracks:[/b]\n01  Umbrella [Feat.
