A similar eclecticism and scope also surfaced in his solo work, which couched his charmingly gravelly voice in a rustic yet rich swamp pop fusion of country, blues, and gospel. Born Claude Russell Bridges on April 2, 1942, in Lawton, OK, he began studying classical piano at age three, a decade later adopting the trumpet and forming his first band. At 14, Russell lied about his age to land a gig at a Tulsa nightclub, playing behind Ronnie Hawkins &amp; the Hawks before touring in support of Jerry Lee Lewis. Two years later, he settled in Los Angeles, studying guitar under the legendary James Burton and appearing on sessions with Dorsey Burnette and Glen Campbell. As a member of Spector's renowned studio group, Russell played on many of the finest pop singles of the 1960s, also arranging classics like Ike &amp; Tina Turner's monumental &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot;; other hits bearing his input include the Byrds' &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys' &quot;This Diamond Ring,&quot; and Herb Alpert's &quot;A Taste of Honey.&quot; ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:0ifwxqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nOf all Russell's early work as an artist, this record is the weakest; in particular, songs like &quot;Tryin' to Stay Live&quot; and &quot;When You Wish Upon a Fag&quot; feel dated. Nevertheless, Asylum Choir II is still a pretty nice record. Especially noteworthy is Russell's own version of &quot;Hello, Little Friend&quot;; Joe Cocker would later record the definitive version of the song. (The 1995 CD reissue features five bonus tracks).\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. Sweet Home Chicago\n02. Down On The Base\n03. Hello Little Friend\n04. Salty Candy\n05.
