Fast forward to \n           2010, and the President then tells the entire    \n           planet that the world is ending. This begins a   \n           state of panic and widespread decay of humanity  \n           as the Earth itself begins to fall apart forever.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy nehalkhalid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bada217a624cb4f47fc63ee9c27504e4207282e7","amp;dn":"2012+%5B2009%5D+Dual+Audio.Hindi-Eng.DVDRip+-1CD-nEHAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bada217a624cb4f47fc63ee9c27504e4207282e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,218,33,122,98,76,180,244,127,198,62,233,194,117,4,228,32,114,130,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
