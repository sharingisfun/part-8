The world is in chaos: violence is rife, nightmares everywhere. Jorg's bleak past has set him beyond fear of any man, living or dead, but there is still one thing that puts a chill in him. Returning to his father's castle Jorg must confront horrors from his childhood and carve himself a future with all hands turned against him.\n\nBook Two- King of Thorns: To reach greatness you must step on bodies, and many brothers lie trodden in my wake. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve walked from pawn to player and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll win this game of ours, though the cost of it may drown the world in bloodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe land burns with the fires of a hundred battles as lords and petty kings fight for the Broken Empire. The long road to avenge the slaughter of his mother and brother has shown Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath the hidden hands behind this endless war. He saw the game and vowed to sweep the board. First though he must gather his own pieces, learn the rules of play, and discover how to break them.\n\nA six nation army, twenty thousand strong, marches toward Jorg's gates, led by a champion beloved of the people. Every decent man prays this shining hero will unite the empire and heal its wounds. Every omen says he will. Every good king knows to bend the knee in the face of overwhelming odds, if only to save their people and their lands. But King Jorg is not a good king.\n\nFaced by an enemy many times his strength Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight. But playing fair was never part of JorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game plan\n\nBook Three- Emperor of Thorns: To reach the throne requires that a man journey. Even a path paved with good intentions can lead to hell, and my intentions were never good.\n\nThe Hundred converge for Congression to politic upon the corpse of Empire, and while they talk the Dead King makes his move, and I make mine. The world is cracked, time has run through, leaving us clutching at the end days, the future so bright that those who see it are the first to burn. These are the days that have waited for us all our lives. These are my days. I will stand before the Hundred and they will listen. I will take the throne whoever seeks to thwart me, living or dead, and if I must be the last emperor then I will make of it such an ending.\n\nThis is where the wise man turns away. This is where the holy kneel and call on God. These are the last miles, my brothers. Don't look to me to save you. Don't think I will not spend you. Run if you have the wit. Pray if you have the soul. Stand your ground if courage is yours. But don't follow me.\n\nFollow me, and I will break your heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2bacf3c592cdbfd6a79384eaf193b4ebfb9d773","amp;dn":"The+Broken+Empire+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2bacf3c592cdbfd6a79384eaf193b4ebfb9d773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,186,207,60,89,44,219,253,106,121,56,78,175,25,59,78,191,185,215,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
