She works as a house cleaner in an upper-class residence and is struggling financially, yearning for a piano she cannot afford.\n\nAs their lives intertwine, they discover each other's talents and push one another to realise what each had only dreamt about before. Once is the inspiring story of their budding love for one another.\n---------------------------------------\nTechnical Details\n---------------------------------------\nDirector John Carney\nYear 2007\nScreen 16:9 Anamorphic\nLanguages English - Dolby (2.0) Stereo\nDuration 1 Hour and 25 Minutes (approx)\n---------------------------------------\nSpecial Features / Extras\n---------------------------------------\nCommentary with writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and MarkÃƒÂ©ta IrglovÃƒÂ¡\n Musical commentary with writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and MarkÃƒÂ©ta IrglovÃƒÂ¡ \n2 featurettes: 'Making a modern day musical' and 'More guy, more girl'.\n Icon trailer reel\n---------------------------------------\nActors\n---------------------------------------\nGlen Hansard Marketa Irglova Catherine Hansard Kate Haugh Senan Haugh Darren Healy Gerard Hendrick Bill Hodnett Alaistair Foley Danuse Ktrestova \n---------------------------------------\nGenre\n---------------------------------------\nDrama\n---------------------------------------\nLabel\n---------------------------------------\nOnce [2007 PAL AVI File Format]\n---------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:267f8f7256bf6880adac0401c14f0190dee3d354","amp;dn":"Once+2007+PAL+AVI+Format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"267f8f7256bf6880adac0401c14f0190dee3d354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,127,143,114,86,191,104,128,173,172,4,1,193,79,1,144,222,227,211,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
