Originally it was a bi-monthly club newsletter,\nbefore going monthly when the CPC664 was released in 1985. It was \npublished until 1992, when it relaunched as CPC Attack (available as a\nseparate download).\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on\nwwwcpcwikieu . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying\n- this should prove very useful for the Amstrad archivist who'd like to\nhave their own local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF\nreaders, including the iPad.\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check \nretropdfswordpresscom for more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(wwwworldofspectrumorg), and Gryzon for the equally wonderful \nwwwcpcwikieu. \n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)\n\nKen D\nfabwhack [at] gmailcom\nretropdfswordpresscom\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b8b82781a8aed27b2889e18d3c5659359e628b","amp;dn":"Amstrad+Computer+User+Magazine+complete+OCR%5C%27d+PDFs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b8b82781a8aed27b2889e18d3c5659359e628b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,184,184,39,129,168,174,210,123,40,137,225,141,60,86,89,53,158,98,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
