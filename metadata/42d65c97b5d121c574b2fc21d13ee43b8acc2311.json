This time he goes on a trip around America, undertaking missions in major cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Los Angeles and other exotic locations. This time, he better watch his back, as his long-time employer, the International Contract Agency, is threatened by a mysterious rival. \n\nGameplay in Hitman: Blood Money is generally similar to the previous installments. Once again, your job will be to complete several assassination missions. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from &quot;Mass Murderer&quot; up to the coveted &quot;Silent Assassin&quot;. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOnly use DVD Decrypter or Imgburn to burn with respected media.\n\n\nIf using DVD Decrypter make sure Layer Break (For DL Media) is at 1913760 user specified option.
