The series centers around a four-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original Daniel Striped Tiger. Other characters include Katerina Kittycat, O the Owl, and Prince Wednesday. Two 11-minute episodes are linked by a common socio-emotional theme, such as disappointment, sadness or anger. The theme also uses a Musical Motif phrase to reenforce the theme and help children remember. The series is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company (formerly Family Communications) and Out of the Blue Enterprises, with animation produced in Canada by 9 Story Entertainment.\t\n\nHere's the final batch of first season episodes, encoded by me from recordings off my local PBS station. This pack contains all of the episodes that aired in Jan-Feb 2014. The show has been renewed for a second season, which will start airing in Fall 2014. \n\nIf you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment!

If people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c02302a75c30c8df1bd2f849f3fbde756f2d36b4","amp;dn":"Daniel+Tiger%27s+Neighborhood+%28PBS+Kids%29+S1%2C+Eps+35-40+%5BNanto%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c02302a75c30c8df1bd2f849f3fbde756f2d36b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,35,2,167,92,48,200,223,27,210,248,73,243,251,222,117,111,45,54,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
