They can&amp;#039;t find another job. About that time, two things happen: he gets a letter from a wealthy former lover who offers to take care of him (but she doesn&amp;#039;t sign her real name, so Leon, an inveterate Casanova, has no idea who she is), and a group of angry cuckolds, all of whom have surprised their wives in flagrante delicto with Leon (who has a distinctive tattoo on his booty), are closing in, armed and dangerous. Can he find the sugar mommy and escape the wrath of the mob of husbands? What about Julie?\n\n \n Remeber 2 SEED!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6993439e50c4c4b7d5143bada7abb09266d89faf","amp;dn":"The+Ladies+Man.2000.DVDRip.XviD.SWESUB+-+JESS++++-COMEDY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6993439e50c4c4b7d5143bada7abb09266d89faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,147,67,158,80,196,196,183,213,20,59,173,167,171,176,146,102,216,159,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
