This important volume explores not only depersonalization, but the philosophical and literary implications of selflessness as well, while providing the latest research, possible treatments, and strategies for living and thriving when life seems 'unreal.' For those who still believe that such experiences are still a part of something else, that depersonalization is just a symptom and not a disorder in its own right, Feeling Unreal presents compelling evidence to the contrary. This book provides long-awaited answers for people suffering from depersonalization disorder and their loved ones, for mental health professionals, and for all students of the condition, while serving as a wake up call to the medical community at large.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32b581b388c8ebb6ba60e4220ab6b89b5010720","amp;dn":"Feeling+Unreal%3A+Depersonalization+Disorder+and+the+Loss+of+the+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32b581b388c8ebb6ba60e4220ab6b89b5010720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,43,88,27,56,140,142,187,107,166,14,66,32,171,107,137,181,1,7,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
