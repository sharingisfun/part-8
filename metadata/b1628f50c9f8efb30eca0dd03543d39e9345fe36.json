Disc one contains the concert which has been specially upgraded and extended from the existing 1989 longform VHS release to include three previously unreleased encores: &quot;Running Free&quot;, &quot;Run To The Hills&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, thereby completing the full concert with a total running time of 110 minutes . Disc two is an extensive bonus disc featuring an exclusive documentary charting Part 3 in the History of Iron Maiden. This 40-minute film comprises recent interviews with the five band members and manager, Rod Smallwood. Picking up the story in the aftermath of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ84/85 World Slavery tour, this interesting and insightful documentary sees the band speak candidly about their memories of an exciting and occasionally turbulent period from which would emerge the albums Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. As the Eighties began to draw to a close, so did another chapter in MaidenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compelling history.\n\nDVD1:\nMaiden England Ã¢â‚¬â„¢88:\n01. Moonchild\n02. The Evil That Men Do\n03.
