Stepto (Introduction) Frederick Douglass (Author)\nPaperback\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (April 15, 2009)\nASIN: B0085ANZWW\nISBN: 9780674034013\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nA masterpiece of African American literature, Frederick Douglass's Narrative is the powerful story of an enslaved youth coming into social and moral consciousness by disobeying his white slave masters and secretly teaching himself to read. Achieving literacy emboldens Douglass to resist, escape, and ultimately achieve his freedom. After escaping slavery, Douglass became a leader in the anti-slavery and womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights movements, a bestselling author, and U.S. diplomat.\nIn this new critical edition, legendary activist and feminist scholar Angela Davis sheds new light on the legacy of Frederick Douglass. In two philosophical lectures originally delivered at UCLA in autumn 1969, Davis focuses on DouglassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intellectual and spiritual awakening, and the importance of self-knowledge in achieving freedom from all forms of oppression. With detailed attention to DouglassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s text, she interrogates the legacy of slavery and shares timeless lessons about oppression, resistance, and freedom. And in an extended introductory essay written for this edition, Davis comments on previous editions of the Narrative and re-examines Douglass through a contemporary feminist perspective. An important new edition of an American classic.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom School Library Journal\nGrade 9 Up-This classic text in both American literature and American history is read by Pete Papageorge with deliberation and simplicity, allowing the author's words to bridge more than 160 years to today's listeners. Following a stirring preface by William Lloyd Garrison (who, nearly 20 years after he first met Douglass, would himself lead the black troops fighting from the North in the Civil War), the not-yet-30-year-old author recounts his life's story, showing effective and evocative use of language as well as unflinchingly examining many aspects of the Peculiar Institution of American Slavery. Douglass attributes his road to freedom as beginning with his being sent from the Maryland plantation of his birth to live in Baltimore as a young boy. There, he learned to read and, more importantly, learned the power of literacy. In early adolescence, he was returned to farm work, suffered abuse at the hands of cruel overseers, and witnessed abuse visited on fellow slaves. He shared his knowledge of reading with a secret &quot;Sunday school&quot; of 40 fellow slaves during his last years of bondage. In his early 20's, he ran away to the North and found refuge among New England abolitionists. Douglass, a reputed orator, combines concrete description of his circumstances with his own emerging analysis of slavery as a condition. This recording makes his rich work available to those who might feel encumbered by the printed page and belongs as an alternative in all school and public library collections.\nFrancisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA\nCopyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Just as Douglass was dedicated to abolishing the institution that imprisoned him and his people, Davis is dedicated to abolishing the institution that imprisoned her and still imprisons millions of Americans, mostly people of color: the modern American prison system.&quot; -- H. Bruce Franklin, African American\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description II\nDouglass escaped slavery in 1838 and became a tireless campaigner for abolitionism.
