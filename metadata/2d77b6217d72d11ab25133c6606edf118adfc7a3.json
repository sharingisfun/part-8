The two heavyweights are expected to be fighting it out for the title come the end of the season. City may have won the league last season but they were beaten both home and away to Chelsea. Leicester City welcome Manchester United to the King Power Stadium, still looking for a first home win against them since they moved to the ground in 2002. The Foxes' last home victory over United was a 3-0 triumph in 1985. Everton take on Crystal Palace in the day's other game. The Eagles proved a tough nut to crack for Roberto Martinez's side last season, taking four points off them. Mark and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's matches.\n\nNo spoilers please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d77b6217d72d11ab25133c6606edf118adfc7a3","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-+21st+September+2014+-+HDTV+X264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d77b6217d72d11ab25133c6606edf118adfc7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,119,182,33,125,114,209,26,178,81,51,198,96,110,223,17,138,223,199,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
