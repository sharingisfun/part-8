He has so much to say that it takes two horns (and a lot of fast-moving licks) to do it. In some cases, he switches between alto and tenor on the same tune. Overall, this album is a joyous outpouring of inspired playing by one of the most competent and confident saxophonists of his time, backed up by a solid three-man rhythm section. \nThe 10 tracks, totaling 46 minutes, offer a nice selection of blues riffs and jazz standards, including &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; a requirement in every jazz saxophonist's repertoire. The fast-paced tunes are a great adrenalin rush, but there's also plenty of pent-up energy occasionally bursting to the surface in the slow tunes. This is a very satisfying listening experience for sax lovers, and a humbling one for sax players. ~ James A. Vedda\n\nSonny Stitt may not be the most adventurous, the most unpredictable, the best saxophonist of all time, but he certainly is the most perfect. No one plays with more impeccable logic, executes with better technique or offers a truer sound--at once pure and direct and rich, warm and soulful. And he manages to maintain this perfection despite being listed as a leader on no fewer than 150 separate recording sessions (albums, not tracks)! He may not be the omega of saxophonists, but he should be considered the alpha by anyone who hopes to play the instrument.\nOne of the big myths among even those players who respect Sonny's playing is that his so-called &quot;popular&quot; recordings--the early Roosts and Verves on which he turns in 5-6 flawless gems on each side of the record--can be overlooked in favor of his earlier pairings with Diz and Rollins or his later virtuosic work on Muse. On the contrary, it's on these miniature performances where Sonny's unique genius is especially apparent. Allowing himself no more than a couple of choruses he still manages to construct logically complete, emotionally satisfying solos with a beginning, middle, and end, time and time again. Just listen to what he does with &quot;Alone Together&quot;--first on tenor, then switching horns and taking the tune out with another textbook solo on alto.\n\nThis reissue is especially welcome because it complements Sonny with an ideal rhythm section. Jo Jones was the prototypal straightahead swinging drummer during his Basie tenure; Jimmy Jones was always the self-effacing accompanist for Sarah Vaughan, and Ray Brown could be whatever the occasion demanded. All three merely lay down a harmonic/rhythmic track and stay out of Sonny's way--as it should be. ~ Samuel Chell\n\nPersonnel:\nSonny Stitt (alto saxophone, tenor saxophone)\nJimmy Jones (piano)\nRay Brown (bass)\nJo Jones (drums)\n\nSonny Stitt - New York Jazz Tracks:\n01  Norman's Blues\n02  I Know That You Know\n03  If I Had You\n04  Alone Together\n05  Twelfth Street Rag\n06  Down Home Blues\n07  Sonny's Tune\n08  Stars Fell on Alabama\n09  Body and Soul\n10  Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b15343d4a8ae5721a80788bb5e0ce75ed3480e66","amp;dn":"Sonny+Stitt+-+New+York+Jazz+%281956%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b15343d4a8ae5721a80788bb5e0ce75ed3480e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,83,67,212,168,174,87,33,168,7,136,187,94,12,231,94,211,72,14,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
