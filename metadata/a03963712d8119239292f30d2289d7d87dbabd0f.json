Charlton Heston is Robert Neville, the sole recipient of a serum that enabled him to survive an onslaught of germ warfare between Russia and China - which seemingly rendered him the last \\&quot;normal\\&quot; human alive. Neville lives in a garnish, antique strewn L.A. penthouse. During the day, he roams through the vacatn city. At night, he fends off a bloodthirsty horde of mutant scavengers garbed in Spanish inquisition robes and sunglasses, led by Matthias, a former television newscaster in his good ol\\&amp;#039; premutant days. Matthias and his half-human vampires want to kill Neville. Neville\\&amp;#039;s last man on Earth status is shattered when he comes across a group of young people, presided over by a sexy and cynical Lisa.\n\nCodec: XviD\n\nAudio: English\n\nAspect ratio: 640x272 (Widescreen)\n\nRipped &amp; encoded tonight by request. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a03963712d8119239292f30d2289d7d87dbabd0f","amp;dn":"The.Omega.Man.1971.XviD.DvdRip-NightSongz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a03963712d8119239292f30d2289d7d87dbabd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,57,99,113,45,129,25,35,146,146,243,13,34,137,215,216,125,186,189,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
