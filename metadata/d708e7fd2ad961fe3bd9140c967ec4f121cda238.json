The etiology of the patient's symptoms may be life-threatening, that is, when headache is due to subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis, or life-altering, that is, when back pain or weakness is due to spinal cord compression, if not diagnosed and treated urgently. This is a comprehensive textbook of the disorders that are neurological emergencies, including their differential diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment. Designed for any practitioner who makes time-sensitive decisions, Emergency Neurology is an indispensable, one-stop resource to aid your clinical decision-making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d708e7fd2ad961fe3bd9140c967ec4f121cda238","amp;dn":"Emergency+Neurology+%28Springer%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d708e7fd2ad961fe3bd9140c967ec4f121cda238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,8,231,253,42,217,97,254,59,217,20,12,150,126,196,241,33,205,162,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
