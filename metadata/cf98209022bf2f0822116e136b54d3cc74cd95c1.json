Now, following a Kickstarter campaign and some festival screenings, the film, written and directed by Murdoch, and its soundtrack finally have a proper theatrical release date.\n\nIn North America, the film will be released September 5 in theaters and on demand via Amplify. In the UK, the film is out August 16 via Metrodrome. God Help the Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is out August 18 in the UK and September 2 in North America via Milan.\n\nThe soundtrack features three new songs by Murdoch, which are sung by the film's cast: &quot;Pretty When the Wind Blows&quot;, &quot;I Dumped You First&quot;, and &quot;I'm Not Rich&quot;. The other songs are re-recorded or remixed versions of the album's tracks performed by the cast. It also features the original version of Belle and Sebastian's &quot;Dress Up in You&quot;, plus dialogue and bits of score from the film.\n\nThe film stars Emily Browning, Olly Alexander, and Hannah Murray; it was produced by Barry Mendel (Rushmore, Bridesmaids).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf98209022bf2f0822116e136b54d3cc74cd95c1","amp;dn":"+God+Help+the+Girl+%28Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack%29+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf98209022bf2f0822116e136b54d3cc74cd95c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,152,32,144,34,191,47,8,34,17,110,19,107,84,211,204,116,205,149,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
