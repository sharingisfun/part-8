I find the acting to be very mannered, but the story keeps our interest. The very real conflict felt by the title character makes us sympathetic towards what could have been a cardboard character.  Shaw takes numerous opportunities to expound his social ideas, but Barbara herself is the main point of interest.\n\nIn segmented mpg format - will play on VLC player.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8331900e757e9126c1fe98b49f30b710e0828ddc","amp;dn":"Major+Barbara+%281941%29+Bernard+Shaw++Rex+Harrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8331900e757e9126c1fe98b49f30b710e0828ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,49,144,14,117,126,145,38,193,254,152,180,159,48,183,16,224,130,141,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
