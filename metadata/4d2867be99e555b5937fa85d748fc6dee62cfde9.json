Your device must be rooted to be able to use Mobile ODIN. Check the list below to see if your device is supported !\n\nIf you use the EverRoot option, Mobile ODIN will root the firmware while you flash it. Checking out that new leaked firmware? No reason to lose root!\n\nFlashing with Mobile ODIN is easy. You start by starting the app and the app will check your system has everything it needs to continue (like root). It may need to download an additional package, so it is advised you have Wi-Fi available.\n\nNow you should see the main Mobile ODIN screen. It will list a set of partitions. Clicking a partition will allow you to select a file from your SD card to flash to that partition. Do not worry about selecting the wrong file - Mobile ODIN will not let you. Separate files (named after the partition) as well as .tar and .tar.md5 files are supported.\n\nFrom the desktop ODIN you may be used to &quot;PDA&quot;, &quot;PHONE&quot;, and &quot;CSC&quot; buttons. All three of these buttons have been replaced by the &quot;Open file ...&quot; button. This button will open the file you select from the SD card, and find all the partitions it can flash inside that file. So if you select a .tar file containing kernel and modem, the Kernel and Modem partitions will be set up to use that .tar file for flashing.\n\nNow that we have selected what we want to flash, if you have the Pro version you can proceed to the EverRoot section. The EverRoot options allows you to root your firmware while it is being flashed. Never again will you be without root! Select here which apps you want to inject in the firmware that is being flashed.\n\nNow that we are all done selecting partitions and configuring EverRoot, we continue to &quot;Flash firmware&quot;. Mobile ODIN will gather all the information it needs and perform the flash. Before starting, however, it will check that your battery level is over 50%, and if applicable offer to verify MD5 checksums on the files you have selected to flash. If all is well, it will reboot into recovery mode, and flash the firmware you have selected.\n\nSupported Devices\nSamsung Galaxy S GT-I9000/B/M\nSamsung Galaxy S GT-I9003/L\nAT&amp;T/Rogers Captivate SGH-I896/I897\nSamsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100/T/G/m\nSamsung Galaxy S2 SHW-M250S/K\nSamsung Galaxy S2 SC-02C\nAT&amp;T Galaxy S2 SGH-I777\nSprint/Virgin/Boost Epic 4G Touch SPH-D710/VMUB/BST\nUSCC Galaxy S2 SCH-R760\nSamsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300/T\nSamsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9308\nAT&amp;T/Canadia Galaxy S3 SGH-I747/M\nTMOUS Galaxy S3 SGH-T999\nSprint/C-Spire Galaxy S3 SPH/SCH-L710\nVZW Galaxy S3 SCH-I535 (unlock bootloader !)\nUSCC/Cricket/MetroPCS Galaxy S3 SCH-R530/U/M/C\nSamsung Galaxy S3 LTE SHV-E210S\nSamsung Galaxy S3 LTE GT-I9305/T/N\nGoogle Galaxy Nexus (GSM) Maguro/Yakju/GT-I9250\nGoogle Galaxy Nexus (CDMA/LTE) Toro/Mysid/SCH-I515 (no cdma radio flashing)\nSamsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000\nSamsung Galaxy Note GT-I9220\nSamsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000B\nSamsung Galaxy Note 2 GT-N7100\nSamsung Galaxy Note 2 LTE GT-N7105\nAT&amp;T/Canadia Galaxy Note 2 SGH-I317/M\nTMOUS Galaxy Note 2 SGH-T889\nSprint Galaxy Note 2 SPH-L900\nVZW Galaxy Note 2 SCH-I605 (unlock bootloader !)\nUSCC Galaxy Note 2 SCH-R950\nSamsung Galaxy Note 10.1&quot; GT-N8000 \nSamsung Galaxy Note 10.1&quot; Wi-Fi GT-N8010/N8013\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 7&quot; GT-P1000\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus GT-P6200/L, GT-P6210\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 7.7&quot; GT-P6800, GT-P6810\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 10.1&quot; GT-P7500, GT-P7510\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 7&quot; GT-P3100, GT-P3110, GT-P3113\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 10&quot; GT-P5100, GT-P5110, GT-P5113\nSamsung Galaxy 5 GT-I5500/B/L/T/M\nSamsung Galaxy 5 GT-I5503/T\nSamsung Galaxy 5 GT-I5508\nFlashing with Mobile ODIN does NOT increase your custom kernel flash counter or make the yellow warning triangle appear.\n\nWhat's New\nUpdated: SuperSU v1.94\nUpdated: Support for:\nSamsung Galaxy S5\nInternational SM-G900F\nOceania SM-G900I\nKorea SM-G900L\nMiddle and South America SM-G900M\nSprint SM-G900P\nS Cellular SM-G900R4\nT-Mobile US SM-G900T\nMetro PCS SM-G900T1\nCanadia SM-G900W8\n\n\nUSE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK\n\nPLEASE SEED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d2867be99e555b5937fa85d748fc6dee62cfde9","amp;dn":"Mobile+ODIN+v4.20%28AnDrOid%29.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d2867be99e555b5937fa85d748fc6dee62cfde9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,40,103,190,153,229,85,181,147,127,168,93,116,143,198,222,230,44,253,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
