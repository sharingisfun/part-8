Sabah, &quot;Electric Circuits and Signals&quot;\n\nISBN: 142004589X | 2008 | PDF | 896 pages | 69 MB\n\n\nSolving circuit problems is less a matter of knowing what steps to follow than why those steps are necessary. And knowing the why stems from an in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts and theoretical basis of electric circuits. Setting the benchmark for a modern approach to this fundamental topic, Nassir SabahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Electric Circuits and Signals supplies a comprehensive, intuitive, conceptual, and hands-on introduction with an emphasis on creative problem solving.\n\nIdeal for electrical engineering majors as a first step, this phenomenal textbook also builds a core knowledge in the basic theory, concepts, and techniques of circuit analysis, behavior, and operation for students following tracks in such areas as computer engineering, communications engineering, electronics, mechatronics, electric power, and control systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd5424f17f3489482ae311c898e3c6d9ecdc0d0","amp;dn":"Electric+Circuits+and+Signals+Nassir+H.+Sabah+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bd5424f17f3489482ae311c898e3c6d9ecdc0d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,213,66,79,23,243,72,148,130,174,49,28,137,142,60,109,158,205,192,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
