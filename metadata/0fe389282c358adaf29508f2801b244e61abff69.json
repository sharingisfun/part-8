The series is set several years after the original strips.  Space Fleet has collapsed along with the UN due to nuclear war between China and America; Britain survived due to defensive shields made by Professor Peabody, and has become a world power again as a result with the Royal Navy taking Space Fleet's role.  Peabody is the Home Secretary to a Prime Minister modelled on Tony Blair, who has sold Earth's defence out to The Mekon out of fear of overwhelming odds.  Dare leads a spirited defence of both Earth and his honourable principles.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe389282c358adaf29508f2801b244e61abff69","amp;dn":"Dan+Dare+%28Virgin+2007%29+Complete+with+FCBD+one+shot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe389282c358adaf29508f2801b244e61abff69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,227,137,40,44,53,138,218,242,149,8,242,128,27,36,78,97,171,255,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
