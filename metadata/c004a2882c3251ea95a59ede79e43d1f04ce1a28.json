We can hardly contain our excitement about Dave's Picks Volume 6. The first major return of material to the vault since 2005's Houseboat Tapes, Dave's Picks Volume 6 will feature 2 complete shows with never-before-heard material from 2/2/70 Fox Theater, St. Louis, MO and 12/20/69 Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, CA. Long a mystery, the riddle of the 2/2/70 set list has now been solved and the music restored to its proper - and spectacular - sequence. 2/2/70 is also notable as the first show without Tom Constanten. Tom, however, makes his return to give his first-hand perspective on 12/20/69 in this volume's liner notes.Pigpen fiends, ask and you shall receive. Both shows feature loads of Pigpen including a major 35+ minute &quot;Lovelight&quot; from 12/20/69. Recorded by Bear with an excellent mix and sound quality, this very special release feels like a return to the classics.
