The story puts you on a quite \npeculiar space ship, full of convicted \nprisoners, that got trapped inside a cosmic \nanomaly known as Black Nebula. Playing \nrole of a tough warrior you will be \nstruggling to reach an emergency \ntransporting module, hacking and slashing \nyour way through hordes of alien creatures \ntaking over your ship.\n\nPros\n\n* 45 levels scattered throughout a variety of Earth-like biospheres\n* 80-100 hours of gameplay\n* A wide assortment of equipment including 40 different melee and shooting weapons, 13 hi-tech items, and 45 bio chips to enhance your hero\n* 3-D graphics are rather nice and the ability to rotate the camera makes it easy to view the terrain\n\nCons\n\n* Combat can get repetitive and less satisfying as you fight the same aliens over and over\n* The pace seems awkward with level progression and item requirements, such as needing 45 strength to use a good sword\n* Lack of meaningful audio for characters, story unfolds through text boxes which lessens feeling of immersion\n\n\n\nPublisher: Meridian4\nDeveloper: Rebelmind\nGenre: Action/RPG\nRelease Date: Nov 18, 2005\nESRB: Teen\nESRB Descriptors: Language, Fantasy Violence, Blood and Gore\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\nSystem: 1.4 GHz or equivalent\nRAM: 256 MB\nVideo Memory: 32 MB\nHard Drive Space: 500 MB\n\nOfficial WEB Site: http://spacehack.rebelmind.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e96d4f27f955ffc5c3d32741e1fea06e595aa4","amp;dn":"Space+Hack+%283D+sci-fi+Action%2FRPG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e96d4f27f955ffc5c3d32741e1fea06e595aa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,233,109,79,39,249,85,255,197,195,211,39,65,225,254,160,110,89,90,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
