To date, My Dying Bride have released ten full-length studio albums, three EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums, one live album, and one live CD/DVD release.\n\nThe band released their tenth studio album, For Lies I Sire, on March 23, 2009. Along with bands such as Anathema, Paradise Lost, and Katatonia, they are one of the forerunners of the death/doom metal genre. While bands like Paradise Lost and Katatonia have expanded their musical styles beyond doom metal, though Paradise Lost later returned to the genre, My Dying Bride has continued to play doom metal since its foundation.\n\nEvinta. A project almost 15 years in the making. An idea that has sat smoldering and never really had a reason to burn alive until now. 9 albums worth of darkness recreated anew to mark 20 years of MDB.\n\nMusic arranged to the soundscapes of sorrows past. Finally the 20th anniversary allows us to release this music in a form it has been desperately, woefully waiting for. Enjoy the Darkness.&quot;\n\n\n\n`Evinta` [3CD Deluxe Edition 2011]\n\n--- CD1 ---\n01. In Your Dark Pavilion\n02. You Are Not the One Who Loves Me\n03. Of Lilies Bent with Tears\n04.
