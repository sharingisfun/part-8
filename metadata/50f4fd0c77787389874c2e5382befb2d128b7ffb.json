In the first two volumes of his bestselling Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson recounted how the American-led coalition fought through North Africa and Italy to the threshold of victory. Now, in The Guns at Last Light, he tells the most dramatic story of allÃ¢â‚¬â€the titanic battle for Western Europe.\n\nD-Day marked the commencement of the final campaign of the European war, and AtkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riveting account of that bold gamble sets the pace for the masterly narrative that follows. The brutal fight in Normandy, the liberation of Paris, the disaster that was Operation Market Garden, the horrific Battle of the Bulge, and finally the thrust to the heart of the Third ReichÃ¢â‚¬â€all these historic events and more come alive with a wealth of new material and a mesmerizing cast of characters. Atkinson tells the tale from the perspective of participants at every level, from presidents and generals to war-weary lieutenants and terrified teenage riflemen. When Germany at last surrenders, we understand anew both the devastating cost of this global conflagration and the enormous effort required to win the Allied victory.\n\nWith the stirring final volume of this monumental trilogy, AtkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accomplishment is manifest. He has produced the definitive chronicle of the war that unshackled a continent and preserved freedom in the West.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nAdding to the trunkful of extended WWII histories by the likes of Sir Max Hastings, Andrew Roberts, Martin Gilbert, John Keegan, and Norman Davies, Atkinson, winner of two Pulitzers (for An Army at Dawn, the first in the Liberation Trilogy, and for reporting), concludes his series on the war in Europe and North Africa with this superb work. Though lacking an overall theme, the book is distinguished by its astonishing range of coverageÃ¢â‚¬â€peopling the pages are German, British, French, Canadian, and (primarily) American generals and common soldiers. Excerpts from the letters of dead soldiers on both sides, as well as from the diaries of captain generals, fill out the story. Atkinson takes readers through battles large and small, strategy as well as on-the-ground tactics, accompanied by vivid maps (courtesy of Ã¢â‚¬Å“master cartographerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gene Thorp). Drama, the absurd, and the desperately sad weave throughout the narrative. War, Atkinson writes, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“a chaotic, desultory enterprise of reversal and advance, blunder and ÃƒÂ©lan, despair and elation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In his estimation, such was the war for both the victors and the vanquished. His lively, occasionally lyric prose brings the vast theater of battle, from the beaches of Normandy deep into Germany, brilliantly alive. It is hard to imagine a better history of the western frontÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final phase.\n\nThe New York Times Book Review - Ben Macintyre\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a book that stitches a multitude ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦small but telling moments into a tapestry of fabulous richness and complexity. Atkinson is a master of what might be called &quot;pointillism history,&quot; assembling the small dots of pure color into a vivid, tumbling narrativeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦AtkinsonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦knows just when to release the touching, trenchant or horrifying factÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The Liberation Trilogy is a monumental achievement, about 2,500 pages in all, densely researched but supremely readable. Atkinson marshals a vast array of material with aplomb, never losing sight of the grander picture as the troops slog on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f4fd0c77787389874c2e5382befb2d128b7ffb","amp;dn":"Rick+Atkinson+-+The+Guns+at+Last+Light-+The+War+in+Western+Europ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f4fd0c77787389874c2e5382befb2d128b7ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,244,253,12,119,120,115,137,135,76,46,83,130,190,251,45,18,139,127,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
