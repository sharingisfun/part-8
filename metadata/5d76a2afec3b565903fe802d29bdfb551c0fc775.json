Particularly challenging are those patients with pre-existing medical conditions or those receiving medical therapies that may impact the safety and success of their IVF treatments. Prior identification and preparation of the patient at increased risk of complications will enable the clinician to avoid problems in advance, anticipate the necessary management, and optimize outcomes. A new expanded edition of the prize-winning text IVF in the Medically Complicated Patient: A Guide to Management, Second Edition provides a readily accessible, authoritative, and didactic source of information to aid clinicians in this important field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d76a2afec3b565903fe802d29bdfb551c0fc775","amp;dn":"IVF+in+the+Medically+Complicated+Patient%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d76a2afec3b565903fe802d29bdfb551c0fc775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,118,162,175,236,59,86,89,3,254,128,45,41,189,251,85,28,15,199,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
