In this course, Advanced Malware Analysis: Combating Exploit Kits, you'll learn the skills you need to pull apart and analyze exploit kits (an advanced form of malware) with Dr. DeMott. First, you'll explore the tools and techniques you'll be using as well as analyze events collected by Bromium micro-VMs. Next, you'll work on unraveling the exploit kits--figuring out which ones were used, what they look like, how to decrypt them, and how to detect them in &quot;the wild.&quot; Finally, you'll learn how to conduct safe dynamic analysis of these exploit kits, detect CNC communication, and share your analyses so that these problems can be remedied. By the end of this course, you'll not only have a better understanding of what exploit kits are and how to detect them, but you'll be able to analyze how they work and report them so that your data is safer than ever from cyber-crime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1986d032064aff68076a3d66d3040138ac95677","amp;dn":"Advanced+Malware+Analysis%3A+Combating+Exploit+Kits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1986d032064aff68076a3d66d3040138ac95677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,152,109,3,32,100,175,246,128,118,163,214,109,48,64,19,138,201,86,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
