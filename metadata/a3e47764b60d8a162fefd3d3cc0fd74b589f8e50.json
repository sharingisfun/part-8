Lambchop is loosely associated with the alternative country genre, though its music resists easy classification. \nNever a band with a &quot;core&quot; lineup, Lambchop through the years has consisted of a large and fluid collective of musicians focused around its creative centre, frontman Kurt Wagner. Initially indebted to traditional country, the music has subsequently moved through a range of influences including post-rock, soul and lounge music.\nWhatever the style, the characteristic mood of Lambchop&amp;#039;s music is evoked by Wagner&amp;#039;s distinctive songwriting - lyrically subtle and ambiguous, the vocals melodic but understated. Setting this apart from other minimalist songwriters is the large group of backing musicians, with the range of instruments and styles that it brings. Wagner&amp;#039;s songwriting bears similarities with soul musicians, and can be seen to embody Kris KristoffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dictum that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcountry music is the white manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e47764b60d8a162fefd3d3cc0fd74b589f8e50","amp;dn":"Lambchop+-+Oh+%28Ohio%29+%5Bmp3-vbr-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3e47764b60d8a162fefd3d3cc0fd74b589f8e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,228,119,100,182,13,138,22,47,239,211,211,204,15,215,75,88,159,142,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
