Recognizing this trend, this book provides a quick reference guide for small-animal trained veterinarians in the basics of surgery and treatment of farm animals. Popular animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, camelids and backyard poultry are covered, and basic techniques such as anaesthesia, clinical examination techniques, breeding, surgery and euthanasia are discussed. The book is an essential resource for practicing small animal veterinarians, veterinary and animal management students, for continuing professional development and as a refresher guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150d5a4db1f29592f15415e4e31e08889dce8da9","amp;dn":"Farm+Animal+Medicine+and+Surgery....%5BLeah1289%5D.....VRG......pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150d5a4db1f29592f15415e4e31e08889dce8da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,13,90,77,177,242,149,146,241,84,21,228,227,30,8,136,157,206,141,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
