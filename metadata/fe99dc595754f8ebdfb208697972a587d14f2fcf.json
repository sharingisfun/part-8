The art of the Migration period in Europe is linked to the animal-style art of the Eurasian Steppes. This region, stretching from Mongolia to Hungary, was host to tribes of warrior herdsmen who brandished lavishly ornamented swords, rode horses decked out with elaborate trappings, and wore splendid polychrome jewelry that incorporated animal and bird motifs. These tribes people followed their herds which provided daily food. When these people moved into Europe, their art was modified by Greco-Roman and Celtic traditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe99dc595754f8ebdfb208697972a587d14f2fcf","amp;dn":"Migration+Art+AD+300-800+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe99dc595754f8ebdfb208697972a587d14f2fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,153,220,89,87,84,248,235,223,178,8,105,121,114,165,135,209,79,47,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
