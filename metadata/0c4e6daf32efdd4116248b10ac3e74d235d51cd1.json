To most Americans, and even most Britons, the Tornados were one-hit wonders, responsible for &quot;Telstar&quot; and not much else, but as this set shows, they did come up with some cool sounds and tunes under the guidance of producer/manager Joe Meek. &quot;Robot&quot; is nearly as pretty a tune as &quot;Telstar&quot; (it also charted in England at No. 17), and it sounds fresh, as something not nearly as widely heard for 36 years; &quot;Life On Venus,&quot; the B-side, is a very close second, almost a &quot;son of Telstar.&quot; &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; was another British chart single, and offers the spectacle of Meek and the Tornados applying a Bo Diddley beat to their trademark sound. Other highlights include lots of television themes, both material for actual use on the air and the group's covers of such as material as &quot;Stringray&quot; and &quot;Aqua Marina&quot; from the sci-fi kids' show Stringray. The material extends right into 1964 and the band's attempts to compete in the area of vocal records, when it became clear that the public wasn't too interested in instrumental rock &amp; roll anymore. The annotation includes a beautifully detailed essay by Chris Welch, with extensive interview material on drummer Clem Cattini (the longest-tenured member of the Tornados) and Cattini's recollections on each of the tracks here. In the end, there's more to the Tornados' sound and history than most of us knew, all revealed here. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\nThe Tornados:\nThe first British group to top the American charts, the Tornados are best remembered for their ethereal organ-dominated instumental &quot;Telstar&quot;.\nThe band were London-based session musicians who were assembled by the legendary, maverick producer Joe Meek in 1961 as a deliberate challenge to The Shadows. They also worked as a backing-band for solo singers John Leyton, Don Charles and Michael Cox.\nIn 1962, while working as Billy Fury's backing group, they made their first recording &quot;Love And Fury&quot;. That failed but the Meek-penned follow-up &quot;Telstar&quot; - inspired by watching the first live television pictures transmitted via the Telstar satellite - was an international hit. The record was the first by a British group to top the American charts and went on to sell five million copies worldwide.\nHeinz Burt left for a solo career in 1963 but The Tornados carried on despite dwindling sales figures until '66, when the group disbanded and the members all returned to session work. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\nThe Tornados (in the U.S. they were credited as The Tornadoes) were an English instrumental group of the 1960s who acted as in-house backing group for many of record producer Joe Meek's productions.\n\nThe Tornados also enjoyed several chart hits in their own right, including the US Number One &quot;Telstar&quot; (named after the satellite and composed by Meek). It was the first US #1 by a British group. Since World War II only three British records had topped the US charts: &quot;Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart&quot; by Vera Lynn in 1952, &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; by Acker Bilk in May of 1962, and &quot;He's Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot; by Laurie London in 1958.\n\nFor a time the Tornados were considered serious rivals to The Shadows. Their single &quot;Globetrotter&quot; made it to number 5 in the UK Singles Chart but when bassist Heinz Burt left in 1963 for a solo career the group began to fall apart. By 1965 none of the original lineup remained. Later lineups were therefore credited as Tornados '65 and The New Tornados.\n\nA scopitone film (an early form of music video) was made for their chart hit &quot;Robot&quot; featuring members of the group walking around woodland dressed in appropriate headgear with their guitars, flirting with various young women and being finally arrested by policemen after lighting a campfire.\n\nAfter drummer and bandleader Clem Cattini left the Tornados in 1965 he became a successful session musician, playing on recording sessions for other artists, and was featured in Cliff Richard's backing bands. He holds the record for appearing the most times on UK #1 singles.\n\nRhythm guitarist George Bellamy is the father of Matthew Bellamy, frontman for British rock band Muse. The introduction in &quot;Knights Of Cydonia&quot; by Muse is very similar to that of &quot;Telstar&quot;. In 1975 four of the five original members tried an unsuccessful comeback as the Original Tornados. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tornados&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tornados&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLineup:\nAlan Caddy - lead guitar (born February 2nd 1940, London)\nGeorge Bellamy - rhythm guitar (born October 8th 1941, Sunderland)\nRoger Lavern - keyboards (born Roger Jackson, November 11th 1938, Kidderminster)\nHeinz Burt - bass guitar (born July 24th 1942, Hargin, Germany, died 7th April 2000)\nClem Cattini - drums (born August 28th 1939, London)\n\nRay Randall: (www.rayrandall.co.uk) Bass guitar took over from Heinz, 1963-1965.\nStuart Taylor: Lead guitar (born 23 October 1944, in London ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ died 18 April 2005).\nTab Martin: Bass - (born Alan Raymond Brearley, 24 December 1944, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumbria).\nBrian Gregg: Bass - (born 31 January 1939, London).\nDave Harvey: Bass\nJimmy O'Brien: keyboards\nBryan Irwin:\nNorman Hale: Keyboards on &quot;Love and Fury&quot; (first line-up)\n\nTornados 65 (on &quot;Early Bird&quot; and &quot;Stingray&quot; singles)\nRoger Warwick: Tenor saxophone\n\nThe New Tornados (1966 singles, The Saxons renamed plus David Watts (key))\nJohn Davies, Robb Huxley, Pete Holder, David Watts, Roger Holder.\n\n\nTracklist:\nCD 1\n01.
