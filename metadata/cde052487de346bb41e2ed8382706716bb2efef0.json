It was released on 13 November 2006 via Sony BMG. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and number twenty-three on the Billboard 200, and it reached the top twenty on most other album charts.  The album contains songs chiefly from George Michael's solo career, but also from his earlier days with Wham!. The album comes in two formats: a 2-CD set and a limited edition 3-CD set. The 2-CD set contains 26 tracks, including four recorded with Wham! and three new songs: &quot;An Easier Affair&quot;, &quot;This Is Not Real Love&quot; (a duet with British singer Mutya Buena) and a new version of &quot;Heal the Pain&quot;, recorded with Paul McCartney. The limited edition 3-CD version contains an additional 14 lesser known tracks, including one with Wham! and another new song called &quot;Understand&quot;.  The 2-CD version was released in the United States on 1 April 2008, with two changes from the international version: &quot;Feeling Good&quot; replaced the Wham! track &quot;Freedom&quot;, and &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; (from Songs from the Last Century) replaced &quot;Round Here&quot;, a track from Patience that was not released as a single in the US  A 3-CD limited deluxe version was released in the United States exclusively by Best Buy. The track listing for the third CD is the same as the international version, but unlike the 2-CD US version, the deluxe version includes &quot;Freedom&quot; instead of &quot;Feeling Good&quot;. The 3-CD version is packaged in a digipak. It includes a 36-page color booklet with lyrics for every track, along with screen shots from the videos for most of the tracks on the first two CDs..\n\n \n\nCD01 - Twenty Five CD01 For Living - Track Listings\n\n[01] Everything She Wants - - - Wham\n[02] Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go - - - Wham\n[03] Freedom - - - Wham\n[04] Faith\n[05] Too Funky\n[06] Fastlove\n[07] Freedom 90\n[08] Spinning The Wheel\n[09] Outside\n[10] As - - - George Michael &amp; Mary J.
