Ã¢â‚¬ËœSame Trailer Different ParkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is well-written, edgy (yet familiar) and coated in Ã¢â‚¬Å“cool.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Musgraves is an original who at age 24 is surprisingly wise and adept at using her voice to share her experiences. \n\nThe Texas singer co-wrote all 12 tracks on Ã¢â‚¬ËœSame Trailer Different Park,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ including her current Top 20 single, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMerry Go Ã¢â‚¬ËœRound.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ The strength of the lyrics on this album is difficult to overstate. Musgraves has a soft-spoken, introverted style that often falls back on familiar phrases or ideas and turns them into something new and brilliant. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sticks and stones may build a throne / But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be up there all alone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings on Ã¢â‚¬ËœStep Off,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a punchy little folk song about telling an ex to get lost.\n\nThe first five tracks are the heart of the album. Ã¢â‚¬ËœSilver LiningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounds like a canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t-miss single. Musgraves will be painted as some sort of bad girl because she sings about drugs and girls kissing girls (depending on interpretation) later on the album, but this opening track is absolutely uplifting. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ever gonna find a silver lining / ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotta be a cloudy day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she reminds us before similar country inspirations.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœDandelionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just like him / You always leave me crying dandelionÃ¢â‚¬Å“) is another poetic story wrapped in acoustic guitar and heartbreaking metaphor. Next is Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlowinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Smoke,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ her second single. Fans of Pistol Annies will embrace this story of wobbly dreams. Musgraves plays with the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“blowing smokeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to offer several meanings throughout the shuffling, blues-tinged track.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœMy HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœStupidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are the only real crank-it-up moments on Ã¢â‚¬ËœSame Trailer Different Park,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ an album that relies on more somber chord structures and melodies for effect. One wild moment might not have been a bad idea, perhaps in place of the sleepy Ã¢â‚¬ËœBack on the Map.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ However, an argument could be made that a splash of cherry red might have disrupted the pallet of grays, organic greens and yellows Musgraves has used to paint with such efficiency and passion.\n\nThe next to last track is Ã¢â‚¬ËœFollow Your Arrow,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a song that is guaranteed to be the biggest controversy on country radio this year. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Make lots of noise / Kiss lots of boys / Kiss lots of girls if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re into / When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight roll up a joint / Or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t / Just follow your arrow wherever it points,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to find a funny song with emotional depth, but this track hits on multiple levels. The singer has said in interviews that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pushing for it as a single, and if one is simply choosing the best songs to offer radio, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a no-brainer. One year from now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all know if a new female artist can get away with some of the things Musgraves says early in this song. Our fingers are crossed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7b1820b4e4228afee30564a833c94d2a81ab5e","amp;dn":"Kacey+Musgraves+-+Same+Trailer+Different+Park+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7b1820b4e4228afee30564a833c94d2a81ab5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,123,24,32,180,228,34,138,254,227,5,100,168,51,201,77,42,129,171,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
