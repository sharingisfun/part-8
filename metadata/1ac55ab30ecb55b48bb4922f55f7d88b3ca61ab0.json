Some of Howardâ€™s best-known charactersâ€“Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, and sailor Steve Costigan among themâ€“roam the forbidding locales of the authorâ€™s fevered imagination, from the swamps and bayous of the Deep South to the fiend-haunted woods outside Paris to remote jungles in Africa.\r\n\r\nThe collection includes Howardâ€™s masterpiece â€œPigeons from Hell,â€ which Stephen King calls â€œone of the finest horror stories of [the twentieth] century,â€ a tale of two travelers who stumble upon the ruins of a Southern plantationâ€“and into the maw of its fatal secret.
