I work at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Thank you for reading my story. However, let me warn you.\r\nYou may not like me too much. One, I make a lot of money. Two, I have an opinion on everything. Three, I have had a boyfriend before. OK, maybe two.\r\nNow if all this was the case with a guy, one might be cool with it. But since I am a girl these three things I mentioned donâ€™t really make me too likeable, do they?\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4faba470ed5a6fcb37ed6a7bb896db1b0adc8c6","amp;dn":"One+Indian+Girl+-+Chetan+Bhagat+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4faba470ed5a6fcb37ed6a7bb896db1b0adc8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,250,186,71,14,213,166,252,179,126,214,167,187,137,109,177,176,173,200,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
