A library that keeps things simple and straightforward. All sections and the most common articulations are provided in this collection. Recorded with a highly professional and renowned orchestra that is also credited for their work in our libraries â€œTuttiâ€ and â€œVivaceâ€. Making this multi sampled orchestral sample collection the pivotal accomplishment to complete the Sonokinetic cinematic orchestral tools.\r\n\r\nIt has been a dream to create a library like this. Sonokinetic has put in their utmost best to produce this unique instrument. After a long production period we proudly present to you â€˜Da Capoâ€™.\r\n\r\nMultisampling orchestral instruments is the most coveted and demanded area in the sampling industry and we are very much aware of that. So we set out to build an instrument that matches up to the high quality standards composers and producers expect whilst trying not to overcomplicate the instrument. There are so many possible options and details with multisampling that the usability, accessibly and playability can easily become lost in a load of technical options. Therefore we decided to keep things as straightforward from a user perspective as possible.\r\n\r\nDa Capo enables legato playing in the most common areas of the orchestral setup. This legato offers you a unique chance to play Polyphonic section legato within the same instrument patch. Intelligent Polyphonic section legato provides realism without adding to the instrumentâ€™s complexity from a playerâ€™s view.\r\n\r\nDue to the â€˜all in oneâ€™ approach which Sonokinetic believes in, there is another option available that makes Da Capo score high on the efficiency scale. This instrument can easily stack sections and articulations including the intelligent Polyphonic section legato within your Da Capo. All without loading multiple instances of the instrument in your DAW template.\r\n\r\nOur â€˜Old Paths New Discoveriesâ€™ philosophy covers this, by providing a large collection of newly recorded orchestral section samples. They have a proven sound quality within a scoring tool environment that focuses on quick access to articulations and sounds. Whatâ€™s more, they will blend easily with your sampled or live recorded production.\r\n\r\nIt has been an honor working with a gifted team and we present to youâ€¦\r\nâ€œDa Capo â€“ Multi Sampled Symphonic Orchestraâ€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b6b00d927b2147c79ed15d49384beec810a66a","amp;dn":"Sonokinetic.Da.Capo.24BiT.KONTAKT-SYNTHiC4TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b6b00d927b2147c79ed15d49384beec810a66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,182,176,13,146,123,33,71,199,158,209,93,73,56,75,238,200,16,166,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
