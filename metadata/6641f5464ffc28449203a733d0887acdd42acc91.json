It has been a valued and sought after text ever since. It was put out of print in the 1970s, but since that time interest in the martial arts have continued to skyrocket. Pa-Kua gives an introduction to the little known mystical martial art from China, Pa Kua Chang (also known as Ba Gua Zhang), translated as &quot;Eight Trigram Boxing&quot;. Smith describes its history, profiles its great practitioners and gives a series of unique exercises, illustrating the solo practice and their fighting applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6641f5464ffc28449203a733d0887acdd42acc91","amp;dn":"Pa-Kua+-+Chinese+Boxing+for+Fitness+an+Self-Defense+%282003%29Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6641f5464ffc28449203a733d0887acdd42acc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,65,245,70,79,252,40,68,146,3,167,51,208,136,122,205,212,42,204,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
