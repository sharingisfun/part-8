Today, The Rolling Stones are still the most popular band in the world, and are acknowledged as one of the greatest cultural icons in modern history.\n\nBy 1964 the United States had been &quot;invaded&quot; by a number of British bands, led by the Beatles. The Rolling Stones were seen as more rebellious and rowdy than The BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they were the &quot;bad boys&quot; as opposed to the &quot;good boys&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and this reputation only served to enhance their popularity with their teenage fans.
