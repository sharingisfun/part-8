The course teaches Unix from the\n\n    ground up, starting with the basics of the command line and\n\n    graduating to powerful, advanced tools like grep, sed, and\n\n    xargs. The course shows how to enter commands in Terminal to\n\n    create, move, copy, and delete files and folders; change file\n\n    ownership and permissions; view and stop command and application\n\n    processes; find and edit data within files; and use command-line\n\n    shortcuts to speed up workflow. Exercise files accompany the\n\n    course.\n\n\n\n    Topics include:\n\n\n\n    * Moving around the file system\n\n    * Creating and reading files\n\n    * Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories\n\n    * Creating hard links and symbolic links\n\n    * Understanding user identity, file ownership, and sudo\n\n    * Setting file permissions with alpha and octal notation\n\n    * Changing the PATH variable\n\n    * Using the command history\n\n    * Directing input and output\n\n    * Configuring the Unix working environment\n\n    * Searching and replacing using grep and regular expressions\n\n    * Manipulating text with tr, sed, and cut\n\n    * Integrating with the Finder, Spotlight, and AppleScript\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpack, burn or mount and enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGREETINGS\n\n\n\n\n\nWe salute our friends, our loyal members and our fair competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n                      THE ALMIGHTY QUASAR   2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7e398d3673af7f162d354414232ab05c93d7bb","amp;dn":"Lynda.com.Unix.for.Mac.OS.X.Users-QUASAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7e398d3673af7f162d354414232ab05c93d7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,126,57,141,54,115,175,127,22,45,53,68,20,35,42,176,92,147,215,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
