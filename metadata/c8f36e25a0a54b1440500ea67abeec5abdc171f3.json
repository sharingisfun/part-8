Exploring the various facets of relationships from infatuation on &quot;A Case of You&quot; to insecurity on &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot;, the songs feature simple accompaniments on piano, guitar, and Appalachian dulcimer. Blue was a critical and commercial success, reaching #15 on the Billboard 200 and #3 in the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;Carey&quot; reached #93 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In January 2000, the New York Times chose Blue as one of the 25 albums that represented &quot;turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music&quot;\n\n\n Review:\nDespite the success of her first three albums and songs like &quot;Woodstock&quot;, the 1970s saw Mitchell make a decision to break from performing. After a tough breakup with her longtime boyfriend Graham Nash she set off on a vacation around Europe, during which she wrote many of the songs that appear on Blue.\nThe album was almost released in a somewhat different form. In March 1971, completed masters for the album were ready for production.\nThere has been persistent speculation that the album, and particularly the title track, were named after fellow songwriter David Blue,[9] who was a friend and possible love interest of Mitchell's when the album was released. She has denied the connection.\nIn 1979 Mitchell reflected, &quot;The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.&quot;\nThe album was influenced by jazz, particularly the music of Miles Davis, whose original Kind of Blue album cover this one resembles. This combined with the similar titles, suggests an homage. Mitchell used alternative tunings on her guitar to allow easier access to augmented chords and notes in unexpected combinations. Due to the stark and bare revelations in the album, when it was first played for Nashville tunesmith Kris Kristofferson, he is reported to have commented either Ã¢â‚¬ËœJoni, ugh. Keep some of that to yourself!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlease! Leave something of yourself.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\n\n\nTracklist:\nSide one\n&quot;All I Want&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:32\n&quot;My Old Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:33\n&quot;Little Green&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:25\n&quot;Carey&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n&quot;Blue&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\nSide two\n&quot;California&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:48\n&quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n&quot;River&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n&quot;A Case of You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n&quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:13\n\n\n\n\nGeneral:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: folk rock, folk\nSource:CD \nFormat : FLAC+.cue\n\nAudio\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration : 36mn 13s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 738 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 191 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f36e25a0a54b1440500ea67abeec5abdc171f3","amp;dn":"%281971+%29+Joni+Mitchel+-+Blue+%5BFLAC%2B.cue%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f36e25a0a54b1440500ea67abeec5abdc171f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,243,110,37,160,165,75,20,64,80,14,166,122,190,236,90,189,193,113,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
