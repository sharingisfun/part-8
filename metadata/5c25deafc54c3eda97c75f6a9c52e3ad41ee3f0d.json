He makes friends with Grimsdyke, who is reluctant to qualify since he has been left a thousand a year for the duration of his training, Benskin, who is principally interested in girls, and Evans, who is only interested in football. Together, these four go through their medical education - the post-rugger match rag, examinations, encounters with nurses, irate sisters, patients.\n\n\n\n\nCast:\nRichard Briers (Simon Sparrow)\nGeoffrey Sumner (Sir Lancelot Sprat)\nJoan Sanderson (Sister Virtue)\nIrene Handl (Mrs. Clarke)\nJohn LeMesurier (The Dean)\n\n\n\nWriter: Ray Cooney (from original novel by Richard Gordon)\n\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E01 - St Swithin's\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E02 - Digs\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E03 - Anatomy\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E04 - In The Wards\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E05 - Our First Operation\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E06 - Sex And St Swithins\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E07 - Our First Baby\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E08 - Happy Christmas\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E09 - Out-Patients\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E10 - Money Troubles\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E11 - Women And Wine\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E12 - Marriage-It-Is\nDoctor In The House - S01 - E13 - To Pass Or Not To Pass\n\n\n====================================================================\n\n\n\nDoctor At Large - Series 01 - Audio Comedy - BBC7 via DVB-T \n13 x 30 minute episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo\n\n\nFollowing on from Doctor In The House, newly qualified Simon Sparrow travels to gain valuable experience before becoming a surgeon.\n\n\nCast:\nRichard Briers\nGeoffrey Sumner \nPeter Jones.\n\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E01 - The Deep End\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E02 - The SS Lotus\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E03 - Women On Board\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E04 - The Doctor's Dilemma\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E05 - Farewell Las Palmas\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E06 - The Captain's Problem\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E07 - Mozambique\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E08 - In General Practice\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E09 - To Bed Or Not To Bed\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E10 - Dr Sparrow Of Harley Street\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E11 - Disengagement\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E12 - Fellowship\nDoctor At Large - S01 - E13 - Marriage And Surgery\n\n.\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c25deafc54c3eda97c75f6a9c52e3ad41ee3f0d","amp;dn":"Doctor+In+The+House+And+At+Large+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c25deafc54c3eda97c75f6a9c52e3ad41ee3f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,37,222,175,197,76,62,218,151,199,95,106,156,82,227,173,65,238,63,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
