Their style has been described as &quot;art-punk&quot;, and they have been compared to bands like The Clash, Fugazi, Bruce Springsteen, The Replacements, and Nick Cave.\n\nThe name of the band is taken from an episode of Coast to Coast with Art Bell, in which Bell was playing recordings of ghost voices in static, and one of the ghostsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ names was Constantine.[1]\n\nFrom their hometown of Guelph the band relocated to London, Ontario and then to Toronto, where in 2001 they released their self-titled first album. Constantines enjoyed widespread play on campus radio and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Alternative Album. The first track, &quot;Arizona&quot;, is based on the suicide of Danny Rapp, the lead singer of Danny and the Juniors of &quot;At the Hop&quot; fame. The song begins with the lyric &quot;This is a song about the death of Danny Rapp. And that great gospel jest called rock 'n' roll.&quot;\n\nIn 2002 they added keyboard player Evan Gordon to the lineup and released the EP The Modern Sinner Nervous Man. Gordon left the band soon after to pursue his own song writing. He was replaced by Will Kidman, and the band released Shine a Light in 2003. This album was the band's first to be released outside of Canada on the Sub Pop record label.\n\nIn 2005, they embarked on a cross-Canada tour with The Weakerthans called The Rolling Tundra Revue. Later in the year their album Tournament of Hearts was released September 27 by Toronto record label Three Gut Records in Canada, and on October 11 by Sub Pop in the United States.\n\nThe members of the Constantines have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze, covering Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young covers for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.\n\nIn 2007, following the demise of their former Canadian record label Three Gut Records, the Constantines signed with Arts &amp; Crafts. On January 15, 2008 they released a limited edition 7&quot; on white vinyl, entitled Hard Feelings. Their fourth full-length album, Kensington Heights, was released on April 15 in Canada and April 29 in the US.\n\nGuitarist Steve Lambke has released three albums and a split 12&quot; under the name Baby Eagle, and keyboard player Will Kidman has recorded under the name Woolly Leaves.\n\nIn December 2009, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a tour of southwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, keyboardist Will Kidman left the band. This, coupled with Webb's migration from his home in MontrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©al back to Guelph, fueled rumours of the band's demise.[2] In an August 2010 radio interview, however, Webb said, &quot;I think we're just slowing down. We'll just say, 'see you around.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstantines 2001\n\n\n\nConstantines is the eponymous debut album by the Constantines. It was released June 5, 2001 on the Canadian record label Three Gut Records.
