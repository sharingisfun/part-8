It causes your system to slow down and not run as stable as you would want it to a month or two down the road.\n\nAnother thing is tweaks. All these ISO&amp;#039;s out there with XP SP3 and these tweaks are not only making your system &quot;faster&quot;, but when you install your drivers, all that speed goes right down the drain, and your computer begins to break down.\n\n-----------------------------\nExplanation of this Release:\n-----------------------------\n\nThis is a standard, Windows XP SP1 disc. I have put a volume key inside it, so that way when it decides to validate you, it&amp;#039;s already validated. However, if the setup tells you that the KEY is incorrect during installation, use this key:  PXQKT-6Y2TF-HHYGX-RFB48-YKVRQ , then continue your install. When you get done and it asks to validate, use the key on the CD in the text file provided (VOLUME KEY.txt).\n\n-----------------------------\nProcess of a stable PC:\n-----------------------------\n1. Once you are on your desktop for the first time, install your chipset drivers. Restart your computer after that.\n2. Continue to install your other drivers, and if you feel you must, restart after each seperate driver to help with stability.\n3. After all drivers are complete and you have restarted your computer as necessary, install your service packs. Now, this is when some people get confused, but let me explain:\n\n-You can install service pack 2 first, then install service pack 3. Though this is not necessary, it&amp;#039;s probably the best fail-safe solution of upgrading your installation. \n-You can just download service pack 3 (the 300mb~ executable) and install it as needed.\n\n4. When SP3 is done and you&amp;#039;ve restarted your computer and it&amp;#039;s ready to go, and you are connected to the internet, let your system do automatic updates. If it doesn&amp;#039;t appear, go to internet explorer and go to windows update manually. You&amp;#039;ll need to install all the updates that it gives you. DO NOT CANCEL THE INTERNET EXPLORER 7 INSTALL! Even though you might not use it (I hate firefox btw, get Opera), you oughta get it to update your COM+ and Active X on your system. And yes, active X is used OUTSIDE of the internet browser. This is why windows is very broken when people nlite internet explorer out of the system.\n\n5. Now, since you have all that jargon done, you can start your tweaking and necessary things that you feel you need to do. If you want a tweak file that disables services and turns off performance counters to speed up your system, send an email: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aec2cfcccbc2979feecdc1d680c0cbda&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nOh yeah, there&amp;#039;s a few extras on this ISO too. *hint hint*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77d7255e55153c44910244f3eeb69e0bdb15ba5a","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+SP1+%28with+key+and+stability+notes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77d7255e55153c44910244f3eeb69e0bdb15ba5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,215,37,94,85,21,60,68,145,2,68,243,238,182,158,11,219,21,186,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
