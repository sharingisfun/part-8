He proposes that in order to write reliable opinions, these men and women must have a deeper understanding of the enduring principles upon which the law naturally tends to draw. In the study of constitutional law, Anastaplo argues that it is more important to weigh what the Supreme Court has said and how that is said -- what considerations it weighed and how -- than it is to know what it is recorded that the Court &quot;decided.&quot; In Reflections on Constitutional Law, Anastaplo makes the case for a renewed focus on a now often-overlooked aspect of the study of law. He emphasizes the continuing significance and importance of the Constitution by thoroughly examining the most important influences on the American constitutional system, including the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9afac62b81fefa4f24542a7ad9b5642e6f8f5d36","amp;dn":"Reflections+on+Constitutional+Law","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9afac62b81fefa4f24542a7ad9b5642e6f8f5d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,250,198,43,129,254,250,79,36,84,42,122,217,181,100,46,111,143,93,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
