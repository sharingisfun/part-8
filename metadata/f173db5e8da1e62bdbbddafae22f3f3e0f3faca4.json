Beneath the town of Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen dungeon levels to ultimately come face to face with Diablo and his demon minions.\n\nDiablo was a best-seller and following the first game's popularity an expansion pack, entitled Diablo: Hellfire, was released in 1997, although it was not created by Blizzard Entertainment (Sierra).\n\nThis release is a pre-cracked portable copy of Diablo I and its expansion, HellFire. HellFire has been cracked to include a multiplayer client and additional characters (Monk, Barbarian, and Bard). This release contains all the audio and video files from the old releases (thereby explaining the size) and only files which contributed nothing to gameplay have been removed. This game is not multi-language and is only available in English.\n\nThis release will allow up to eighteen users to play cooperativly through the Diablo campaign using the Internet, a LAN, or a direct connection.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nI take no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer\nthrough the trial of this Crack-Mod. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this mod-crack took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nI am ZKZ. \nI am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. \nProps to the scene.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Diablo - Ultimate.rar&quot; file to a directory of your choice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default &quot;Diablo&quot; directory. Double-click on the &quot;Diablo_Mod-Crack_ZKZ.exe&quot; program. This program is not necessary as it only installs shortcuts (makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe Mod-Crack to the &quot;Diablo&quot; directory.\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game. Create a server on the desired campaign map or alternatively  \njoin a game already in progress.\n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;Diable&quot;                          - Multiplayer/Single player Diablo\n&quot;HellFire&quot;                  \t  - Multiplayer/Single player HellFire\n\nNote: The official manual is included in the &quot;X:DiabloManual&quot; directory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released A.S.A.P.\n\nHalf Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPDATE*\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nThis release is imminent. It will possess an independent emulator rather than PAC-STEAM and as such will not need frequent updates. It will also be cleaner with a faster frame rate and most importantly a complete Half-Life 2 campaign and a (partially complete) Half-Life 2 Episode One campaign. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient. \n\nFarCry Co-op - BHD UPDATE*\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete - Loads of Fun\n\nThis update will include the Black Hawk Down Assault Co-op mini mod made for FarCry. It will be released when time can be found for basic testing and the writing of a noob-friendly NFO.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project Quake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHalf Life 2 Co-op - Synergy (No UPD*)\t|Doom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete - Loads of Fun\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3786631\t\t\t\t\t|3748246/Doom_3_Ultimate_Coop\n\nFarCry Co-op - Assault/Campaign Co-op   |Quake II Ultimate Co-op - COOP or DIE\t\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete \nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete \nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete \nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete \nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3791203\t \t\t\t\t|3792230/Quake_II_Ultimate_COOP_or_DIE_\n\nHalf Life Opposing Force - Hlcoop Clan \t|Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|\n3795267/Half-Life_Opposing_Force_\t|\nUltimate_Co-op  \t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\n                                        |\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/42\n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)\t|36344/Half-Life_Ultimate__Co-op_%5BInc\n\t\t\t\t        |ludes_Blue_Shift__amp__Opposing_Force%\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t    Scene Requests/Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNeed - To the many individuals who already have questioned the need for a new Diablo release, the Federation offers this rebuttal. This project began when one of our members was unable to locate a Portable copy of Diablo or Hellfire (in Wnglish with the HellFire multiplayer crack). This was shocking as the Federation concentrates primarily on Co-op games and Diablo was a founding title that all our members played at one point or another. Therefore we undertook the task of creating this release. It is retro, but it is also shockingly streamlined and well developed. In short this release fulfills our requirements as it creates accessibility. If you think it still serves no purpose don't download it.\n\nIf you are a talented Ascii artist or wish to make a request contact: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f796828398c3c7cec2c5c1b79f82849f9a969e9bd994989a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\t\t\t\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;86ababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;--------------\n                                  Known Problems\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.)
