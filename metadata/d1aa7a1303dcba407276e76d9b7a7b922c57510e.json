The mind in question belongs to Zeno Cosini, a neurotic Italian businessman who is writing his confessions at the behest of his psychiatrist. Here are ZenoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interminable attempts to quit smoking, his courtship of the beautiful yet unresponsive Ada, his unexpectedÃ¢â‚¬â€œand unexpectedly happyÃ¢â‚¬â€œmarriage to AdaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homely sister Augusta, and his affair with a shrill-voiced aspiring singer. Relating these misadventures with wry wit and a perspicacity at once unblinking and compassionate, ZenoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Conscience is a miracle of psychological realism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1aa7a1303dcba407276e76d9b7a7b922c57510e","amp;dn":"Zeno%27s+Conscience+-+Italo+Svevo+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1aa7a1303dcba407276e76d9b7a7b922c57510e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,170,122,19,3,220,186,64,114,118,231,109,155,122,123,146,44,87,81,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
