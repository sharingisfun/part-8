Time to Spend\n\nSomewhere between Johnny Cash and Lightnin' Hopkins, you'll find Chris Smither, whose first studio recording in 15 years, originally released in 1993, was re- issued by Tone Cool Records. A fixture on the '60s folk scene, Smither also has several ties to the blues; he's been covered by Bonnie Raitt and John Mayall and is a devotee of Mississippi John Hurt. That's reflected on several tracks on this album, notably the fun, up-tempo &quot;Already Gone&quot; and the spooky, tension-laden &quot;The Devil's Real.&quot; Smither's folkier selections are more of an acquired taste, especially for blues devotees, but in a way the Johnny-Cash-like rendition of &quot;Killin' the Blues&quot; is its own reward--and for the purist, it's followed up by the excellent &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Doctor.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/18/chris-smither/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:698d3febf6f099fe0a92c40d8ecb00cdcfde19cc","amp;dn":"Chris+Smither...Happier+Blue%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"698d3febf6f099fe0a92c40d8ecb00cdcfde19cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,141,63,235,246,240,153,254,10,146,196,13,142,203,0,205,207,222,25,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
