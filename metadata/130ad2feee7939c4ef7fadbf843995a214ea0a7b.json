Offerings like Margaret AtwoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Homelanding, a vignette about alien life, and Steven MillhauserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Wizard of West Orange, which conclusively demonstrates that any story centering around a new science is science fiction, make it clear that nongenre authors have been writing stories that appropriate many genre tropes. But while the title will attract genre fans, li-fi readers who might otherwise be drawn in by T.C. Boyle and Don DeLillo may well be put off by the Tachyon imprint and the words science fiction, undermining the editorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ assertion that the walls that separate the mainstream from science fiction are, in fact, crumbling.
