As captivating in audio as in print, the book features Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom and provides a glimpse into American life in the early 1980sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including lines at gas stations and hostages in Iran. Narrator Arthur Morey's performance is an ideal complement to Updike's brilliantly drawn characters and rich prose. Not so much a story as a snapshot of American life, with some tawdry sex to spice things up, RABBIT IS RICH benefits from Morey's ability to define characters with inflections and nuanced tones that accentuate every word. As a result of Morey's understated style, listeners can truly appreciate the power of this classic. D.J.S. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award.\n - - - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nUpdike's most famous work is his Rabbit series. Both Rabbit Is Rich and Rabbit At Rest received the Pulitzer Prize.
