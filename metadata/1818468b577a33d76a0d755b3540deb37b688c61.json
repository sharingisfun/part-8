He's intolerant, rude and paranoid. All hell frequently breaks loose as Basil tries to run the hotel, constantly under verbal (and sometime physical) attack from his unhelpful wife Sybil, and hindered by the incompetent, but easy target, Manuel; their Spanish waiter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1818468b577a33d76a0d755b3540deb37b688c61","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers+%281975%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1818468b577a33d76a0d755b3540deb37b688c61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,24,70,139,87,122,51,215,106,13,117,91,53,64,222,179,123,104,140,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
