Classified documents and interviews point to covert Western, rather than Soviet activity. This is backed up by former US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who stated that Western &quot;testing&quot; operations were carried out regularly in Swedish waters. Royal Navy submarine captains have also admitted to top-secret operations.\n\nOla Tunander's revelations make it clear that the United States and Britain ran a &quot;secret war&quot; in Swedish waters. The number of Swedes perceiving the Soviet Union as a direct threat increased from 5-10 per cent in 1980 to 45 per cent in 1983. This Anglo-American &quot;secret war&quot; was aimed at exerting political influence over Sweden. It was a risky enterprise, but perhaps the most successful covert operation of the entire Cold War. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Secret-War-Against-Sweden-Submarine/dp/0714682756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302804630&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Secret-War-Against-Sweden-Submarine/dp/0714682756/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302804630&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ac5eeaf4e5442c3057452222abf143c674e4469","amp;dn":"The+Secret+War+Against+Sweden%3A+US+and+British+Submarine+Deceptio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ac5eeaf4e5442c3057452222abf143c674e4469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,197,238,175,78,84,66,195,5,116,82,34,42,191,20,60,103,78,68,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
