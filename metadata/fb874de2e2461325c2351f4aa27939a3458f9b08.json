It was also a weapon.\n\nSimplicity isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a design principle at AppleÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a value that permeates every level of the organization. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011.\n\nThanks to Steve JobsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncompromising ways, you can see Simplicity in everything Apple does: the way itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s structured, the way it innovates, and the way it speaks to its customers.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb874de2e2461325c2351f4aa27939a3458f9b08","amp;dn":"Insanely+Simple%3A+The+Obsession+That+Drives+Apple%27s+Success","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb874de2e2461325c2351f4aa27939a3458f9b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,135,77,226,226,70,19,37,194,53,31,74,162,121,57,163,69,143,155,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
