In that time, frontman Eric Oblander toured the world with Clutch during what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to think of as their Ã¢â‚¬Å“family bandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ period that also included an organ and was brought in to sing for Sorcen, a partial Necros reunion. Guitarist Phil DÃƒÂ¼rr (also of Big Chief) joined forces with Luder, Five Horse JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Small Stone compatriot act which also features label head Scott Hamilton on guitar. And Jean-Paul Gaster, who played drums on The Mystery Spot, also happens to play in Clutch. The ties especially between Five Horse Johnson and Clutch prove pervasive throughout the formerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming seventh album, The Taking of Black Heart. Gaster makes a return appearance on drums for the 11-track outing, and the record was produced in everything but OblanderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals by longtime Clutch engineer J. Robbins at The Magpie Cage in Baltimore. Robbins, also of Jawbox, also contributes organ and percussion throughout The Taking of Black Heart, and Cheap Trick vocalist Robin Zander steps up for a take on Rod StewartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re My Girl (I DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want to Discuss It)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that trades off the parenthetical Ã¢â‚¬Å“DiscussÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the more genial Ã¢â‚¬Å“Talk About.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Through several of its tracks, The Taking of Black Heart seems to rely on some consistent lyrical thematic, though if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a narrative arc to the tracks, I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what it is. Nonetheless, on opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Job,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Oblander mentions his horse, named Mexico, which appears a short time later on the track Ã¢â‚¬Å“MexicoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Heart Baby,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Smash and GrabÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the closing pair of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shoot My Way OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Die in the RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seem to work in a successive progression toward the unhappy ending of the last cut, and the atmosphere remains relatively close to the Western-style vibing evident on the cover art. So if nothing else, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lot of context behind Five Horse JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seventh, though the songs themselves arrive with as little pretense as possible, coated in blues influence and driving heavy rock that, unsurprisingly, finds a lot of common ground with latter-day Clutch.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c663fba82b79b2f08394eb2895545ebdd008fd36","amp;dn":"Five+Horse+Johnson+-+The+Taking+Of+Black+Heart+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c663fba82b79b2f08394eb2895545ebdd008fd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,99,251,168,43,121,178,240,131,148,235,40,149,84,94,189,208,8,253,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
