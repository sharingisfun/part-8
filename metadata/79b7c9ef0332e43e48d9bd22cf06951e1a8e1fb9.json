At the age of 71, Glass found a new love, a new muse, and a new collaboratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the acclaimed cellist Wendy Sutter, who is perhaps best known for her work as part of the Bang On A Can ensemble. Critics hail the work as powerful and exalted: he enlightens, she inspires (so we're made to believe). But who would have thought Glass could be so sentimental. Listen for yourself. You might become a little inspired, if not more enlightened, yourself.\nunknown\n-------- Tracks ------------- \n1. Song I\n2. Song II\n3. Song III\n4. Song IV\n5. Song V\n6. Song VI\n7.
