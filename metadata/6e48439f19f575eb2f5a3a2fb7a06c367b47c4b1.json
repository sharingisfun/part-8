In one dramatic episode he finds himself driven out of Berlin in a black Mercedes by a secret organization that was believed to have disappeared after the second World War and eventually arrives in a modern Nazi watering hole. Gardiner, however, survives this incredible journey and brings us the secrets of the Order held sacred for so long.\n\nGardiner delves into a world that is often hidden from our eyes and finds himself in situations that seem to mirror the fictional world of the Da Vinci Code.\n\nIn Secret Societies, Gardiner:\n-Gets to the core of the secret societies' belief systems.\n-Explores the secret origins of Freemasonry and the links to secret Serpent Cults.\n-Investigates the secret hidden meaning of King Arthur and Robin Hood. -Examines the claimants to the name of Illuminati, and analyzes the history of the group in Europe and America.\n-Reveals the secret links within the Vatican and the Nazi Party.\n-Looks in-depth at the white-powdered gold theory supposedly kept secret by orders throughout time and radically re-appraises it.\n-Shows the link between the so-called enlightenment experience and the control of our minds.\n\nNobody in the genre involves themselves in the tale in the same way that Gardiner does, and here he shows that the search for ultimate truth can often be a terrifying one.
