Just say no. Its going to ask you to update everytime you launch game, never click yes. If you click yes you will not be able to play unless you find a register key, which i cant find any out there, ive looked everywhere. Youd have to delete the game and reinstall it if you clicked yes and dont have a serial. But its doesnt really matter, not updating still lets you play the whole game and everything except the online play of course. Which youd need a serial for the game to play online. If any of you happen to find a couple serials, be a pal and share :)**\n\n\n\nIf you do update game you will need a serial, i dont know where any true ones are and I havent tried these but if youd like to see if theyd work go ahead. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4476498/Red_Alert_3_Serials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4476498/Red_Alert_3_Serials&lt;/a&gt;\n\n^You dont need serial as long as you dont update game when it asks you^\n\n\n\nI havent played through the whole game so let me know what you find. But i have already encountered some graphics issues, but lowering the resolution and lowering some details make it better.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c191b514f11d98228525a13ebf48b3b989a8d8eb","amp;dn":"Command+And+Conquer+Red+Alert+3+%28MAC%29-INTEL-Hottwings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c191b514f11d98228525a13ebf48b3b989a8d8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,145,181,20,241,29,152,34,133,37,161,62,191,72,179,185,137,168,216,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
