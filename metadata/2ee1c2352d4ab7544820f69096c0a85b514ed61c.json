Rudi Protrudi growls through some of the most furious Fuzztones songs ever recorded, as Deb O&amp;#039;Nair pounds her Vox organ.(AMG)\n\n\nThis is the classic Fuzztones album from the early incarnation of the band. Featuring unbeatable original songs and covers that are better than the original recordings. The energy and production are so strong - I daresay, relentless - this album will knock your socks (and maybe a few other things) right off!
