The modern story, as well as large parts of the personal stories, have been cut to provide a more focused and relevant end product. The aim, to reach a broader audience and to show appreciation for the great number of excellent scenes that have made this fan edit possible. It is with delight that I can deliver the fan edit with English subtitles so that this boiled down version of the eight episodes long series, that the tax money of all Danes has paid for, can be enjoyed by people outside of our little country","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0526267bb4128c24695a37216613130db61d83c","amp;dn":"1864+Fan+Edit+%282014%29+-+720p+Danish+%5BEnglish+Subtitles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0526267bb4128c24695a37216613130db61d83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,82,98,103,187,65,40,194,70,149,163,114,22,97,49,48,219,97,216,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
