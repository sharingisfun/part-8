The album is the result of the collaboration between Omar Sosa and renowned Brazilian cellist, composer and arranger Jacques Morelenbaum. \n\nCeremony features the reputable 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“piece NDR Bigband (North German Radio / Norddeutscher Rundfunk) from Hamburg, and the excellent Omar Sosa Quartet, featuring Cuban drummer Julio Barreto, Mozambican bassist Childo Tomas, and Cuban percussionist Marcos IlukÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â±n. Sosa himself plays piano and marimba. Sosa's impressive body of work has deep Cuban roots, including the music batÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â± ceremonies, Cuban son, danzÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n, and cha cha chÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â±, as well as elements from Pacific Coast Afro-Colombian and Afro-Ecuadorian traditions, featuring the use of various traditional rhythms and marimbas.  \n\nThe album was recorded in two sessions (2007 and 2008) at NDR's Hamburg studios, under the direction of Morelenbaum and Sosa. Ceremony includes Morelenbaum's masterful arrangements of musical pieces from Omar Sosa's recordings Spirit of the Roots (1999), BembÃƒâ€˜Ã†â€™n (2000), and Afreecanos (2009) . In addition, two new compositions by Omar Sosa are featured, &quot;Llegada Con Elegba&quot; (Arrival with Elegba, the introductory track) and &quot;Salida Con Elegba&quot; (Departure with Elegba, the closing piece). Elegba is a Yoruba deity worshipped by some Cubans, the divine messenger and guardian spirit, the all-powerful medium and diviner of human fate.\n\nCeremony grew out of a conversation with Hamburg producer Stefan Gerdes of NDR, who brokered the connection with Jacques Morelenbaum, who is much sought after as an arranger, reflecting his signal work with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, CesÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â±ria Evora, and Mariza, among many others.\n\nThe NDR Bigband is an ensemble of accomplished soloists. JÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â rg Achim Keller is the musical director. The orchestra includes trumpeters Thorsten Benkenstein, Ingolf Burkhardt, Claus StÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â tter and Reiner Winterschladen; saxophonists Fiete Felsch (alto), Peter Bolte (alto), Christof Lauer (tenor), Lutz BÃƒâ€˜Ã…â€™chner (tenor) and Frank Delle (baritone); trombonists Dan Gottshall, Klaus Heidenreich, Stefan Lottermann and Ingo Lahme; keyboardist Vladyslav Sendecki; guitarist Stephan Diez; bassist Ingmar Heller; and percussionist Marcio Doctor.\n\nThe NDR Bigband has worked with such noted arrangers as Steve Gray, Colin Towns, and Michael Gibbs. Over the years, the NDR Bigband has recorded with the biggest names in jazz,  including Chet Baker, Paquito D'Rivera, Pee Wee Ellis, Joe Gallardo, Lionel Hampton, Dave Holland, Abdullah Ibrahim, Pat Metheny, Joe Pass, Maria Schneider, Wayne Shorter, Oscar Brown, Jr., Al Jarreau, and Bobby McFerrin.\n\nCeremony is a new masterpiece by one of the powerhouses of jazz and Afro-Cuban music.
