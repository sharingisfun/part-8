The narration is on the left channel, the music is on the right.\r\nI have no information as to its origin, this is what I received in a tape trade\r\nmany years ago. The beginning is cut and the quality is low, but I am including it\r\nhere for historical interest.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2813a8ee468b42eaff59f3f2e3952a35a9b076e","amp;dn":"Phish+-+The+Man+Who+Stepped+Into+Yesterday+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2813a8ee468b42eaff59f3f2e3952a35a9b076e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,129,58,142,228,104,180,46,175,245,159,63,46,57,82,163,90,155,7,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
