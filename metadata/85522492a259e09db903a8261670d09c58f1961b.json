Robert Baratheon, \nKing of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as \nHand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous \nHand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. \nMeanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot \nto take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous \nand deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain \nthe throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, \nand with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, \nleads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the \nfarthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected \nmilitary order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between \nthe realms of men and icy horrors beyond.\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/[/url]\n\nplease seed :P ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85522492a259e09db903a8261670d09c58f1961b","amp;dn":"Game+Of+Thrones+%28S1E2%29%282011-%29%28IPOD%2FPSP%2FZUNE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85522492a259e09db903a8261670d09c58f1961b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,82,36,146,162,89,224,157,185,3,168,38,22,112,208,156,88,241,150,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
