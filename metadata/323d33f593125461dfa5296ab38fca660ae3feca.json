It was created by Mel Bampton as part of the Mel in the Morning program. Currently the segment pops up whenever artists are available and willing to do it, though mainly on the Breakfast show. It involves Australian, and more recently, international artists playing live, acoustic versions of some of their favourite songs. This segment's popularity has led to, so far, the release of five compilation CDs.\n\nContains:\n Vol. 1\n Vol. 2\n Vol. 3\n Vol. 4\n Vol. 5\n\nAll songs should be MP3 \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:323d33f593125461dfa5296ab38fca660ae3feca","amp;dn":"Triple+J%5C%27s+Like+a+Version+1+-+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"323d33f593125461dfa5296ab38fca660ae3feca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,61,51,245,147,18,84,97,223,165,41,106,179,143,202,102,10,227,254,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
