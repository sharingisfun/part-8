Clarke's Mysterious World\n\nScience Documentary hosted by Gordon Honeycombe, published by ITV in 1980 - English narration\n\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nArthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\nDo U.F.O.s or the Loch Ness Monster really exist? Did ancient civilisations possess unsuspected scientific know-how? Can we believe the reports of the Abominable Snowman or the Great Sea Serpent? How is it that fish, frogs and seeds can fall from a clear blue sky? In this series, Arthur C. Clarke, author of 2001: A Space Odyssey investigates these and many other intriguing mysteries. This much sought-after show debunks myths and legends about some of the planetÃƒÂ­s strangest phenomena, presenting us with fascinating truths about humanity and the world in which we live. Originally broadcast on ITV in 1980, In January 2008 the original series was released on DVD in the UK by Network and Granada. It features all of the 13 original episodes unedited and remastered in Digital Quality.\n\n\n\n\n11)  Dragons Dinosaurs and Giant Snakes \nIn the old maps charted by the first explorers of land and sea, the unknown areas of the globe were often marked by ominous warnings of danger like &quot;here be dragons&quot;. Those intrepid men were the first to report on the existence of new animal species unknown to westerners until that moment. Some were captured and taken to European palaces for the amazement of kings and queens, visible symbols of a new era of discovery. Many centuries have gone by and our Earth seems smaller due to the faster means of transportation we now possess, but there are many areas in the five continents where man has never been, especially in the dense jungles of Africa and South America or in the inaccessible forests of Siberia. As contradictory as it seems, many creatures of myth may still roam the untouched places of the world.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1726 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 528\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (4:3)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 348 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke%27s_Mysterious_World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke%27s_Mysterious_World&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd6d216afc4d8f5ef0536ff473b5b9164a74025","amp;dn":"ITV+Arthur+C+Clarkes+Mysterious+World+11of13+Dragons+Dinosaurs+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd6d216afc4d8f5ef0536ff473b5b9164a74025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,214,210,22,175,196,216,245,239,5,54,255,71,59,91,145,100,167,64,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
