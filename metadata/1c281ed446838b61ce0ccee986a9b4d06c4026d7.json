CD is in perfect condition and check out that cover....she is smoking hot. Big Papi never owned this CD in the day and is totally baffled by that. Give it a listen and you'll see this group has some skills.\n\nHappy Friday!! This torrent is being super seeded. That means if you share it out it should upload within a few minutes and fully seed in your client. That means you are turbo charging the download speed for other pirates so they can grab this likely split.\n\nHave a good weekend and hope you have a nice Spring day.\n\nBoth FLAC and MP3 rips are included in this download.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Divinyls - Divinyls (Virgin 91397)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Divinyls\nAlbum................: Divinyls (Virgin 91397)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991 01 29\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 101 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
