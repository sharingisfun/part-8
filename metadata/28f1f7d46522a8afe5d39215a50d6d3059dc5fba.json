She canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take a loss; she has to do everything to the T. So itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basically like weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trying to make a greatest hits album without using the greatest hitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. In February 2009, MySpace Music interviewed The-Dream, he revealed that he and Carey had finished seven songs for the album.\n\nCarey revealed on May 20, 2009 that she was calling the album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel because it was going to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvery personal and dedicated to the fansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. She says that the reason she chose to use three images for the cover art is because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthere are a lot of different emotions and stories revealed on this albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n01.
