Digital imagery, and its applications, develops in tandem\nwith contemporary society's sophisticated literacy of this subtle medium. This\nbook examines the ways in which digital images have become ever more ubiquitous\nas legal and medical evidence, just as they have become our primary source of\nnews and have replaced paper-based financial documentation.\nCrucially, the contributions also analyze the very profound problems which have\narisen alongside the digital image, issues of veracity and progeny that demand\nsystematic and detailed response: It looks real, but is it? What camera\ncaptured it? Has it been doctored or subtly altered? Attempting to provide\nanswers to these slippery issues, the book covers how digital images are\ncreated, processed and stored before moving on to set out the latest techniques\nfor forensically examining images, and finally addressing practical issues\nsuch as courtroom admissibility. In an environment where even novice users can\nalter digital media, this authoritative publication will do much so stabilize\npublic trust in these real, yet vastly flexible, images of the world around us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399b1da486fd94b39a8279aabe5dba4fa601db4b","amp;dn":"Springer+Digital+Image+Forensics+2013+Retail+Ebook-Ke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399b1da486fd94b39a8279aabe5dba4fa601db4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,155,29,164,134,253,148,179,154,130,121,170,190,93,186,79,166,1,219,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
