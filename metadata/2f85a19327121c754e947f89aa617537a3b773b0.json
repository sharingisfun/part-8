Since then the earth is covered with the ever-growing Sea of Corruption, a vast forest of fungi that secretes poisonous miasma and invasive spores along with large and deadly insects inhabit within. In order to fight for more habitable lands unpolluted by the Sea of Corruption the Kingdom of Torumekia has declared war against the Dorok Empire. NausicaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤, princess and heir of a small city-state named Valley of the Wind, which pledged alliance with Torumekia is now forced to join the Torumekian forces to invade the Dorok Empire. This war will change her life and the fate of the human race forever.\n\nThe success of the first part of the manga paved the way to getting a NausicaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ movie made in 1984. With the funds and success of NausicaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤, Isao Takahata and Miyazaki formed Studio Ghibli a year later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f85a19327121c754e947f89aa617537a3b773b0","amp;dn":"Nausicaa+manga+in+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f85a19327121c754e947f89aa617537a3b773b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,133,161,147,39,18,28,117,78,148,127,137,170,97,117,55,163,183,115,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
