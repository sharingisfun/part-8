Through chance-met black jazzman Art Hazzard, he develops into a great trumpeter...too great for jazz-hating Jack Chandler, leader of the dance band he joins. But before long he&amp;#039;s in a better big band, thanks to the interest of sweet singer Jo Jordan, who alas introduces him to her slinky, rich, highly neurotic friend Amy North. Amy&amp;#039;s inconsistent ways soon make Rick a virtual basket case. Is he washed up, or will he find that elusive high note his trumpet won&amp;#039;t play? Based on the life of jazz great Bix Beiderbecke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:056dbe01e5530ac3096f1cca67b0bad3badb2f2f","amp;dn":"Young+Man+with+a+Horn+%5B1950%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"056dbe01e5530ac3096f1cca67b0bad3badb2f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,109,190,1,229,83,10,195,9,111,28,202,103,176,186,211,186,219,47,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
