With his career seemingly fading and the fate of a book hinging on a publisher's decision, Miles is depressed with himself and what he hasn't achieved. Jack is a television actor whom some recognize but not many do, as if he were a minor actor who got a taste of success. With his best friend Miles, the two embark on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a nice sendoff before married life, while Jack simply wants to have a fling beforehand. As they're both nearing middle age with not much to show for it, the two will explore the vineyards while ultimately searching for their identities.&quot; (mystic80)\n\nVideo: 1454kbps XVID\nAudio: 128kbps mpa\nDuration: 2:07:04\n\nPlease seed, comment, recommend movies, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa53007159404ff3eb85938a89ee028fd51523e","amp;dn":"Sideways+%282004%29+DVDrip+%28high+quality%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa53007159404ff3eb85938a89ee028fd51523e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,165,48,7,21,148,4,255,62,184,89,56,168,158,224,40,253,81,82,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
