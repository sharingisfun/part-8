As of October 2013, the BBC reported that 10 episodes previously thought lost were found at a television station in Nigeria. Once they become readily available, I will bundle them into a single torrent and seed it rather than make modifications to these torrents. But I will place comments under each season that has one of the newly found episodes so you know to download it. (I don't know how long it will take for these newly found episodes to trickle down to us viewers bu they will sooner or later.)\n \n1.  The Smugglers - Four Episodes\n    All four episodes are reconstructions\n\n2.  The Tenth Planet - Four Episodes\n    Episode 4 is a reconstruction. Also this is the final series\n    to feature William Hartnell as the Doctor. I think I have called\n    him William Hartwell in previous writeups.\n\n3.  The Power of the Daleks - Six Episodes\n    All six episodes are reconstructions. This is the first series to\n    feature Patrick Troughton as the Doctor. (Doctor #2)\n\n4.  The Highlanders - Four Episodes\n    All four episodes are reconstructions\n\n5.  The Underwater Menace - Four Episodes\n    Episodes 1 and 4 are reconstructions\n\n6.  The Moonbase - Four Episodes\n    Episodes 1 and 3 are reconstructions\n\n7.  The Macra Terror - Four Episodes\n    All four episodes are reconstructions\n\n8.  The Faceless Ones - Six Episodes\n    Episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 are reconstructions\n\n9.  The Evil of the Daleks - Seven Episodes\n    Episodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are reconstructions\n\nIf you enjoy these, please let me know. Use the comment section below. I would like to think that the Doctor Who fans will give me a thumbs up for my effort. Cheers and enjoy.  Also if you have the time, please reseed these torrents as much as you can.  It would be nice to provide these programs to as many people as possible.\n\nThanks and have a great day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee421a18328298a0c33a537ae310dab701a1e79","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Season+04+-+%281966%26ndash%3B67%29+-+43+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee421a18328298a0c33a537ae310dab701a1e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,228,33,161,131,40,41,138,12,51,165,55,174,49,13,171,112,26,30,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
