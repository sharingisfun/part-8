Between 1888 and his death he single-handedly revolutionized both the drama and the short story. Near the end of his life he married an actress, Olga Knipper. He died from tuberculosis in 1904, age 44.\n\n\n\n1st and only E-book created by ubernoober\n\n\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315bd1ef53b553d60c3d4daeb22c814e74af30f6","amp;dn":"The+Stories+of+Anton+Chekhov+-+Anton+Chekhov+%5BUber%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315bd1ef53b553d60c3d4daeb22c814e74af30f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,91,209,239,83,181,83,214,12,61,77,174,178,44,129,78,116,175,48,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
