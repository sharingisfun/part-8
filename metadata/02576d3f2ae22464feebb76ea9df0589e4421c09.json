Plus, theories surrounding the whereabouts of gold looted by the Nazis and never seen again.\n\n2)  The Nazi King \nDespite the royal family changing its name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor, many conspiracy theorists believe its allegiances remained firmly with Germany, claiming Edward VIII was a Nazi sympathiser, while his brother George tried to negotiate a secret peace treaty with Rudolf Hess. Such suggestions are scrutinised by this part-dramatised documentary, alongside claims that Princess Margaret had a love child and that the family may have had a hand in the incident that led to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\n3)  Cold War Files \nDocumentary exploring popular conspiracy theories surrounding the Cold War, including how the lies of one man, former head of intelligence for the German army Reinhard Gehlen, moved the world to within hours of nuclear destruction. Theories related to the potential devastation of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis are also examined, along with suspicions associated with the assassination of Italy's former Prime Minister Aldo Morro, who some claim was killed not by communist revolutionists but by a sinister underground army created by Nato.\n\n4)  Lord Lucan Dossier \nThe case of John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, who disappeared in November 1974, coinciding with the murder of his children's nanny Sandra Rivett. Lucan was never caught or tried for the crime, but in the four decades since he fled numerous sightings have been reported of him from around the world. Some people believe he escaped justice, while others think he too was later murdered. Other cases considered include the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles Lindbergh's baby son in 1927 and the disappearance of American union leader Jimmy Hoffa in an act some people claim was a mob-sanctioned hit.\n\n5)  The Hollywood Files \nDocumentary examining common conspiracy theories surrounding Hollywood crimes. The 2014 hacking of Sony pictures is widely regarded as a revenge attack by North Korea for satirical film The Interview, but some suggest a marketing ruse to boost ailing box-office takings as a more likely explanation. Plus, a retired member of the police department names his own father a probable murderer, and there are musings about the Church of Scientology's possible involvement in the deaths of celebrities.\n\n6)  Alien Cover Up \nDocumentary exploring conspiracy theories regarding extraterrestrial contact, including the so-called `British Roswell' case of 1979, when forester Robert Taylor returned home battered and bruised after a walk through woods in West Lothian. Insistent he had been kidnapped by a `dark sphere', his case remains the only alleged alien abduction to have been investigated by police. Plus, claims that staff at the European Space Agency have been communicating with otherworldly beings on board a spacecraft for the past 20 years.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/72/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Conspiracy-Series-1-Screen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a9e4c8c0c7e9e59a8798&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1989 Kbps\n * Video: Resolution: 1020 x 576\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size 642 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02576d3f2ae22464feebb76ea9df0589e4421c09","amp;dn":"Conspiracy+Series+1+2of6+The+Nazi+King+576p+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02576d3f2ae22464feebb76ea9df0589e4421c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,87,109,63,42,226,36,100,254,235,183,110,169,223,5,137,228,66,28,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
