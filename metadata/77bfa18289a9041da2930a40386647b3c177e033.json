In tribute to the beloved staple food, baking master Peter Reinhart reflects on the cordial couplings (wheat and yeast, starch and heat) that give us our daily bread. Try not to eat a slice.\n\nPeter Reinhart's food work began as ministry outreach and later became a full-fledged culinary and teaching career. Both an educator and lay minister, his lessons focus on both secular and spiritual education. One of his books, Bread Upon the Waters: A Pilgrimage Toward Self Discovery and Spiritual Truth is first in a series of books exploring nourishment in terms of food and one's life mission.\n\nReinhart is founder of the award-winning Brother Juniper's Bakery in Santa Rosa, California. He's now a full-time faculty member in the International Baking and Pastry Institute at Johnson and Wales University. He has also developed a line of frozen gourmet pizzas, calzones, toaster snacks and bagels for Amy's Kitchen.\n\nHis latest book is Peter ReinhartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Whole Grain Breads: New Techniques, Extraordinary Flavor.\n\n    &quot;I've spent years following directions from more than a dozen bread baking books ... I've only ended up with bread that tastes like inner tube. Peter [Reinhart] has unraveled the mystery of baking, and I now approach this intimidating subject with confidence.&quot;\n\nJames Peterson, author, Cooking\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
