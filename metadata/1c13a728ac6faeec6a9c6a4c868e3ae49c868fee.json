His last binge almost killed him, and now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reluctant resident in a treatment centre for alcoholics, surrounded by people heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure will never understand him. But Saul wants peace, and he grudgingly comes to see that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find it only through telling his story. With him, readers embark on a journey back through the life heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s led as a northern Ojibway, with all its joys and sorrows.\n\nWith compassion and insight, author Richard Wagamese traces through his fictional characters the decline of a culture and a cultural way. For Saul, taken forcibly from the land and his family when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sent to residential school, salvation comes for a while through his incredible gifts as a hockey player. But in the harsh realities of 1960s Canada, he battles obdurate racism and the spirit-destroying effects of cultural alienation and displacement.\n\nIndian Horse unfolds against the bleak loveliness of northern Ontario, all rock, marsh, bog and cedar. Wagamese writes with a spare beauty, penetrating the heart of a remarkable Ojibway man. Drawing on his great-grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mystical gift of vision, Saul Indian Horse comes to recognize the influence of everyday magic on his own life. In this wise and moving novel, Richard Wagamese shares that gift of magic with readers as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c13a728ac6faeec6a9c6a4c868e3ae49c868fee","amp;dn":"Indian+Horse+-+Richard+Wagamese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c13a728ac6faeec6a9c6a4c868e3ae49c868fee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,19,167,40,172,111,174,236,106,156,106,76,134,142,58,228,156,134,143,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
