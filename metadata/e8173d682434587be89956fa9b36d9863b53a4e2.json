I apologize for the inconvenience \r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\n* CD info\r\nBeethoven - Complete Piano Music - Artur Schnabel - Dante, 1932-47\r\n\r\n* About the recording\r\nNow this is a big one! And quite rare too. Artur Schnabel is the first pianist to record Beethoven's piano work in its entirety, starting in the 30's. Now that might seem ancient - and it is - but the remastering work from Dante (the label) is impressive and makes the whole thing listenable (now it is still a pre-war recording so don't expect crystal clear sound: there is a permanent white noise in the background).\r\nThe way Schnabel plays may seem fuzzy and not very clear, but the expressiveness is overwhelming and some parts of dazzling speed. Plus it is a considerable historical legacy!\r\n\r\n* Technicals \r\nTotal duration - 15h 55m 15s\r\nAverage bitrate - 271 kbps\r\nEncoder - FLAC 1.3.1, lossless, compression level 5\r\n\r\n\r\n* Tracks\r\nJust too many to list here! Basically everything Beethoven did for piano. If you don't mind you can see in details on Amazon here:\r\n(there seem to be other editions, but this link shows the exact box set you'll find in this torrent)\r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\nWelcome to Caudheur's Classical Catalog (CCC)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty decent collection of classical music, encoded in lossless format (FLAC).\r\n\r\nI will start to upload as much as I can, because I believe great works of art should be shared for all mankind  :)\r\n\r\nYou can visit my catalogue here:     \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Caudheur-s-Classical-Catalog-Classical-Music-Rarities\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you a pleasant listening, and don't forget to seed so that Music lives on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8173d682434587be89956fa9b36d9863b53a4e2","amp;dn":"%5BFIXED%5DBeethoven+-+Piano+Works+-+Schnabel+%281932%2C+Dante%29+%5B14+CDs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8173d682434587be89956fa9b36d9863b53a4e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,23,61,104,36,52,88,123,232,153,86,250,155,54,217,134,59,83,164,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
