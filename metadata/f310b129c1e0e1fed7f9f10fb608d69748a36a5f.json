The EP was a split EP with Einar Stray. Moddi received good critiques from the internet magazine Pitchfork for his concert at the Norwegian music festival ÃƒËœyafestivalen in 2008.\nIn the fall of 2009 Moddi recorded his first studioalbum Floriography in Greenhouse Studio in ReykjavÃƒÂ­k. The album was produced by Valgeir SigurÃƒÂ°sson. It was released on February 8, 2010 on Impeller Records. The album received very good reviews from the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten who rated it 5 out 6.\nIn January 2010 Moddi, with the band KrÃƒÂ¥kesÃƒÂ¸lv and the record label Spoon Train Audio, turned down the offer of a nomination to a stipend of 800.000 NOK from By:Larm. The reason for the rejection was that StatoilHydro was the sponsor of the stipend, which was incompatible with the artists' climate engagement.\nModdi was one of the four artists/bands who received a stipend from A-ha before A-ha's tour Ending on a High Note Tour in 2010. The stipend was on 1.000.000 NOK. The goal of the stipend was to help young, up and coming artists who wished to pursue an international career.\nOn the 3rd of January 2013, Moddi announced via his soundcloud page that a new album called &quot;Set The House On Fire&quot; is ready for release and presented the first single from the album, &quot;House By The Sea&quot;, with a release date of the 11th of January.\n\n\nGenre: Post-Rock/indie-Folk\nQuality: VBR V0\nTracklist:\n01 - Heim.mp3\n02 - House by the Sea.mp3\n03 - Let the Spider Run Alive.mp3\n04 - Soon You'll Be Somebody Else!.mp3\n05 - For an Unborn.mp3\n06 - The Architect.mp3\n07 - Run to the Water.mp3\n08 - Silhouette.mp3\n09 - One Minute More.mp3\n10 - Heim Igjen.mp3\n11 - Northern Line.mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f310b129c1e0e1fed7f9f10fb608d69748a36a5f","amp;dn":"%282013%29+Moddi+%26ndash%3B+Set+The+House+On+Fire+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f310b129c1e0e1fed7f9f10fb608d69748a36a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,16,177,41,193,224,225,254,215,249,241,15,182,8,214,151,72,163,106,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
