Levi, then a 25-year-old chemist, spent 10 months in the camp. Even Levi's most graphic descriptions of the horrors he witnessed and endured there are marked by a restraint and wit that not only gives readers access to his experience, but confronts them with it in stark ethical and emotional terms: &quot;[A]t dawn the barbed wire was full of children's washing hung out in the wind to dry. Nor did they forget the diapers, the toys, the cushions and the hundred other small things which mothers remember and which children always need. Would you not do the same? If you and your child were going to be killed tomorrow, would you not give him something to eat today?&quot;\n\n\nThis, to me, is one of the most powerful and moving accounts of survival ever written.  Primo Levi's voice is dry and almost unemotional - matter of fact, even - and that makes the account even more moving.  I try to reread this book every couple of years - the author is a poet of truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b02ecf98f8de8b83bd67b9be53d8cc9ff104b5","amp;dn":"Primo+Levi+-+Survival+in+Auschwitz+%28epub%2Cmobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b02ecf98f8de8b83bd67b9be53d8cc9ff104b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,176,46,207,152,248,222,139,131,189,103,185,190,83,216,204,159,241,4,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
