But to the people of the Arab and Islamic worlds, the picture is dramatically different. Legends of the Fire Spirits looks beyond Westernized caricatures to immerse the reader in the vibrant lore of the jinnÃ¢â‚¬â€the wondrous, often troublesome, and sometimes terrifying spirit beings of ancient Arab and Islamic tradition.\n\nRobert Lebling delves into long-lost accounts, medieval histories, colonial records, anthropologistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reports, and travelerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tales to explore the origin and evolution of legends that continue to thrive in the Middle East and beyond. He cuts through centuries of OrientalistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cultural presumption to craft a study that stands apart from the overwhelming body of literature concerned with religion in the Middle East.\n\nA captivating synthesis of history and folklore, this is the most diverse collection of jinn lore ever assembled in one volume. From ancient scriptures to The Arabian Nights and beyond, and with a foreword by acclaimed filmmaker Tahir Shah, Lebling has constructed a comprehensive account that not only transcends geographical borders but also spans some four millennia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b11dbf7b110dce1e0b038ac3f25f2f832d177cc","amp;dn":"Legends+of+the+Fire+Spirits%3A+Jinn+and+Genies+from+Arabia+to+Zanz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b11dbf7b110dce1e0b038ac3f25f2f832d177cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,17,219,247,177,16,220,225,224,176,56,172,63,37,242,248,50,209,119,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
