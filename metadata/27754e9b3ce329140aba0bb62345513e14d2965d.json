Released on 19 October 1973 by Track and Polydor in the United Kingdom, and Track and MCA in the United States, it is a double album, and the group's second rock opera. Its story involves social, musical and psychological happenings from an English teenage perspective, set in London and Brighton in 1965.\n\nThe name is a variation on the popular usage of the medical diagnostic term schizophrenia as dissociative identity disorder, to reflect the four distinct personalities of Jimmy, the opera's protagonist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each said to represent the personality of one member of The Who. At the same time, the title is a play on the term quadraphonic sound, then a recent invention. Composer Pete Townshend has said: &quot;The whole conception of Quadrophenia was geared to quadraphonic, but in a creative sort of way. I mean I wanted themes to sort of emerge from corners. So you start to get the sense of the fourness being literally speaker for speaker.&quot; \n\nQuadrophenia: The Director's Cut\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n01. \t&quot;I Am The Sea&quot;   \t2:08\n02. \t&quot;The Real Me&quot;   \t3:20\n03. \t&quot;Quadrophenia&quot;   \t6:13\n04. \t&quot;Cut My Hair&quot;   \t3:44\n05. \t&quot;The Punk and the Godfather&quot;   \t5:10\n06. \t&quot;I'm One&quot;   \t2:37\n07. \t&quot;The Dirty Jobs&quot;   \t4:28\n08. \t&quot;Helpless Dancer (Roger's theme)&quot;   \t2:33\n09. \t&quot;Is It In My Head?&quot;   \t3:43\n10. \t&quot;I've Had Enough&quot;   \t6:14\n\nDisc 2\n\t\n01. \t&quot;5.15&quot;   \t5:00\n02. \t&quot;Sea and Sand&quot;   \t5:01\n03. \t&quot;Drowned&quot;   \t5:26\n04. \t&quot;Bell Boy (Keith's theme)&quot;   \t4:55\n05. \t&quot;Doctor Jimmy (John's theme)&quot;   \t8:36\n06. \t&quot;The Rock&quot;   \t6:37\n07. \t&quot;Love, Reign O'er Me (Pete's theme)&quot;   \t5:48\n\nDisc 3\n\n01. \t&quot;The Real Me&quot;   \twritten and recorded in October 1972 \t \n02. \t&quot;Quadrophenia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Four Overtures&quot;   \tin 1973 \t \n03. \t&quot;Cut My Hair&quot;   \twritten in June 1972 \t \n04. \t&quot;Fill No. 1 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Get Out and Stay Out&quot;   \t12 November 1972 \t \n05. \t&quot;Quadrophenic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Four Faces&quot;   \tin July 1972 \t \n06. \t&quot;We Close Tonight&quot;   \tin July 1972 \t \n07. \t&quot;You Came Back&quot;   \tin July 1972 \t \n08. \t&quot;Get Inside&quot;   \twritten in April 1972 \t \n09. \t&quot;Joker James&quot;   \tin July 1972 \t \n10. \t&quot;Ambition&quot; 0early in 1972 \t \n11. \t&quot;Punk&quot;   \t18 November 1972 \t \n12. \t&quot;I'm One&quot;   \t15 November 1972 \t \n13. \t&quot;Dirty Jobs&quot;   \t25 July 1972 \t \n14. \t&quot;Helpless Dancer&quot;   \tin 1973 \t \n\nDisc 4\n\t\n01. \t&quot;Is It In My Head?&quot;   \t30 April 1972 \t \n02. \t&quot;Anymore&quot;   \t 1972 \t \n03. \t&quot;I've Had Enough&quot;   \twritten and recorded on 17 December 1972 \t \n04. \t&quot;Fill No. 2&quot;   \t12 November 1972 \t \n05. \t&quot;Wizardry&quot;   \tin August 1972 \t \n06. \t&quot;Sea And Sand&quot;   \twritten and recorded on 1 November 1972 \t \n07. \t&quot;Drowned&quot;   \tin March 1970 \t \n08. \t&quot;Is It Me?&quot;   \t20 March 1973 \t \n09. \t&quot;Bell Boy&quot;   \t3 March 1973 \t \n10. \t&quot;Doctor Jimmy&quot;   \t27 July 1972 \t \n11. \t&quot;Finale Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Rock&quot;   \tbetween 25 March and 1 May 1973 \t \n12. \t&quot;Love Reign O'er Me&quot;   \t10 May 1972","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27754e9b3ce329140aba0bb62345513e14d2965d","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Quadrophenia+%5BDirector%27s+Cut%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27754e9b3ce329140aba0bb62345513e14d2965d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,117,78,155,60,227,41,20,10,186,11,182,35,69,81,62,20,210,150,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
