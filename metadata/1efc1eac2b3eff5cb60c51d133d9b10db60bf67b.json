With unprecedented access to key sources and his great gift for storytelling, Bowden takes us inside the rooms where decisions were made and on the ground where the action unfolded. The story focuses on Bin Laden, who maintained a stream of despairing correspondence in hiding in the year before his death, and on President Obama, perceived by many as an anti-war candidate, whose evolving views and enormous responsibilities have turned him into one of the most determined warriors to ever inhabit the White House.\n\nBowden's book is an unrivaled account of the most high-profile special-forces operation ever to have been undertaken, and a pause-resistant narrative of how the man behind 9/11 was finally brought to justice.\n\nÃ‚Â©2012 Mark Bowden (P)2012 Audible, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1efc1eac2b3eff5cb60c51d133d9b10db60bf67b","amp;dn":"The+Finish%3A+The+Killing+of+Osama+bin+Laden+-+Mark+Bowden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1efc1eac2b3eff5cb60c51d133d9b10db60bf67b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,252,30,172,43,62,255,92,182,12,81,209,51,217,177,13,182,11,246,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
