While Carrack's voice certainly had crossover appeal -- as he would later prove with his own records, as well as his work with Squeeze and Roxy Music -- the band was also less devoted to the three-chord boogie and country-rock that marked most pub rock bands, favoring soulful R&amp;B. And while they did have hits, their time in the spotlight was brief, and they fell apart shortly after Carrack left for a solo career. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.64% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSee For Miles\nCatalog:\t\tSEE CD 214\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.How Long\n02.I'm A Man\n03.Ain't Gonna Stand For This No More\n04.Rock 'N' Roll Runaway\n05.The Real Feeling\n06.Rock And Roll Singer\n07.You're All That I Need\n08.24 Hours\n09.Crazy World\n10.No Future In Your Eyes\n11.Tongue Tied\n12.Time Ain't Long\n13.Sail On My Brother\n14.I Think It's Gonna Last\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30173813a707ae525bdb970564c8e89ae807799b","amp;dn":"Ace+-+The+Best+Of+%28Feat.+Paul+Carrack%29+%281987%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30173813a707ae525bdb970564c8e89ae807799b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,23,56,19,167,7,174,82,91,219,151,5,100,200,232,154,232,7,121,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
