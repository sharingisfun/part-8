Occurring during the era of the Third French Republic (beginning 1870), it was a period characterized by optimism, peace at home and in Europe, new technology and scientific discoveries. The peace and prosperity in Paris allowed the arts to flourish, and many masterpieces of literature, music, theater, and visual art gained recognition. The Belle Ãƒâ€°poque was named, in retrospect, when it began to be considered a &quot;golden age&quot; in contrast to the horrors of World War I.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1cb25b78f522b4f80f09f24f6b1963f7f2b4ece","amp;dn":"The+Belle+%26Eacute%3Bpoque+-+65+French+Posters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1cb25b78f522b4f80f09f24f6b1963f7f2b4ece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,203,37,183,143,82,43,79,128,240,159,36,246,177,150,63,127,43,78,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
