It was the most commonly used member of the DOS\nfamily of operating systems and was the main operating system for personal\ncomputers during the 1980s. It was based on the Intel 8086 family of\nmicroprocessors, particularly the IBM PC and compatibles. It was gradually\nreplaced on consumer desktop computers by operating systems offering a\ngraphical user interface (GUI), in particular by various generations of the\nMicrosoft Windows operating system and Linux.\n\nThis torrent contains images of the 3 original floppy install diskettes for\nMS-DOS v6.22, released in April, 1994. It was the last stand-alone MS-DOS\nversion before the release of Windows 95.\n\n\nNorton Commander (commonly shortened to &quot;NC&quot;) was a prototypical orthodox\nfile manager (OFM), written by John Socha and released by Peter Norton\nComputing (later acquired by the Symantec corporation). NC is a file manager\nwhich essentially acts as the text user interface for DOS. It was officially\nproduced by Symantec between 1986 and 1998. The last DOS version of Norton\nCommander, 5.51, was released on July 1, 1998.\n\nSince this program was considered as a must-have for MS-DOS user it is also\nincluded in this torrent. Included version is 5.51, and just like MS-DOS,\nincluded are the images of the 3 original floppy install diskettes.\n\n\nDownload speed will be a bit slow until there are few seeders.\nBe sure to seed after you have finished downloading, at least\nuntil your ratio is 1.000, to keep this torrent alive.\nThink about other downloaders.\n\n\nCheck out my other torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Eqa5cro&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Eqa5cro&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61c73704644050c693879a37b778693a6f617b4f","amp;dn":"MS-DOS+v6.22+%26+Norton+Commander+v5.51+for+DOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61c73704644050c693879a37b778693a6f617b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,199,55,4,100,64,80,198,147,135,154,55,183,120,105,58,111,97,123,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
