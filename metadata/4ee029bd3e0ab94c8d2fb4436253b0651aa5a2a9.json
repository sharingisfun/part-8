The focus is on guiding students toward a basic understanding of the research process, allowing them to develop the skills, knowledge and strategies needed to read, interpret, and evaluate the quality of research reports. The text provides balanced coverage of quantitative, qualitative, and combined research approaches.\n\nFrom reviews of the book:\n\n&quot;The structure of the book is great. [The authors use] language that helps the reader become engaged and invites them to start applying what they have learned to their situation immediately. The examples of the journal articles with the notations are very helpful and we use these for discussion in the class quite a bit. I also like the 'reviewing what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned' and 'practicing your skills' at the end of the chapter. I much prefer the consumer approach of this text over others on the market.&quot;\n-- Candyce Reynolds, Portland State University\n\n&quot;Understanding Research is true to its name; it is much more user friendly, it explains WHAT research IS. It does an EXCELLENT job of covering all of the material I currently cover. [The authors] (fortunately) force me to provide a balanced, comparative description of both [quantitative and qualitative] research. . . . I find the writing style to be clear, interesting and engaging. &quot; \n-- Carol A. Friesen, Ball State University\n\nNew Interactive, Multimedia Learning Features\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Practice reading research articles.
