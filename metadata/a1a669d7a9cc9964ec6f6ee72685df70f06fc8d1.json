It is indisputably the album on which her musical legacy rests, and rightly considered one of the greatest albums of all time. A sophisticated mÃƒÂªlÃƒÂ©e of sound, blending post-punk cool with a hot Caribbean vibe and a catwalk Studio 54 sensibility, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a perfect example of artist and musicians working in complete accord. It contains the all-time Grace classics in Ã¢â‚¬ËœPull Up To The BumperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWalking In The RainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDemolition ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (written by Sting) and of course the Bowie / Iggy Pop-penned title track. There is magic in its every groove.&quot;\n\n\nDisc: 1\n1. Walking in the Rain (2014 Remaster)\n2. Pull Up to the Bumper (2014 Remaster)\n3. Use Me (2014 Remaster)\n4.
