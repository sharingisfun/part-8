But its about to come crashing to an end. See, Marlowe is dying - maybe today, maybe tomorrow, the only question is when. But Marlowe isnt about to go quietly into the night. Before he goes, he intends to leave the world a safer place for his family. And if that means hunting down - and murdering - every supervillain he can, so be it. They don't call him Destroyer for nothing.
