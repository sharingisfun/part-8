The game will go full screen when the Campaign is launched :)\n\nNo support for Widescreen... YET!.\nBut im working on it :)\n\n\nENJOY!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f61423d2890ec2e80105a6f5b533f227a96850e","amp;dn":"%5B++Dungeon+Keeper+2++-++for+Mac++%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f61423d2890ec2e80105a6f5b533f227a96850e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,97,66,61,40,144,236,46,128,16,90,111,91,83,63,34,122,150,133,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
