He claims that he and the FBI have the same interests: bringing down dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will co-operate, but insists that he will speak only to Elizabeth Keen, a rookie FBI profiler. Keen questions Reddington's sudden interest in her, though he claims that Keen is very special. After the FBI brings down a terrorist he provided information on, Reddington reveals that the terrorist is only just the first of many. In the last two decades, he's made a list of criminals and terrorists he believes the FBI cannot find because they did not know they exist and that they matter the most.
