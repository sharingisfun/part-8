But Vincent isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like most children his age. Ã¢â‚¬Å“While other kids read books like Ã¢â‚¬ËœGo Jane GoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½, Price informs us, Ã¢â‚¬Å“VincentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite author is Edgar Allan PoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Preferring to think of himself as a tortured mad scientist, Vincent imagines experimenting on his dog, which he hopes to turn into a Ã¢â‚¬Å“horrible zombieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and dipping his Aunt in wax to put her on display in his museum. His mother tells him to spend more time outside, but seeing as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such a tormented soul, Vincent would rather be alone, pining for the beloved wife he accidentally buried alive!\n\nRip Specs (HD TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Vincent.1982.HQTV.720p.x264.AC3.[FrOnkY].mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 3 554 Kbps\nLength            : 150 MiB for 5mn 54s 208ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 333 Kbps\nAspect            : 1064 x 720 (1.478) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084868/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084868/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: Spanish, English, French, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988ad8bbce2bb1d4896f7b780dea048d1b5ee2d9","amp;dn":"Vincent.1982.HQTV.720p.x264.AC3.%5BFrOnkY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988ad8bbce2bb1d4896f7b780dea048d1b5ee2d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,138,216,187,206,43,177,212,137,111,123,120,13,234,4,141,27,94,226,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
