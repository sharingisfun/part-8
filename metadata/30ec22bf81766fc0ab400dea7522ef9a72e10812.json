He records and tours with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey.[2]\n\nSpringsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band perform intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories.\n\nHis most successful studio albums, Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A., epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life in America, and the latter album made him one of the most recognized artists of the 1980s within the United States. Because of his support for the presidential campaigns of Senator John Kerry and Senator Barack Obama, Springsteen has gradually become identified with liberal politics.[3] He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11th attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects.[4]\n\nHe has earned numerous awards for his work, including nineteen Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award, and continues to have a strong global fan base. He has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and 120 million worldwide\n[/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]Greatest Hits [/b] 1995\n\n\n[URL=http://img44.imageshack.us/i/brucespringsteengreates.jpg/][IMG]http://img44.imageshack.us/img44/5042/brucespringsteengreates.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\nGreatest Hits is Bruce Springsteen's first compilation album, released February 27, 1995 on Columbia Records. It is a collection of some of Springsteen's hit singles and popular album tracks through the years and four extra numbers at the end, mostly recorded with the E Street Band in 1995. The latter constituted Springsteen's first (albeit very partial) release with his backing band since the late 1980s. Some of the songs are shorter versions of the original album releases.\n\nThe incorporation of the &quot;new&quot; tracks was portrayed in the 1996 documentary Blood Brothers. &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; and &quot;This Hard Land&quot; were, in fact, unused 1982 songs from the Born in the U.S.A. sessions, with the latter being re-recorded here more than a decade later, and both subsequently became Springsteen concert staples.[1] &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, on the other hand, was played only as the final closing song of both the 1999-2000 Reunion Tour and 2002-2003 Rising Tour, both times with an extra verse added. &quot;Secret Garden&quot; achieved notoriety via the soundtrack of the 1996 film Jerry Maguire. Alternate versions of several of these new tracks were released on the 1996 Blood Brothers EP.\n\nThe compilation was commercially successful, hitting the peaks of the U.S. album chart and UK Album Chart and selling more than four million copies in the U.S.\n\n\nTracks\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Born to Run&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born to Run.)\n\n2.\t&quot;Thunder Road&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born to Run.)\n\n3.\t&quot;Badlands&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \no\t(Originally released on the album Darkness on the Edge of Town.)\n\n4.\t&quot;The River&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00 \no\t(Originally released on the album The River.)\n\n5.\t&quot;Hungry Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20 \no\t(Originally released on the album The River.)\n\n6.\t&quot;Atlantic City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 \no\t(Originally released on the album Nebraska.)\n\n7.\t&quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born in the U.S.A.)\n\n8.\t&quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born in the U.S.A.)\n\n9.\t&quot;My Hometown&quot; (early fade edit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born in the U.S.A.)\n\n10.\t&quot;Glory Days&quot; (early fade edit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 \no\t(Originally released on the album Born in the U.S.A.)\n\n11.\t&quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15 \no\t(Originally released on the album Tunnel of Love.)\n\n12.\t&quot;Human Touch&quot; (edit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10 \no\t(Originally released on the album Human Touch.)\n\n13.\t&quot;Better Days&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44 \no\t(Originally released on the album Lucky Town.)\n\n14.\t&quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; (single edit) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16 \no\t(Originally released on the soundtrack to Philadelphia.)\n\n15.\t&quot;Secret Garden&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27 \no\tRecorded in January 1995 at The Hit Factory, New York City\n\n16.\t&quot;Murder Incorporated&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57 \no\tRecorded at The Power Station in April/May 1982\n\n17.\t&quot;Blood Brothers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34 \no\tRecorded in January 1995 at The Hit Factory, New York City\n\n18.\t&quot;This Hard Land&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50 \no\tRecorded in January 1995 at The Hit Factory, New York City\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30ec22bf81766fc0ab400dea7522ef9a72e10812","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Greatest+Hits+1995+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30ec22bf81766fc0ab400dea7522ef9a72e10812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,236,34,191,129,118,111,192,171,64,13,234,117,34,239,154,114,225,8,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
