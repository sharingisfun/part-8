F. Benson is perhaps best known today for his delightful series of books featuring Emmeline Lucas (Lucia) and her social rival, Elizabeth Mapp. Published in the 1930&amp;#039;s, the stories are set primarily in Rye (called Tilling) after beginning in Broadway in the Cotswolds (called Riseholme). The books portray the rivalries, plots and melodramas of small town life and are rich in descriptions of settings immediately recognisable to anyone who has walked the streets of Rye. The Mapp and Lucia stories were filmed in ten one-hour segments for television in the 1980s and have recently been made available for purchase in UK and US video formats.\n\n(www.rye-tourism.co.uk/efbenson)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1d1f4e1daf44a60f6e67acf01b674e67b20832","amp;dn":"E.F.+Benson%5C%27s+Mapp+and+Lucia+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1d1f4e1daf44a60f6e67acf01b674e67b20832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,29,31,78,29,175,68,166,15,110,103,172,240,27,103,78,103,178,8,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
