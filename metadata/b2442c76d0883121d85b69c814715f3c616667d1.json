Vile and Ve couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand the reason why, but Odin knew what man needed! Odin gathered all of his might and with all the powers of the world he cast onto the world of Midgaard a band of hearty Vikings. These brave men and women called themselves Vanir! And they decided to help man through the power of mead, meat, fornication, and metal! Vanir, named for divine lineage of Njord, Freja, and Frej, had their task blessed by the gods, as they demanded that the metal be played loud enough for even OdinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throne, Lidskjalv, to tremble. Vanir journeyed on to share their folkmetal with MidgaardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people and to create feasts of such magnitude that they would be heard from Udgaard to Asgaard until the the day the Gjallerhorn would be heard!\nWith a varied range of musical backgrounds ranging from Black Metal (Martin, Phillip, Mike), Funk (Lars), Classical, Death Metal, and Opera (Andreas) to traditional Norse Irish and Scottish Folk Music (Amanda, Sara) Vanir sets out to create Folk Metal with a great focus on the Folk-based qualities of the music.\n\nOut inspiration is gotten from the many folk tales that we have grown up with, and with an at times pretty alcoholized interpretation of myths and legends, the many tales of VanirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs spring forth and make the frame of the shows with which Vanir raids and pillages the venues that they play.\nVanir creates the soundtrack for any party which should end in crazed drunkenness, and any raid which should end in glorious victory! We do not compromise with the folk aspect of our music and have a great respect for our ancestors, and the myths which we interpret through the music. But we also view them beyond their warrior-like qualities. Aside from being strong, proud, and brutal on the field of battle, they were also capricious had a lust for feasts and at times thoroughly smashed. Our goal at any show of ours is to tear the roof from the venue (figuratively speaking), and to show the gods that among our fans, even today, there are still Vikings worthy of sitting at the tables of Valhalla, feast on SÃƒÂ¦rimnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flesh, drink of SuttingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mead and call themselves Einherjar of the Gods!\n\nVanir are on album number three with The Glorious Dead and things have definitely changed a bit: thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only guttural growls now as opposed to the lighter, less harsh vocals heard on their Onwards Into Battle offering. The guitars are more savage, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ bagpipes? Yeah, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a thing for Vanir now and they have a female bagpipe player. Their name comes from a group of gods in Norse mythology, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obvious youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re gonna be hearing about vikings and battles and for a for a Scandinavian act, this is just what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect, even if the album art looks like something from a Warcraft game cover.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right down to business with Vanir, and that means meat and potatoes Viking folk: thick guitars, thundering drums and growls to go with it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very straight forward musically, but you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complain as everyone is well-versed in their respective instruments. Guitarists Philip Kaabar and Lasse GuldbÃƒÂ¦k Jensen are a tight duo who lock up with drummer Daniel Ã¢â‚¬ËœLuskeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Kronskov, who is just as energetic and tight as the stringsmen. Vocalist Martin Holmsgaard HÃƒÂ¥kan sits in the middle of everything, spewing standard battle chants, simple, but with enough melody to stick in your head. Overall, their semi-polished, but heavy sound leaves a good impression.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nSÃƒÂ¦rimners kÃƒÂ¸d     2011\nOnwards into Battle     2012\nThe Glorious Dead     2014\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nAndreas - Lead Vocals - keys\nSara - Bagpipes - whistles\nLars - Bass\nPhillip - Rhytm Guitar\nMartin - Drums - backing vocals\nLasse - Lead Guitar\n\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist: Vanir\nAlbum: The Glorious Dead\nGenre: Viking Metal\nSubGenre:  Blackened Folk Metal\nCountry Of Origin: Denmark\nRelease date: October 20th, 2014\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: CBR 320 kbps\nSize: 111.74 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
