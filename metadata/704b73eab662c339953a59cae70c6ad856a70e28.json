Jim Ellison was one the greatest song writers of the late 80's and early 90's, and his band rocked big time. With influences ranging from the Raspberries, Cheap Trick, the Jam, Beatles, the Sweet, and Thin Lizzy. This album, the band's debut, is one pop hit after another, with killer rock tunes like &quot;Diane&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Valerie Loves Me&quot;, and the amazing ballad &quot;A Very Good Idea&quot;.\n\nTracklist  \n\n\n1\t Valerie Loves Me\t \n2\t Diane\t \n3\t Renee Remains The Same\t \n4\t This Letter\t \n5\t Out Right Now\t \n6\t Crazy\t \n7\t Chance Of A Lifetime\n8\t International Pop Overthrow\n9\t Very First Lie\t\n10\t Trouble\t\n11\t There Was A Few\t \n12\t This Far Before\t \n13\t A Very Good Idea\t\n14\t Li'l Christine\t\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704b73eab662c339953a59cae70c6ad856a70e28","amp;dn":"Material+Issue+-+International+Pop+Overthrow++%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704b73eab662c339953a59cae70c6ad856a70e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,75,115,234,182,98,195,57,149,58,89,202,231,12,106,216,86,167,14,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
