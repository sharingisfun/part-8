Bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts completed the early lineup. American R&amp;B and blues cover songs dominated The Rolling Stones' early material, but from the start they have included rock and roll in their repertoire. They are credited for raising the international regard for the primitive blues typified by Chess Records' artists such as Willie Dixon and Muddy Waters, the latter of whom wrote the song &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, after which the band is named.[1]\n\nJones initially led the band, but after teaming as songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership. By 1969 Jones had lost interest in guitar, and despite becoming the band's utility player playing recorder, marimbas and sitar among other instruments, his contributions to the band were less and less frequent. Because he was legally barred from entering the United States, nor in good enough health to tour, by mutual agreement Jones left the band, and Mick Taylor replaced him. Within weeks of leaving the band, Jones drowned. Taylor quit in 1974 and was replaced by Ronnie Wood. Wyman retired from the band in 1990, and his replacement Darryl Jones became the primary bassist, but not a full member. Stewart was taken from the official lineup in 1963 to continue as the band's road manager and occasional keyboardist until his death in 1985. Chuck Leavell has been the primary keyboardist for the band.\n\nAfter gaining popularity in Europe, The Rolling Stones became successful in North America during the so-called British Invasion of the mid 1960s. They have released 22 studio albums in the United Kingdom (24 in the United States), eight concert albums (nine in the US) and numerous compilations; their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums.[2] Sticky Fingers (1971) began a string of eight consecutive studio albums reaching number one in the United States. Their most recent album of entirely new material, A Bigger Bang, was released in 2005. In 1989 the Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004 they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[3] In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot;, and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump Back 2009\n\n\n\nJump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones is the sixth official compilation album by The Rolling Stones and was initially released worldwide, except in North America, in 1993. The North American release came on 24 August 2004.\n\nThe first Rolling Stones compilation packaged in the Compact Disc era, Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones stretches from 1971's Sticky Fingers to then-most recent studio album Steel Wheels in 1989.\n\nThe very first release under their contract with Virgin Records in November 1993 (while Voodoo Lounge was being recorded), Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones reached #16 in the UK and became an enduring seller.[citation needed] Despite its very belated release in the US in 2004, it managed to peak at #30 and go platinum.[citation needed]\n \nIn 2009 Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones was remastered and reissued by Universal Music\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Start Me Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n2.\t&quot;Brown Sugar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n3.\t&quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; (Bob Relf, Ernest Nelson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n4.\t&quot;It's Only Rock 'n Roll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n5.\t&quot;Mixed Emotions&quot; (Single version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n6.\t&quot;Angie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n7.\t&quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n8.\t&quot;Fool to Cry&quot; (Single version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n9.\t&quot;Rock and a Hard Place&quot; (Single version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n10.\t&quot;Miss You&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49 (3:35 on early pressings)\n11.\t&quot;Hot Stuff&quot; (Single version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n12.\t&quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n13.\t&quot;Respectable&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n14.\t&quot;Beast of Burden&quot; (Single version) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n15.\t&quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n16.\t&quot;Wild Horses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:43\n17.\t&quot;Bitch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n18.\t&quot;Undercover of the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e736fc8113d7d9aa0466d4f5f1cb631829dc7e4","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Jump+Back+%28Greatest+Hits%29+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e736fc8113d7d9aa0466d4f5f1cb631829dc7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,115,111,200,17,61,125,154,160,70,109,79,95,28,182,49,130,157,199,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
