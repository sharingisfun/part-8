Soon she fell ill and the family were forced into the Lambeth Workhouse - an experience which left an indelible impression on the young boy. Music Hall was his saviour; its rise in popularity was accelerated when the working week in factories was reduced to 60 hours and a teenage Charlie discovered his abilities as a natural clown. Whilst touring America in 1912 with Fred Karno's Music Hall Company, Chaplin was spotted by Mack Sennet, creator of the Keystone Kops and was offered a job. Join Mark as he charts Chaplin's course through 20th century history, how through the initial success of the Little Tramp character he managed to negotiate the right to direct his own films and how this character came to be seen as a symbol of resistance to the regimented rules of modern society. He transformed the way comedy films were made, taking control of every aspect of the production process; he taught himself to read music so he could write his own film scores; He even insisted on having a pool of 21 trained studio dogs, all of whom were well versed in the art of comic timing....\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1537 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 18\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec725c5d9db930686c3bbd4df2c3b7fd85f4c7c8","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Mark+Steel+Lectures+Series+1+to+3+14of18+Charlie+Chaplin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec725c5d9db930686c3bbd4df2c3b7fd85f4c7c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,114,92,93,157,185,48,104,108,59,189,77,242,195,183,253,133,244,199,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
