The album was released in April 1994, four years after Primus debuted with Frizzle Fry. The band followed the album with a short tour, opening for Helmet and Rollins Band. With Claypool's signature intricate bass lines and droning nasal lyrics, this album sounds much like early 1990s Primus.\n\nAll music written by Sausage.
