I included a video showing how i installed and tested... you dont have to download it if you want to save space.\n\n\n[EDIT]\n\nI found out how to make the Flaming Cliff update to work without the CD Key...\nThanks to thepiratebay guys commenting on it so i post it on here.\n\nDo this steps in the exact order and you should be up and running:\n\n1) mount Lock on 1.0 and install\n2) update to 1.02 --- VERY IMPORTANT\n3) mount Flaming Cliff 1.1 and install\n4) update to 1.12b GOLD EURO edition -- VERY IMPORTANT TOO.\n\nafter that should run perfectly... if not, do all the steps exactly the same but install Anti-Blaxx 1.18... in the settings point to the game executable and also point to the daemon executable... use the Securerom 7 emulation. (I did not need to do this in order to work but until now I heard a lot of people saying it worked that way, even though i figured out that it was because of the patch and not the program itself)\n\nIn my torrent I used the web edition which will not work.\nTo download the gold euro go to http://lockon.co.uk/\nthen go to files &gt; downloads and go to flamming cliffs updates.\n\nYou have to be registered to do that.\n\nIf you dont want to register download it from here:\nhttp://www.4shared.com/file/97472276/ad0c16c1/FC_Patch_112__Gold-Euro_.html\n\nI uploaded the version from lockon.co.uk.\n\nWell thats the basic info...\n\nGood sites to visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flankertraining.com/ironhand/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flankertraining.com/ironhand/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lockonfiles.com/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lockonfiles.com/index.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/cfrm/f/13610606&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/cfrm/f/13610606&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPersonal Note:\n\nIf you like this game then consider purchasing it... this game is too good, and there is much work involved in it. Help the development!!\n\nI uploaded it because I also was out of money a lot of times so if you download PLEASE SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:703eb49792f9a36e13e3395e30caf141b8ad4e75","amp;dn":"Lock+on+%2B+Flamming+Cliffs+%2B+updates+%2B+Mods+%28Works+on+Daemon+tool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"703eb49792f9a36e13e3395e30caf141b8ad4e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,62,180,151,146,249,163,110,19,227,57,94,48,202,241,65,184,173,78,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
