The Rolling Stones were also instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the more primitive blues typified by John Lee Hooker and by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named. American music critic Robert Palmer said the Rolling Stones' &quot;remarkable endurance&quot; stems from being &quot;rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music&quot; while &quot;more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone&quot;.\n\nThe first settled line-up had Brian Jones on guitar and harmonica, Ian Stewart on piano, Mick Jagger on lead vocals and harmonica, Keith Richards on guitar and backing vocals, Bill Wyman on bass and Charlie Watts on drums. Jones left the band about a month prior to his death in 1969, and was replaced by Mick Taylor, who was replaced by Ronnie Wood in 1975. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, bassist Darryl Jones has been a collaborator rather than an actual band member.\n\nThey were considered to be symbols of rebellious youth in their mid-1960s heyday, and were portrayed as the &quot;Anti-Beatles&quot;. During this time they scored a string of hit singles, many reaching the top of the international charts, particularly in the UK and US. They received a great deal of backlash upon the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), created as a reaction to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Into the late 1960s and early 1970s the band released Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972). This string of four albums is considered to be the band's &quot;Golden Age&quot;, and generally regarded as their finest work. After a period of criticism during the mid-1970s, they revived their commercial fortunes and popular appeal with 1978's Some Girls, their best-selling studio album. Since this time through band friction and solo projects, they have released material less frequently, but have remained commercially popular and continue to embark on highly successful worldwide tours.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list and their estimated album sales are above 200 million. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Sticky Fingers (1971) was their first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the United States. In 2008 the Rolling Stones ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart. In 2012, they celebrated their 50th Anniversary with the release of new Greatest Hits album GRRR! featuring two new singles, including chart hit &quot;Doom and Gloom&quot;. In 2013, along with Arctic Monkeys and Mumford &amp; Sons, they headlined Glastonbury.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Girls is the 14th British and 16th American studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1978 on Rolling Stones Records, catalogue COC 39108. It peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200, and became one of the band's biggest-selling albums in the United States, and has been certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, with many reviewers calling it a classic return to form, and their best album since 1972's Exile on Main St.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c03e8b8b6efd4010cdd7db50ff07983207cf361","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+Some+Girls+%5B2CD%27s%5D%5B1978%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c03e8b8b6efd4010cdd7db50ff07983207cf361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,3,232,184,182,239,212,1,12,221,125,181,15,240,121,131,32,124,243,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
