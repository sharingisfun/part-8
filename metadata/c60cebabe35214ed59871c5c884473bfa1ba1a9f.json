I'm interested in exploring tougher sounds, even ugly sounds... trying to find something more raw than the voice that I have now, and in the accompaniment that I have become used to.&quot; \n\nProduct Description\nOn Standing on the Rooftop there's one very interesting collaborator that may have the key to opening new doors is the Rolling Stones', Bill Wyman, whom Peyroux met at the Nice Jazz Festival while waiting to hear B.B. King, and the two then began writing together. A strong point for Peyroux this year was performing their song for the children of a displaced persons' camp in Port-au-Prince, Haiti this summer. The song, entitled 'The Kind You Can't Afford', Peyroux says, is a testament to owning what money can't buy. About the visit, she recounts, &quot;I've had a sincere desire to be in Haiti ever since I started reading Edwidge Danticat, but never did visit before the storm. It was a life-changing experience which I'll always remember, and the songs I performed there will now always have that flavor of pure music and joy in my memory.&quot; Other current collaborators include Jonatha Brooke, David Batteau, Andy Rosen, and Jenny Scheinman. The new album is due to be released June 14th, 2011, and Peyroux plans to begin touring again in the US and Europe in early spring. &quot;I think my fans are eager to hear something different,&quot; Peyroux says, and pauses with restraint before adding, &quot;Music has grown into another place in my mind... I am the same singer that I was as a teen, that wants to grow into music, wherever it comes from. I don't believe I've given up anything. I've added to myself.&quot; Let's hope that that little air of restraint doesn't hold her back. \n\nThis is a wonderful CD release by the jazz musician/composer Madeleine Peyroux, titled 'Standing On The Rooftop'. In this new CD (12 tracks) Madeleine Peyroux collaborates/song co-writing with Rolling Stones' Bill Wyman. The result is great jazz music, hopefully to make her prominent as if standing onto the rooftop. She has tour dates lined up for US &amp; Europe to support this CD release. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include &quot;I Threw It All Away&quot; (wonderful guitar solo &amp; melody), &quot;Don't Pick A Fight With A Poet&quot; &amp; &quot;Ophelia&quot; (a slow track with a beautiful piano/guitar combination &amp; melody). Great tracks include &quot;Martha, My Dear&quot; (great guitar/banjo combination &amp; vocals), &quot;The Kind You Can't Afford&quot; (great guitar &amp; vocals), &quot;Fickle Dove&quot; (great piano &amp; vocals), &quot;Lay You Sleeping Head, My Love&quot; (a slow track with great melody, vocals &amp; guitar), &quot;Standing On The Rooftop&quot; ('rough' guitar sound. This is the title track for this CD), &quot;Love In Vain&quot; (great violin/orchestral sound &amp; vocals), &quot;Meet Me In Rio&quot; (great guitar solo &amp; vocals) &amp; &quot;The Way Of All Things&quot; (great harmonies, bass, melody &amp; vocals). Okay track is &quot;The Things I've Seen Today&quot;. On overall, this is a wonderful CD release (with collaboration with rocker Bill Wyman) by Madeleine Peyroux, a highly recommended CD listening. ~ M. Mariba &quot;the teacher&quot; \n\nSimply put, this is her best since &quot;Careless Love.&quot; \nShe makes the three covers (McCartney's &quot;Martha, My Dear,&quot; Dylan's &quot;I Threw It All Away&quot; and Robert Johnson's &quot;Love In Vain&quot;) her own, and her own originals are great. \nInstrumentally, this is an earthier, rootsier (is that a word?) CD than her previous CDs. \nThere's a couple of times when I flash on Bonnie Raitt's music, circa &quot;Nick Of Time,&quot; but I can't exactly say why. \nHer vocals are as good -if not better- than anything she's done previously. \nThe whole thing is brimming with realized talent and self-confidence. ~ Jon Strand\n\nMadeleine Peyroux - Standing on the Rooftop Tracks;\n01  Martha, My Dear 2:32    \n02  The Kind You Can't Afford 3:59    \n03  The Things I've Seen Today 3:44    \n04  Fickle Dove 3:27    \n05  Lay Your Sleeping Head, My Love 3:22    \n06  Standing On The Rooftop 5:46    \n07  I Threw It All Away 3:13    \n08  Love In Vain 3:38    \n09  Don't Pick A Fight With A Poet 4:28    \n10  Meet Me In Rio 3:51    \n11  Ophelia 5:12    \n12  The Way Of All Things 4:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c60cebabe35214ed59871c5c884473bfa1ba1a9f","amp;dn":"Madeleine+Peyroux+-+Standing+on+the+Rooftop+%282011%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c60cebabe35214ed59871c5c884473bfa1ba1a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,12,235,171,227,82,20,237,89,135,28,92,136,68,115,191,161,186,26,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
