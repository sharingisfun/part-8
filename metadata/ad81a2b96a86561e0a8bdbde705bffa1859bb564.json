In todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s climate, that seems as miraculous and unfathomable as a \nseeing someone walking a brachiosaurus.\n__________\n\n01 - Chasing Pirates\n\n02 - Even Though\n\n03 - Light As A Feather\n\n04 - Young Blood\n\n05 - I Wouldn't Need You\n\n06 - Waiting\n\n07 - It's Gonna Be\n\n08 - You've Ruined Me\n\n09 - Back To Manhattan\n\n10 - Stuck\n\n11 - December\n\n12 - Tell Yer Mama\n\n13 - Man Of The Hour\n\nBrazilian Deluxe Edition/Target / iTunes Deluxe Version Bonus Tracks -\n\nLive at the Living Room\n\n01 - It's Gonna Be\n\n02 - Waiting\n\n03 - You've Ruined Me\n\n04 - Jesus Etc.\n\n05 - Cry, Cry, Cry\n\n06 - Strangers\n__________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 6.14 MiB\nDuration                         : 2mn 40s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : The Fall\nTrack name                       : Chasing Pirates\nTrack name/Position              : 01\nPerformer                        : Norah Jones\nAccompaniment                    : Norah Jones\nGenre                            : Jazz\nRecorded date                    : 2009\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 2mn 40s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 6.14 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n__________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 7.74 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 22s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : The Fall - Bonus-CD- Live At The Living Room\nTrack name                       : It's Gonna Be\nTrack name/Position              : 01\nPerformer                        : Norah Jones\nAccompaniment                    : Norah Jones\nGenre                            : Jazz\nRecorded date                    : 2009\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 3mn 22s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 7.74 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad81a2b96a86561e0a8bdbde705bffa1859bb564","amp;dn":"Norah+Jones+The+Fall+%28Deluxe+live+bonus+tracks%29%28mp3+320kbs%29ICM36","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad81a2b96a86561e0a8bdbde705bffa1859bb564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,129,162,185,106,134,86,30,10,139,219,222,112,91,255,161,133,155,181,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
