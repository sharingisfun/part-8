It is the seventh Australian and sixth internationally released studio album by the band.\n\nReleased on 21 July 1980, Back in Black was the first AC/DC album recorded without former lead singer Bon Scott, who died on 19 February at the age of 33, and was dedicated to him. The band considered disbanding following his death, but they ultimately decided to continue, with encouragement from Scott's parents, and shortly thereafter hired Brian Johnson as their new lead singer and lyricist. \n\nProducer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who had previously worked with AC/DC on Highway to Hell, was again brought in to produce. The album was recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, and Electric Lady Studios in New York, where the album was also mixed.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Hells Bells&quot;   \t               5:10\n2. \t&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;   \t               5:17\n3. \t&quot;What Do You Do for Money Honey&quot;       3:33\n4. \t&quot;Given the Dog a Bone&quot;   \t       3:30\n5. \t&quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot;          4:16\n6. \t&quot;Back in Black&quot;   \t               4:14\n7. \t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;          3:30\n8. \t&quot;Have a Drink on Me&quot;   \t               3:57\n9. \t&quot;Shake a Leg&quot;   \t               4:06\n10. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot;  4:15\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c46be8b60417dc843f80109503053d53a9b6e5e8","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1980+-+Back+In+Black+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c46be8b60417dc843f80109503053d53a9b6e5e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,107,232,182,4,23,220,132,63,128,16,149,3,5,61,83,169,182,229,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
