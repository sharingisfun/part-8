After waking up in the middle of the night to mysterious sounds, you start a journey in the dark looking for your mother.\n\nThe game lets you experience the horror felt by a child when familiar and friendly surroundings are transformed into something sinister. While wandering around in surrealistic environments, you have only your teddy bear as a companion. There might be threats hiding in every shadow, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no traditional combat. Instead, you will actively have to find places to hide and avoid confrontation in order to survive. In Among the Sleep youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re vulnerable, scared, and trying to make sense of the world. Dark things will happen. How will you find comfort?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af7efdc07b61cf0a60ea7466b19ce8748e8020b","amp;dn":"Among+The+Sleep+%28Latest+with+1.1+Patch%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af7efdc07b61cf0a60ea7466b19ce8748e8020b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,247,239,220,7,182,28,240,166,14,167,70,107,25,206,135,72,232,2,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
