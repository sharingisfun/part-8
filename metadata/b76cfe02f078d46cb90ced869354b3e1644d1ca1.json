I recently purchased the DVD which was released in 2002. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a classic film with an outstanding cast and is impressively, musically scored as well! Rudolph Martin is amazing as Vlad Dracula. The movie depicts several, true historic happens such as:\n-A young Vlad Dracula and his brother; Radu the Handsome, being held captive for years by the Turkish Sultan \n-Vlad Dracula choosing common people as his allies instead of members of high society\n-Dracula, inviting members of the Romanian Noble Class to a State dinner then having them executed.\n-The story of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGolden CupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n-Nailing the turbans to the heads of the Turkish Muslims for their refusal to remove them in DraculaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s presence\n-VladÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother Radu choosing to live with and adopt the Muslim culture \n-Vlad DraculaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guerrilla warfare and military scare tactics\n-VladÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disregard for the church in order to better his army and stabilize his country\n-Vlad Dracula feasting among the bodies of the nobles he had killed\n\nThe movie also demystifies the folklore surrounding Vlad III, while still giving the viewer the choice to make up their own minds about the true person that he was.\nThree years ago I spent the better part of a year researching Vlad III, Voivode of Wallachia, as he was an amazing historical figure far beyond merely being inspiration for vampire pop culture. And from all I have read, I always thought that this film truly displayed Vlad III/ Vlad Tepes/Vlad Dracula most accurately. I was happy to read a note of this from Wikipedia:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDark Prince: The True Story of Dracula, a film released in 2000, tells the life story of Vlad the Impaler mostly accurately.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler#Film_and_book_adaptations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_III_the_Impaler#Film_and_book_adaptations&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA classic picture to enjoy for Halloween! Please SEED! Cheers.\n\nPLOT: Dracula: The Dark Prince 2000 (alternately titled Dark Prince: The True Story Of Dracula and Dark Prince: Legend of Dracula) is a horror-war television film, which premiered in the United States on the USA Network on Halloween, October 31, 2000. It is about Vlad III Dracula, &quot;the Impaler&quot;, the historical figure who gave Bram Stoker's Dracula his name.\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD: \nMeet the man behind the legend in this true story of Vlad the Impaler, whose vicious and cruel reputation as a bloodthirsty warlord became the basis for the myth of Dracula. When young Vlad Dracula, the Prince Romania, and his younger brother Radu are kidnapped and held hostage by the Turkish Sultan Mohammed, their father is murdered and the Sultan holds the boys prisoner for many years. When the grown Vlad is finally released, he vows to avenge his father's death and to return to liberate his brother from the Sultan. As Vlad wages a bloody war both within his country and against the Turks, he finds enemies at every turn, but when he is betrayed by his closest confidants, he wages is life, and soul, for vengeance.\n\nFACTS: \n-Shot on location in Romania with a largely Romanian crew. \n-DraculaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s castle in the film is actually Poenari Castle. While in truth, Vlad III had no, singe abode he saw an importance for Poenari Castle when he was Prince. It was then in ruin so Vlad Dracula had it partially renovated and restored during his reign as Voivode of Wallachia. \n\nCAST &amp; CHARACTERS: \nVlad Dracula the Impaler: Rudolf Martin\nLidia: Jane March\nBruno: Christopher Brand\nFather Stefan: Peter Weller\nKing Janos: Roger Daltrey\nRadu: Michael Sutton\nDETAILS:\nImbd: tt0240793\nRated: R (Restricted)\nLanguage: English\nStudio: Live / Artisan\nDVD Release Date: April 23, 2002\nRun Time: 92 minutes\n\nMEMORABLE QUOTES:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe once told me greed was a stronger force then any army.
