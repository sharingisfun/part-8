JHB's brand of roadhouse rock can be somewhat bland on disc; here the group captures much more of its trademark live intensity than in the past. The unobtrusive addition of keyboards adds a more expansive dimension to several tracks. Boogie fans will want to check out the ZZ Top-like &quot;Cruel Little Number&quot;; blues-rockers will come away satisfied with the likes of &quot;House That Love Built.&quot; Hip-hop connoisseurs, on the other hand, will likely want to avoid JHB's rap spoof on &quot;If You Can't Feel Anything Else.&quot;.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Cruel Little Number\n[02] Leave The Light On\n[03] Baby's Lookin' Hot\n[04] Lost In Your Eyes\n[05] House That Love Built\n[06] Evil And Here To Stay\n[07] My Kinda Lover\n[08] It Could All Get Blown Away\n[09] You're Coming Home\n[10] If You Can't Fell Anything Else\n[11] Heart Of An Angel\n[12] Live And Love\n[13] Joined At The Heart\n[14] Dreams Of Love\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:08m:00s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 162mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
