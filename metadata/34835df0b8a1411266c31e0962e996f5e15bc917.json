The melody of &quot;New City&quot; has attractive, expansive intervals, and &quot;From the Prison&quot; is an intense piece of balladry built around a riff on the guitar's bass strings. Finally, the title track is seven-and-a-half minutes of sitar, flute, tamboura, and tabla, very much of its time, when George Harrison's interest in Ravi Shankar led many musicians to experiment with Indian instruments, rhythms, and melodies. This cut could be the soundtrack to a flower-power dance in the park or an incense-laced gathering around a hookah beneath posters and black lights.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34835df0b8a1411266c31e0962e996f5e15bc917","amp;dn":"Richie+Havens+-+Somethin%27+Else+Again+%5B1968%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34835df0b8a1411266c31e0962e996f5e15bc917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,131,93,240,184,161,65,18,102,195,30,9,98,233,150,245,225,91,201,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
