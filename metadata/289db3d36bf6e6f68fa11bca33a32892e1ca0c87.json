Vertebrates features a unique emphasis on function and evolution of vertebrates, complete anatomical detail, and excellent pedagogy. Vertebrate groups are organized phylogenetically, and their systems discussed within such a context. Morphology is foremost, but the author has developed and integrated an understanding of function and evolution into the discussion of anatomy of the various systems.\n\nAbout the Author\nKen Kardong is a professor in the zoology department at Washington State University, Pullman, WA. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois and his MS and BA from the University of Washington. In addition to teaching comparative anatomy and evolution, Ken is also involved in developing software programs for use in the laboratory sections of these courses. \n\nBrief Contents\nCHAPTER one INTRODUCTION 1\nCHAPTER two ORIGIN OF CHORDATES 48\nCHAPTER three THE VERTEBRATE STORY 82\nCHAPTER four BIOLOGICAL DESIGN 128\nCHAPTER five LIFE HISTORY 161\nCHAPTER six INTEGUMENT 212\nCHAPTER seven SKELETAL SYSTEM: THE SKULL 240\nCHAPTER eight SKELETAL SYSTEM: THE AXIAL SKELETON 294\nCHAPTER nine SKELETAL SYSTEM: THE APPENDICULAR SKELETON 325\nCHAPTER ten THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM 372\nCHAPTER eleven THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 413\nCHAPTER twelve THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 451\nCHAPTER thirteen THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM 503\nCHAPTER fourteen THE UROGENITAL SYSTEM 545\nCHAPTER fifteen THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM 592\nCHAPTER sixteen THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 625\nCHAPTER seventeen SENSORY ORGANS 671\nCHAPTER eighteen CONCLUSIONS 714","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:289db3d36bf6e6f68fa11bca33a32892e1ca0c87","amp;dn":"Vertebrates+-+Comparative+Anatomy%2C+Function%2C+Evolution+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"289db3d36bf6e6f68fa11bca33a32892e1ca0c87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,157,179,211,107,246,230,246,143,161,27,202,51,163,40,146,225,202,12,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
