And what does he have to do with the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nOn paper, MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking too good these days, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.\n\nWhat was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceÃ¢â‚¬â€especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. And the Racketeer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born yesterday . . .\n\nNothing is as it seems and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller.\n Show Less","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7a3ba213c292e3008d33963bd17701aeb1e883","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+The+Racketeer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7a3ba213c292e3008d33963bd17701aeb1e883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,122,59,162,19,194,146,227,0,141,51,150,59,209,119,1,174,177,232,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
