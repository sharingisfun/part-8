DEA agent Art Keller has been fighting the war on drugs for thirty years in a blood feud against AdÃ¡n Barrera, the head of El FederaciÃ³n, the worldâ€™s most powerful cartel, and the man who brutally murdered Kellerâ€™s partner. Finally putting Barrera away cost Keller dearlyâ€”the woman he loves, the beliefs he cherishes, the life he wants to lead.\r\n\r\nThen Barrera gets out, determined to rebuild the empire that Keller shattered. Unwilling to live in a world with Barrera in it, Keller goes on a ten-year odyssey to take him down. His obsession with justiceâ€”or is it revenge?â€”becomes a ruthless struggle that stretches from the cities, mountains, and deserts of Mexico to Washingtonâ€™s corridors of power to the streets of Berlin and Barcelona","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eb0ca91c6740f39ebf2b8bb6eb525ed2dee128f","amp;dn":"Don+Winslow-The+Cartel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eb0ca91c6740f39ebf2b8bb6eb525ed2dee128f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,176,202,145,198,116,15,57,235,242,184,187,110,181,37,237,45,238,18,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
