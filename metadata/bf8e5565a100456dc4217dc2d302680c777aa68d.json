Truth is determined by how fervently they believe it\n\nWith his trademark wit and insight, veteran journalist Charles Pierce delivers a gut-wrenching, side-splitting lament about the glorification of ignorance in the United States.\n\nPierce asks how a country founded on intellectual curiosity has somehow deteriorated into a nation of simpletons more apt to vote for an American Idol contestant than a presidential candidate. But his thunderous denunciation is also a secret call to action, as he hopes that somehow, being intelligent will stop being a stigma, and that pinheads will once again be pitied, not celebrated. Erudite and razor-sharp, Idiot America is at once an invigorating history lesson, a cutting cultural critique, and a bullish appeal to our smarter selves.\nGenre: Non-fiction , Political Science\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8e5565a100456dc4217dc2d302680c777aa68d","amp;dn":"idiot_america__how_stupidity_became_a_virtue_in_the_land_of_the_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8e5565a100456dc4217dc2d302680c777aa68d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,142,85,101,161,0,69,109,196,33,125,194,211,2,104,12,119,122,166,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
