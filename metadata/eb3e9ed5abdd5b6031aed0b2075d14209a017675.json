At the age of nineteen, working as a cocktail waitress in Calgary, Alberta, she began saving her tips so she could travel the globe. Aspiring to understand the world and live a significant life, she backpacked through Latin America, Laos, Bangladesh, and India, and emboldened by each adventure, went on to Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan. In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a television reporter. And then, in August 2008, she traveled to SomaliaÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most dangerous place on earth.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On her fourth day, she was abducted by a group of masked men along a dusty road.\n\nHeld hostage for 460 days, Amanda converts to Islam as a survival tactic, receives Ã¢â‚¬Å“wife lessonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from one of her captors, and risks a daring escape. Moved between a series of abandoned houses in the desert, she survives on memoryÃ¢â‚¬â€every lush detail of the world she experienced in her life before captivityÃ¢â‚¬â€and on strategy, fortitude, and hope. When she is most desperate, she visits a house in the sky, high above the woman kept in chains, in the dark, being tortured.\n\nVivid and suspenseful, as artfully written as the finest novel, A House in the Sky is the searingly intimate story of an intrepid young woman and her search for compassion in the face of unimaginable adversity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb3e9ed5abdd5b6031aed0b2075d14209a017675","amp;dn":"A+House+in+The+Sky+-+Amanda+Lindhout+%26amp%3B+Sara+Corbett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb3e9ed5abdd5b6031aed0b2075d14209a017675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,62,158,213,171,221,91,96,49,174,208,178,7,93,20,32,154,1,118,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
