Based on past experience and this first wave of thusly-tagged rips, anything below 400 dpi (2,560 pixels wide, at standard aspect ratio) is to be considered &quot;ordinary&quot; and anything above 450 dpi (~3k pixels wide at standard AR) &quot;ultra&quot;.\n\nTo illustrate what the releases are actually like, I'm replacing the usual cover image by an interior sample here - a scaled-down page on the left, and a full-size detail from the centre of that page on the right, with the green frame pointing out the corresponding portions.\n\nEnjoy! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a51b26928c7a400f50b171c3942a9bccdf3b683","amp;dn":"%5BuHD%5D+Rat+Queens+Special%3A+Braga+%28Image%7C2015%7CDigital%27%27450%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a51b26928c7a400f50b171c3942a9bccdf3b683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,81,178,105,40,199,164,0,245,11,23,28,57,66,169,188,205,243,182,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
