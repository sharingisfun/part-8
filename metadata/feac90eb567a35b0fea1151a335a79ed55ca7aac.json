Originally credited to the Prestige All Stars, it was only credited to Coltrane on its re-release in 1963, when the saxophonist's star was firmly in the ascendant.\n \nHe gets no more solo time than either of the other saxophonists, baritone players Cecil Payne and Pepper Adams. Coltrane, his tenor already possessing the incisive sound which took wings on Giant Steps, works like spice amongst Payne's lighter, at times Lester Young-ish tone, and Adams' tougher, more abrasive one (not for nothing was Adams nicknamed The Knife). The differences in their respective presentations offer a contrast that complements the cool refinement of Adams and Pepper when juxtaposed with Coltrane's frenetic flurries. \n\nThere's a fierce, devil may care atmosphere, rolling around in the sound of the instruments, which establishes a mood sustained throughout the album.\nDakar is a characterful set of propulsive, pre-codification hard bop and still a delight over half a century later.\n\n\nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feac90eb567a35b0fea1151a335a79ed55ca7aac","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Dakar+1957+%2F+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feac90eb567a35b0fea1151a335a79ed55ca7aac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,172,144,235,86,122,53,176,254,161,21,26,51,90,121,237,85,202,122,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
