Diamond\n\n[b]Produced by[/b] Alain Bernheim, Charles Matthau, Jay Weston\n\n[b]Format:[/b] Color, NTSC\n\n[b]Rated[/b] R (Restricted) \n\n\n\nReview from imdb:\n\nFor what turned out to be his final film, Billy Wilder decided to adapt the French black comedy L'Emmerdeur to America and he and his writing partner I.A.L. Diamond came up with Buddy Buddy. \n\nAs it turned out I saw this film back to back with Wilder's Kiss Me Stupid. In that one, a whole lot of talented actors couldn't raise it above mediocrity. But in watching Buddy Buddy I failed to see why this one was slammed as bad as it was. It's not anything close to what Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau did in The Fortune Cookie or even in the remake of The Front Page. Still Buddy Buddy does have its moments.\n\nOf course the film does hinge on the incomparable chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau and they save the film essentially for Wilder. They are two total strangers whom chance throws together at a most inopportune moment.\n\nMatthau is a professional hit-man who's been given the job of killing three stoolies who are to testify at a mob trial. He's got the first two and has a plan set for number three.\n\nThen of course he meets Lemmon who is despondent over his wife leaving him for a fake sex therapist. He checks into the same hotel in the room next to Matthau who is readying his hit and tries to commit suicide. \n\nFor the rest of the film Matthau is forced to take an interest in this schnook's marital problems to keep from committing suicide and bringing a swarm of police to the hotel. Matthau and Lemmon get into some pretty funny situation as there seems to be no end in sight to what can go wrong with a well thought out plan. \n\nLemmon's wife is played by Paula Prentiss and their marriage seems very much modeled on the one Lemmon had in The Fortune Cookie. Things work out just about the same way for the unhappy couple.\n\nThings kind of work out for Matthau too in a rather unbelievable way for which you will have to see Buddy Buddy. And while it's not like some of the great Wilder classics of the Fifties when Billy was at his creative best, it's far from the worst film he could have gone out on.\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082111/[/url]\n\n\n\n[b]AVI, 692 MiB, 1h 31mn\nDivX 5, 986 Kbps, 384 x 288, 4/3, 25 fps, Progressive\nMPEG-1 Audio layer 3, 48 KHz[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d78218a9d465ec7698e2df5851c7f4188d2a69d","amp;dn":"Buddy+Buddy+%281981%2C+w+Walter+Matthau%2C+Jack+Lemmon%2C+dir+Billy+Wild","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d78218a9d465ec7698e2df5851c7f4188d2a69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,120,33,138,157,70,94,199,105,142,45,245,133,28,127,65,136,210,166,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
