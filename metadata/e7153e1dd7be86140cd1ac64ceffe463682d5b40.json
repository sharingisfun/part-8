The Next Step\n\n\nReview From AMG:\nGuitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel&amp;#039;s Deep Song is an intimately atmospheric album that finds the ever-reaching jazz musician in the company of a stellar ensemble. Rosenwinkel has always displayed the strong influences of such expansive players as Pat Metheny, John Scofield, and Pat Martino, and tracks such as the continually overlapping &quot;The Cloister&quot; do nothing if not reinforce such high comparative praise. In fact, Rosenwinkel&amp;#039;s moody take on &quot;If I Should Lose You&quot; brings to mind such cerebrally mellow Martino classics as We&amp;#039;ll Be Together Again and Cream. Joining him here are the deep-color talents of saxophonist Joshua Redman, pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Larry Grenadier, and drummers Jeff Ballard and Ali Jackson.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7153e1dd7be86140cd1ac64ceffe463682d5b40","amp;dn":"Kurt+Rosenwinkel+-+Deep+Song%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7153e1dd7be86140cd1ac64ceffe463682d5b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,21,62,29,215,190,134,20,12,209,172,100,206,255,228,99,104,45,91,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
