It follows the success of her EP, Slow.\n\nMusically, Seasons Of My Soul is influenced by RumerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s upbringing, which takes in a childhood spent in an enclosed, exotic expat colony in Pakistan. Here, her family would often sing and write songs together, determined to provide their own entertainment in the absence of TV or newspapers. Then, they relocated to the New Forest, where Rumer first saw a television, and married her love of the folk tradition with the sweeping melodies of the technicolor movie musicals. It is a blissful harmony, which you can hear in the likes of Slow and Come To Me High.\n\nLabel: Atlantic\nGenre: Pop\nQuality: VBR kbps\nSize: 46MB\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n1. Am I Forgiven?\n2.
