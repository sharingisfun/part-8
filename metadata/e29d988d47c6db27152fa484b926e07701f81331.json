There are a few things that you have to be aware of when fiddling around with vMac disk images.\n\nthe PPC application starts up in fullscreen mode by default.\nthe UB app runs in window mode but you can switch to fullscreen at any time by pressing ctrl-f.\n\nhave fun with this retro pack and please seed when you&amp;#039;re done ;)\n\nPreview: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haLmgAaBg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haLmgAaBg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/halMHaABg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/halMHaABg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNOTE: If you are low on system memory, which can happen pretty easily because the emulated RAM limit is only 4MB, do the following to increase the size of available system RAM:\n\nGo to the Apple-Menu -&gt; select Control Panels -&gt; then select &quot;Extensions Manager&quot;.\nYou will then see a list of all installed extensions - the ones that are checked are active - the other ones are not.\nat the top of the window there is a preset option.\nClick on it and select &quot;save set&quot; - choose a name and then click on OK.\nNow select the preset that is labeled &quot;System 7.5.3&quot;.\nThis will deactivate all installed extensions that are not OS 7.5 default.\nClose the extensions manager and shut down vMac.\nThe next time you boot up you will have an additional 800K of system memory available.\nIn order to return to your previous extensions configuration, just select the set you have saved before and restart.\n\nAnother way to get memory hungry apps to run on vMac is to decrease the minimum RAM size that is allocated to the application.\nTo do so click on the application and select &quot;Get Info&quot; from the file menu.\nUnder &quot;Memory requirements&quot; enter a new (lower) value for the minimum and preferred RAM size.\nHowever this not recommended because it may cause the app to crash or become unstable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29d988d47c6db27152fa484b926e07701f81331","amp;dn":"Mini+vMac+Emulation+Pack+%28Over+400+Classic+B%26W+Games%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29d988d47c6db27152fa484b926e07701f81331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,157,152,141,71,198,219,39,21,47,164,132,185,38,224,119,1,248,19,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
