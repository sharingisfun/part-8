Brooks , Matt Groening\n\nStoryline\nHomer adopts a pig who's run away from Krusty Burger after Krusty tried to have him slaughtered, naming the pig &quot;Spider Pig.&quot; At the same time, the lake is protected after the audience sink the barge Green Day are on with garbage after they mention the environment. Meanwhile, Spider Pig's waste has filled up a silo in just 2 days, apparently with Homer's help. Homer can't get to the dump quickly so dumps the silo in the lake, polluting it. Russ Cargill, the villainous boss of the EPA, gives Arnold Schwarzenegger 5 options, forcing him to choose 4 (which is, unfortunately, to destroy Springfield) and putting a dome over Springfield to prevent evacuation. Homer, however, has escaped, along with his family. Can he stop the evil Cargill from annihilating his home town, and his family, who have been forced to return to Springfield?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAJkGaAEb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAJkGaAEb&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : AVI at 2487 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 23mn 12s 840ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 2097 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 304 (2.368) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 384 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32ac1687a9401086b4e489d2b83051556646938","amp;dn":"The+Simpsons+Movie+2007+Greek+audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32ac1687a9401086b4e489d2b83051556646938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,42,193,104,122,148,1,8,107,78,72,157,43,131,5,21,86,100,105,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
