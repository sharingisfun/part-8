With the added influences of Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, along with his own touch of aggressive metal that overwhelmed his home country of Sweden, Wrong Again Records took notice and released In Flames' 1993 debut, Lunar Strain. In the tradition of many other Swedish metal acts, In Flames also had a revolving lineup that changed year after year -- not that this was going to stop them from releasing their next album, Subterranean (1994), before signing to Nuclear Blast Records in 1996.\n\n  After putting out The Jester Race album later that year, followed by 1997's Whoracle, In Flames' lineup was finally settled with BjÃƒÂ¶rn Gelotte (drums), Anders FridÃƒÂ©n (vocals), Peter Iwers (bass), and Daniel Svensson (drums) in addition to StrÃƒÂ¶mblad. To celebrate, the band released its sixth album, Colony, in 1999. Clayman followed in the same vein the next year, and the band even managed to keep the same lineup for this release. The live Tokyo Showdown was released to promote their tour in 2001. Reroute to Remain arrived in 2002, followed by Soundtrack to Your Escape in 2004 and Come Clarity in 2006. In 2008 the band released its ninth studio album, A Sense of Purpose, which featured the single &quot;Mirror's Truth,&quot; followed in 2011 by Sounds of a Playground Fading, which was the first release not to include founding guitarist StrÃƒÂ¶mblad, who left the band the previous year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:968dbd9f3b57ce1e0bf2b0ce508ba81c5f5738a1","amp;dn":"In+Flames+-+Siren+Charms+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"968dbd9f3b57ce1e0bf2b0ce508ba81c5f5738a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,141,189,159,59,87,206,30,11,242,176,206,80,139,168,28,95,87,56,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
