More of a solo project than a group effort -- Lou Barlow was out and then some, Murph only drums on three tracks, a few guests pop up here and there -- it\\&amp;#039;s still a great album, recorded and performed with gusto. Such a judgment may seem strange given Mascis\\&amp;#039; legendary image as the ÃƒÂ¼berslacker, but clearly the man knows how to balance how to convey himself with getting the job done. \\&quot;The Wagon\\&quot; itself kicks off the album, an even quicker and nuttier sequel to the peerless \\&quot;Freak Scene\\&quot; -- Don Fleming of Gumball fame adds some of the music and background vocals, but otherwise it\\&amp;#039;s Mascis and Murph cranking it and having a blast. When Mascis goes into one of his patented over-the-top solos, it all feels just right -- this is loud rock music for putting a smile on your face, not beating up people in a pit. The remainder of the album floats and rumbles along in its uniquely Dinosaur Jr. type of way, as apt to find poppy hooks, singalongs, and soft strumming as it is to blow out the Marshalls. Sublime moments include the contrast of sweet acoustic guitar and loud drums on \\&quot;Blowing It,\\&quot; the fun thrash of \\&quot;How\\&amp;#039;d You Pin That One on Me,\\&quot; and the Mellotron-as-flute-tinged stomp \\&quot;Thumb.\\&quot; If nothing on the album is completely as freaked-out and over the top as \\&quot;Push\\&quot; from Bug, it\\&amp;#039;s still a fine translation of Mascis\\&amp;#039; art for the commercial big boys. The song titles alone sometime say it all -- \\&quot;Puke + Cry,\\&quot; \\&quot;I Live for That Look,\\&quot; \\&quot;Muck.\\&quot; Mascis throughout sounds like his usual self, cracked drawl ever as it was and shall be.\\&quot; -AMG\n\nGood music never gets old!\n//TheDuck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:853f860665e827751eb7598bfd4337ace0a5aef6","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+Dinosaur+JR+-+Green+Mind+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"853f860665e827751eb7598bfd4337ace0a5aef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,63,134,6,101,232,39,117,30,183,89,139,253,67,55,172,224,165,174,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
