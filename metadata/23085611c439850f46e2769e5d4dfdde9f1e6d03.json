Writer/director/star Sylvester Stallone affords Conti a wider emotional berth this time around, allowing for poignant, melancholy themes like &quot;Vigil&quot; alongside fist-pumping anthems like the climactic &quot;Overture&quot; -- as before, Conti employs little more than solo piano, a small string ensemble, and a potent brass section, and it&amp;#039;s to the composer&amp;#039;s enormous credit that he can forge such larger-than-life music from relatively few instrumental elements. &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; even reappears, this time with a children&amp;#039;s choir in tow, and sounds better than ever. Not even Frank Stallone&amp;#039;s &quot;Two Kinds of Love&quot; can torpedo this one.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Redemption [Theme from Rocky II] - Bill Conti  [2:34]\n02 - Gonna Fly Now - Bill Conti  [2:35]\n03 - Conquest - Bill Conti  [4:43]\n04 - Vigil - Bill Conti  [6:32]\n05 - All of My Life - Bill Conti, DeEtta Little, Nelson Pigford  [4:00]\n06 - Overture - Bill Conti  [8:38]\n07 - Two Kinds of Love - Bill Conti  [2:37]\n08 - All of My Life [Instrumental] - Bill Conti, Mike Lang  [2:27]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23085611c439850f46e2769e5d4dfdde9f1e6d03","amp;dn":"Rocky+II+-+Soundtrack+%281979%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23085611c439850f46e2769e5d4dfdde9f1e6d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,8,86,17,196,57,133,15,70,226,118,158,93,77,253,222,159,30,109,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
