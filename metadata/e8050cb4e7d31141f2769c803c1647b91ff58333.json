Virtually nothing is known of these beings except that they savor the carnage and clamor of battle. As such, they have stocked the arena with the greatest warriors of all time. And you have just joined their ranks.\nAs a gladiator in the Arena Eternal, you must not only survive, but also win each and every battle against ever more powerful opponents. Don't worry overly much about getting &quot;fragged.&quot; The Vadrigar won't be cheated of their favorite sport by a little thing like death. Those who fall are instantly restored to life and immediately thrust back into the battle, perhaps a little wiser for their misfortunes.\n\nWhen the dust, blood, and gibs settle, all warriors will have earned the right to battle again, providing further entertainment for the Vadrigar. But only the warrior who has fragged the most foes will be lauded as the winner. The victorious gladiator advances to a more challenging array of arenas, until, at last, he or she faces Xaero, Lord of the Final Arena.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n    * 3-D Hardware Accelerator with full OpenGLÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® support\n    * PentiumÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 233 Mhz MMXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®processor with 8 MB Video Card\n      Or Pentium II 266 Mhz processor with 4 MB Video Card\n      Or AMDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 350 Mhz K6Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-2 processor with 4 MB Video Card\n    * 64 MB RAM\n    * A 100% WindowsÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 95/98/NT 4.0 compatible computer system (including compatible 32-bit drivers for CD-ROM drive , video card, sound card and input devices)\n    * Windows 95/98/ NT 4.0 (with Service Pack 3) operating system\n    * 25 MB of uncompressed hard disk space for game files (Minimum Install), plus 45 MB for the Windows swap file\n    * Quad-speed CD-ROM drive (600 K/sec. sustained transfer rate)\n    * 100% DirectX 3.0 or higher compatible sound card\n    * 100% Microsof-compatible mouse and driver\n    * 100%Windows 95/98/NT 4.0 compatible joystick (optional)\n\nMultiplayer Requirements:\n\n    * Internet (TCP/IP) and LAN (TCP/IP and IPX) play supported\n    * Internet play requires a 100% Windows 95/98/NT 4.0-compatible 28.8 Kbps (or faster) modem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese disc images come in ISO (disc image) format, and will needed to either be mounted to the system by using software such as Magic Disc (located inside torrent) or burn it directly to a CD using an image burning program.
