In Blueberry Hill, the combination of sunny characters and spirited sensuality is absolutely irresistible. A Baltimore district attorney, Jocelyn Fletcher has put her high pressure career on hold to reevaluate her life. While visiting her sisters in picturesque Misty Harbor, Maine, she takes a temporary job as a widower's live-in nanny. Jocelyn's warm humor quickly earns the affection of her three young charges. More slowly, her blonde beauty and rosy smile begin to rouse the desires of their very handsome father, county sheriff Quinn Larson. The small New England coastal village provides the perfect backdrop for a romance that soon captures everyone's attention. Narrator Johanna Parker voices each nuance of the playful banter between Jocelyn and Quinn as they open their hearts to each other","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be1b4c9a53249f6a7e40029a6e53bf222b19d0b1","amp;dn":"Marcia+Evanick-Blueberry+Hill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be1b4c9a53249f6a7e40029a6e53bf222b19d0b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,27,76,154,83,36,159,106,126,64,2,154,110,83,191,34,43,25,208,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
