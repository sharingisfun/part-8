(Fraunhofer CBR 32 kbit/s 22050 Hz Mono, jetAudio 6.2 plus).\n\n\nThis is the start of my complete collection of Enid Blyton\\'s 21 Famous Five books. These are Chivers unabridged readings mostly by Jan Francis. These are not dramatizations or abridged versions!\n\nThese audio books were a big job and took me over six months to find and transcribe from tape. In many cases I could only locate one unabridged copy of the book! The quality is fair to good considering the age of some of the tapes.\nThe only problem is with the very first book (Five on a Treasure Island). Part 5 is missing 7 minutes and part 6 is missing 8 minutes due to garbled speech.\nI have not been able to locate another copy, and include it here for completeness. I have listened to it and although it\\'s missing about 15 minutes the story is still understandable.\n\n(If anyone finds an unabridged copy of this in good condition, please upload it).\n6th December 2008 UPDATE: - I have now located a complete copy of the first book.
