Among its fans are author Max Brooks. Because of the popularity of the series, which increased considerably when it was adapted into a television series of the same name, artist Tony Moore's original artwork for the series' early issues has gone up in value. On the March 28, 2013 episode of the VH1 reality television series For What It's Worth, Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of issue #1 was professionally appraised to be worth $20,000.\n\nIGN ranked The Governor as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time in 2009, describing him as &quot;a sadistic evil that 'The Road Warrior' forgot.&quot; In 2011, Wizard magazine ranked The Governor as the 131st greatest comic book character of all time, and IGN ranked Michonne as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time and main protagonist Rick Grimes as the 26th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time, stating that Kirkman &quot;has an endless supply of [wringers] to run Rick through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f36654cbf6582696fb1a681f3e09e56724e5262","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Vol.+18+What+Comes+After","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f36654cbf6582696fb1a681f3e09e56724e5262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,54,101,76,191,101,130,105,111,177,166,129,243,224,158,86,114,78,82,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
