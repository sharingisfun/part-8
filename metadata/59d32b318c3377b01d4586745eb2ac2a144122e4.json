He's been lucky so far. He gained passage on a ship and is quietly learning the strategies of war and conquest from the hardy crew. Now, with a prisoner in tow--the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat--Halfdan is finally starting to earn some respect, and a name for himself.\n\nBut he is not looking for praise. Halfdan is only biding his time, gaining strength and skill for his ultimate quest. Time and again he proves himself on the battlefield, using clever strategy and an uncanny talent with a bow and arrow. Halfdan is growing as a warrior, but will this be enough to beat a savage murderer?\n\nThrough epic battle scenes and intimate power struggles, Judson Roberts brings the Viking world to pulsing life in this next chapter of the Strongbow Saga.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d32b318c3377b01d4586745eb2ac2a144122e4","amp;dn":"The+Road+to+Vengeance+-+%5BThe+Strongbow+Saga%2C+%233%5D+-+Judson+Robert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d32b318c3377b01d4586745eb2ac2a144122e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,211,43,49,140,51,119,176,29,69,134,116,94,178,172,42,20,65,34,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
