Since a spanning tree is a minimally connected subgraph, graphs and multigraphs having more of these are, in some sense, immune to disconnection by edge failure. We employ a matrix-theoretic approach to the calculation of the number of spanning trees.\nThe authors envision this as a research aid that is of particular interest to graduate students or advanced undergraduate students and researchers in the area of network reliability theory. This would encompass graph theorists of all stripes, including mathematicians, computer scientists, electrical and computer engineers, and operations researchers.\n\nReadership: Graduate students and researchers in combinatorics and graph theory.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 186 pages\nPublisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (November 2, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9814566039\nISBN-13: 978-9814566032\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0644a2c30a07a83648ba10dd82986940695008","amp;dn":"Spanning+Tree+Results+for+Graphs+and+Multigraphs%3A+A+Matrix-Theor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0644a2c30a07a83648ba10dd82986940695008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,6,68,162,195,10,7,168,54,72,186,16,221,130,152,105,64,105,80,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
