Had to track these episodes down on usenet and ed2k(emule) in order to have them and wanted to spare others the aggravation. All of these were scene releases in ENGLISH and I have attached the English subtitles for those who want them (although I'm not sure if all are in sync). NOTE: Episode 6 is MY release because the original scene release was missing the first ~39sec of footage, so I tracked down a 720p copy that was complete but it was in french. I re-synced and remuxed ENGLISH audio onto it from a DVD that I have. So episode 6 has french Video with English Audio and I re-synced English subtitles for my release, including all important part from the video that are in french (i.e. show title, places, dates, etc.)\nEnjoy and please seed if you download:) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b97928fdb2fa4d5a19bb1a6d0b25f91b9be2c3","amp;dn":"Law+And+Order+UK+Season+2+Complete+720p+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b97928fdb2fa4d5a19bb1a6d0b25f91b9be2c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,185,121,40,253,178,250,77,90,25,187,26,109,11,37,249,27,155,226,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
