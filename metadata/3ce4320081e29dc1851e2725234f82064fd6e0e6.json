While his brother is fair of hair and lithe in body, Eamon sparks fear with his fiery locks and massive frame-and rumors of a mysterious power. But when his brother has the good fortune to be betrothed to a beautiful stranger, it's Eamon's help-and quick wit and romantic heart--that he needs. Eamon agrees to write the noble lady...a generous offer that will forever leave him a changed man.\n\nLady Luella Jane Moran has no interest in an arranged marriage and tries valiantly to dissuade her betrothed from afar. Though her own letters plainly state her case, the words her husband-to-be writes her leave her aching for his touch. Will Lu give in to the desire the missives have kindled within her? Or will desire turn cold when she discovers their true author?\nGenre: Paranormal Romance ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce4320081e29dc1851e2725234f82064fd6e0e6","amp;dn":"Entwined+-+Kristen+Callihan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce4320081e29dc1851e2725234f82064fd6e0e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,228,50,0,129,226,157,193,133,30,39,37,35,79,130,6,79,214,224,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
