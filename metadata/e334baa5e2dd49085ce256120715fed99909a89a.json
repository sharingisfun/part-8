In July 1683 Sultan Mehmet IV proclaimed a jihad and the Turkish grand vizier, Kara Mustafa Pasha, laid siege to the city with an army of 150,000 men.\n\nIn September a relieving force arrived under Polish command and joined up with the defenders to drive the Turks away. The main focus of this book is the final 15-hour battle for Vienna, which climaxed with a massive charge by three divisions of Polish winged hussars. This hard-won victory marked the beginning of the decline of the Islamic Ottoman Empire, which was never to threaten central Europe again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e334baa5e2dd49085ce256120715fed99909a89a","amp;dn":"Vienna+1683%3A+Christian+Europe+Repels+the+Ottomans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e334baa5e2dd49085ce256120715fed99909a89a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,52,186,165,226,221,73,8,92,226,86,18,7,21,254,217,153,9,168,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
