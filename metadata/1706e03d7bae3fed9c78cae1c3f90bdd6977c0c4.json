The unit known only to a few at the command level, occasionally cross the line and pull back just in time.\n\nI initially believed this was just another LAPD cop show. I was pleasently surprised that it is not. The show is well acted and has a twisted dynamic among the characters which makes the show quite watchable.\n\nThis torrent contains all 10 episodes of the first season.\n\nXviD Avi\n\nNote: Files recorded at time of broadcast.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1706e03d7bae3fed9c78cae1c3f90bdd6977c0c4","amp;dn":"Dark+Blue+%282009%29+Season+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1706e03d7bae3fed9c78cae1c3f90bdd6977c0c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,6,224,61,123,174,63,237,156,120,202,225,195,249,11,221,105,119,192,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
