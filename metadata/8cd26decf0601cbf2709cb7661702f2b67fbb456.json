Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 \r\nducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend \r\nAntonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed \r\nhim out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor â€“ his ships and merchandise \r\nare busy at sea â€“ he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so \r\nBassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's \r\nguarantor.&quot;\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n  Included here are the dvd features provided with the disk for this production.  \r\nCasting is a particular point of interest.  Makram Khoury is interviewed and is a \r\nPalestinian from Israel.  The set for the RSC is also  profiled in a separate \r\nfeaturette.\r\n\r\n For those who want to follow this play with English subtitles, the VOB subs are \r\nselectable from the menu in your VLC player.\r\n\r\n  In the my collection at TPB  is another Merchant of Venice.  That one is set in \r\nPre-War Nazi Germany directed by Trevor Nunn.  Both productions have  highlights \r\nthat make them exceptional.  Watch for the cabaret song in the Trevor Nunn \r\nproduction.  \r\n\r\n  As always, these encodes are a way for those interested to get them for their \r\nlibraries that others may enjoy them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd26decf0601cbf2709cb7661702f2b67fbb456","amp;dn":"RSC++Live+The+Merchant+of+Venice+%282016%29++w+ENG+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd26decf0601cbf2709cb7661702f2b67fbb456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,210,109,236,240,96,28,191,39,9,203,118,97,112,47,43,103,251,180,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
