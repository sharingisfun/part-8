I'm Casey Kasem and the countdown doesn't stop until we get to our new number one best seller.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey tells about the most successful double-sided single in the history of the soul chart. This record by the Coasters it stayed at number one for 13 weeks and Casey plays some of both sides.\n\nThis is the first week on the chart for &quot;Margaritaville&quot; by Jimmy Buffett (at number 37) and the only week for the new number one, &quot;Hotel California&quot; by the Eagles.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;What was the rock era's oldest group to make the top 40?&quot; Casey reports the three brothers in this group had their last chart hit in 1958, when they were all in their 50's.\n\nNatalie Cole is at number eight with her hit, &quot;I've Got Love On My Mind.&quot; Casey mentions her father, the legendary Nat King Cole, and calls him the fifth biggest recording act in the entire history of the pop chart.\n\nThere is no Premire Radio Networks announcer after Casey says, &quot;Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.&quot; This is how it sounded back in 1977 (when I was 12-years-old) recording AT40 from a transistor radio (with my shoebox cassette tape recorder) on Sunday nights. I always tried to get my favorite songs because I didn't have money to buy the 45's. I guess I didn't know what I was getting into! Now I call it the countdown that never stops.\n\n40:    Undercover Angel - Alan O'Day\n39:    Love's Grown Deep - Kenny Nolan\n38:    Back In The Saddle - Aerosmith        \n37:    Margaritaville - Jimmy Buffett     \n36:    Cinderella - Firefall     \n35:    Show You The Way To Go - The Jacksons    \n34:    My Sweet Lady - John Denver\n33:    Cherry Baby - Starz\n32:    Uptown Festival - Shalimar\n31:    Love Theme From &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; - Barbra Streisand\n30:    Rich Girl - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n29:    Gonna Fly Now (Theme From &quot;Rocky&quot;) - Bill Conti    \n28:    Whodunit - Tavares\n27:    Heard It In A Love Song - Marshall Tucker Band\n26:    Dreams - Fleetwood Mac\n25:    Dancing Man - Q\n24:    Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman) - Joe Tex\n23:    Trying To Love Two - William Bell\n22:    Feels Like The First Time - Foreigner\n21:    Angel In Your Arms - Hot\n20:    Lonely Boy - Andrew Gold\n19:    Hello Stranger - Yvonne Elliman\n18:    Calling Dr. Love - Kiss\n17:    Lucille - Kenny Rogers\n16:    Don't Give Up On Us - David Soul\n15:    Your Love - Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr.\n14:    Got To Give It Up Part 1 - Marvin Gaye\n13:    Can't Stop Dancing - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n12:    Lido Shuffle - Boz Scaggs\n11:    I'm Your Boogie Man - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n10:    I Wanna Get Next To You - Rose Royce\n9:    Couldn't Get It Right - Climax Blues Band\n8:    I've Got Love On My Mind - Natalie Cole\n7:    So In To You - Atlanta Rhythm Section\n6:    Right Time Of The Night - Jennifer Warnes\n5:    Don't Leave Me This Way - Thelma Houston\n4:    Sir Duke - Stevie Wonder\n3:    Southern Nights - Glen Campbell\n2:    When I Need You - Leo Sayer\n1:    Hotel California - The Eagles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7184f423cc0ffcf4cd9a4e45855e0ccb49df17d6","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1977_May_7th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7184f423cc0ffcf4cd9a4e45855e0ccb49df17d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,132,244,35,204,15,252,244,205,154,78,69,133,94,12,203,73,223,23,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
