Although the brothers DJed in the late 1980 and were remixing and composing as far back as the early 1990s, they were largely popularised by the British Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson in around 2001. The brothers are currently signed to Compost Records.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kyotojazzmassive.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kyotojazzmassive.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffb46edf07af680d488d3ce736c0355944194a5","amp;dn":"kyoto+jazz+massive+-+spirit+of+the+sun+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffb46edf07af680d488d3ce736c0355944194a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,251,70,237,240,122,246,128,212,136,211,206,115,108,3,85,148,65,148,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
