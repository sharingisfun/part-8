From shady frog jumping contests to a fixed goat race, Fatty uses his enterprise to raise enough money to buy a crystal set (wireless radio) that's worth seventeen shillings &amp; sixpence (17/6), more than his Dad earns in a year. Bruiser Murphy the bully and his gang try to stop him. Fatty uses his brains against his enemies' brawn to eventually triumph.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:057735ecfc0b33c0ef3c18791ea26cb4d7094af3","amp;dn":"Fatty.Finn.1980.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"057735ecfc0b33c0ef3c18791ea26cb4d7094af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,119,53,236,252,11,51,192,239,60,24,121,30,162,108,180,215,9,74,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
