She goes to class (most of the time), fights with her mom, and crushes on a boy or two. But around her sixteenth birthday, Chloe finds that perhaps she is not so normal after all. There is the heightened night vision, the super fast reflexes oh, and the claws.\n\nAs she discovers who she is and where she comes from it is clear she is not alone. And someone is trying to get her.\n\nChloe has nine lives. But will nine be enough?\n\n\nLanguage : English\n\nPart 1 : The Fallen\nPart 2 : The Stolen\nPart 3 : The Chosen\n\nAll the parts are included in the one PDF-file (1151 pages)\n\nSorry for my English and for my first handing-out ever :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6deda8302075020db48e78e4ec8689353e79276","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+J.+Braswell+--+The+Nine+Lives+of+Chloe+King+%28Thrilogy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6deda8302075020db48e78e4ec8689353e79276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,222,218,131,2,7,80,32,219,72,231,142,78,200,104,147,83,231,146,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
