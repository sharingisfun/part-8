If the mountains have not already decided the winner then this stage will be critical in the battle for yellow. A rolling 54km between Bergerac and Perigueux, it is not a course necessarily suited to the specialists in the discipline like Martin or Cancellara, so quite a few riders could be in with a chance of glory today. Presented by Gary Imlach with analysis from Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen with Ned Boulting the reporter at the roadside.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 1.45 GB\nRun-Time__: 2h 15 min\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=25 ~1447Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 24/48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\ndb.tt/wHGqEnKq\ntwitter[dot]com/JungleBoyNX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a447fc869fd34aff9307c69a2e1a72552b524ba","amp;dn":"ITV.Tour.de.France.2014.Stage.20.Live.PDTV.x264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a447fc869fd34aff9307c69a2e1a72552b524ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,68,127,200,105,253,52,175,249,48,124,105,162,225,167,37,82,181,36,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
