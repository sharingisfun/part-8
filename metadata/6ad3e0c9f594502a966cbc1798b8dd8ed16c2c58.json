A solitary traveler is captured by a fascist military group called the Holnists led by Hitler-like General Bethlehem. When he escapes from the Holnists he finds an abandoned mail Jeep and uniform, and starts to travel through small cities, telling them he is a postman, a representative of the restored United States. No one believes him at first, but soon he has followers, and they start to prepare a revolt against Holnists.\n\n\nAll stand-alone DivX Players compatible\n\n\nU P L O A D E R S  F I N A L  N O T E S\n\n\nPlease seed!
