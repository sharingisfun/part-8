Beautifully controlled, liberatingly intelligent... it establishes Haneke as one of the more remarkable young contempory filmmakers. The climatic half hour of this film ranks among the mosy truly terrifying in the modern cinema.&quot; Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune\n\n&quot;A powerful, provocative and highly disturbing Austrian film... a shocking and potent statement about out times...Devasting impact.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader\n\nThe first part of Haneke&amp;#039;s trilogy dealing with the &amp;#039;emotional glaciation&amp;#039; of contemporary Austria, this deploys a pared, matter of fact, almost Bressonian visual and narrative style to chart the preparations made by a youngish, well-to-do couple who decide, quite coolly, to take their own lives and that of their uncomprehending young daughter. Though no explicit explanation is given for their decision, Haneke&amp;#039;s attention to detail is such that the malaise affecting them and the frustrations of conformity soon become apparent. Moreover, the stark, calm visuals, the understated performances, and the measured but inexorable pace of the film gradually build to a terrifying emotional intensity. Hugely chastening, strangely beautiful, and extremely impressive. \n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\nSimply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad12cbd1b53223d4db90f03557ea8963b2c8730d","amp;dn":"Der+Siebente+Kontinent+%28Michael+Haneke%2C+1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad12cbd1b53223d4db90f03557ea8963b2c8730d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,18,203,209,181,50,35,212,219,144,240,53,87,234,137,99,178,200,115,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
