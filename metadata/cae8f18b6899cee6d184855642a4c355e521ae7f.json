Agent Connie Clausen enables him to be a 'resident alien', writing film reviews and dispensing words of wisdom. Curious about but impervious to trends, he describes AIDS as a &quot;fad, nothing more&quot;, actually to divert heterosexual anger but he is misinterpreted and reviled by many gays. A return to popularity occurs when he helps Patrick Angus, a young,AIDS-afflicted artist attain fame for his paintings and his healthy cynicism is marketed by performance artist Penny Arcade, putting him back in the limelight. Poor health causes him to refuse a lecture tour of England but he gives a triumphant final audience at a gay club in Tampa.A postscript informs that he died at the age of 91","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae8f18b6899cee6d184855642a4c355e521ae7f","amp;dn":"An.Englishman.in.New.York.2009.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-LPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cae8f18b6899cee6d184855642a4c355e521ae7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,232,241,139,104,153,206,230,209,132,133,86,66,164,195,85,229,33,174,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
