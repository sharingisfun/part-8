Go for it! :D\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDNA evidence collected from death scenes is an essential tool for law enforcement, death investigators, and forensic pathologistsÃ¢â‚¬â€providing insights into cause and manner of death as well as the identification of the responsible person or persons. Ineffective collection procedures raise the risk of evidence being altered or lost during transportation of the body. Using real death scene photos and actual cases as examples, Forensic DNA Collection at Death Scenes: A Pictorial Guide provides a practical approach to evidence collection with emphasis on proper identification, collection, documentation, and preservation.\n\nThe first atlas of its kind, it demonstrates best practices for collecting DNA from decedents depending on the circumstances of the death scene and other materials present on the decedent such as clothing, bindings, and other objects. The authors discuss the success of the techniques employed in each scenario and analyze the DNA results obtained. The techniques employed at death scenes can also be applied to sexual assault cases, where DNA is collected from the body after an assault takes place.\n\nThe increasing applications of evidence-based medicine and forensic science to criminal justice and civil litigation demand that crime scene investigations be more scientific, better organized, and multidisciplinary. This atlas provides a step-by-step guide to effective, uncompromising evidence collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efd873d1d0c7dc12111b508da3eac4c74464cc2","amp;dn":"Forensic+DNA+Collection+at+Death+Scenes+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efd873d1d0c7dc12111b508da3eac4c74464cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,253,135,61,29,12,125,193,33,17,181,8,218,62,172,76,116,70,76,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
