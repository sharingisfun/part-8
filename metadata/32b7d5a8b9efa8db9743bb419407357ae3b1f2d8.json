Though the story is set in 17th-century Salem, Massachusetts, the film was lensed in Spain. Senta Berger is surprisingly well cast as Hester Prynne, whose sexual indiscretions have compelled her to wear the letter &quot;A&quot; (for adultery) on blouse--a symbol of shame to her neighbors, but a strange source of pride for Hester. Lou Castel plays the tortured Reverend Dimmesdale, the man who impregnated Hester but whom has been sworn to secrecy by the self-sacrificing heroine for the &quot;good of the community.&quot; Hans Christian Blech portrays Hester's long-lost husband, whose reappearance sets the stage for the wrenching climax. Wenders' interpretation of the customs, behavior and inbred bigotry of the early American immigrants is eye-opening, as only an &quot;outsider's&quot; perception of what we take for granted can be. \n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b7d5a8b9efa8db9743bb419407357ae3b1f2d8","amp;dn":"The+Scarlet+Letter+1973+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b7d5a8b9efa8db9743bb419407357ae3b1f2d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,183,213,168,185,239,168,219,151,67,187,65,148,7,53,122,227,177,242,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
