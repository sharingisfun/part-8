Never is the audiences attention allowed outside of Joe's point of view. We see only what he sees, we hear nothing more and we remember his life in little snatches, moments of dark disgusting and secret clarity he keeps from the world.\n\nThe film starts with a corpse, a barely dressed woman floating in the Clyde that is fished out by Joe; a young man working the barges for reasons that are not immediately clear. This brutal beginning in which we see Joe lay a tender hand on the cold dead flesh of the girl begins the film with a level of tension that rarely leaves the screen. Through his actions and - more importantly - his inactions we peel away the outer layers of a man on the run from himself, from responsibility and from guilt. We see him commit two murders by mission of inaction and we see him quietly dealing with that in one last lingering shot that tells us he will never change.\n\nJoe is sexually driven to destroy life around him and he uses sex as a weapon against himself and against the possibility of settling or creating a future. He could be a writer, but he lacks the courage to read his own work. He could be a father, but he cannot face the thought of commitment. He could be a lover, but he makes love to women only as a means to an end, rejecting and pushing them away once the act is completed.\n\t\nTiTlE : Young Adam (2003) \n*********************************************************************************\n\n[RELEASE INFORMATION] \n\nSOURCE ******* : NTSC DVD_RC3 \nRIPPER ******* : TEAM_CiPA (ZiNi) \nREL DATE ***** : 2005.08.25\nVIDEO INFO *** : XviD_1.0.3 @ 1564 Kbps Avg \nAUDIO INFO *** : AC3 5.1CH @ 448 Kbps                   \nFRAME RATE *** : 23.976 fps \nRESOLUTION *** : 720 x 304 \nLANGUAGE ***** : English \nSUBTITLE ***** : Korean , Francais\nGenre ******** : Drama / Crime / Thriller  \nRUNTIME ****** : 01:37:03\nREL FILES **** : Young.Adam.2003.XviD.AC3.CD1-CiPA.avi (699.2MB)\n                 Young.Adam.2003.XviD.AC3.CD2-CiPA.avi (699.7MB)\n \n                 \n                 \n***********************************************************************************\n\n[MOVIE INFORMATION] \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/detail.nhn?code=37559&amp;mb=c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/detail.nhn?code=37559&amp;mb=c&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289635/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289635/&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385b52491dd918949e7542b3319b588cd9169b73","amp;dn":"Young.Adam.2003.Uncut.XviD.AC3-CiPA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385b52491dd918949e7542b3319b588cd9169b73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,91,82,73,29,217,24,148,158,117,66,179,49,155,88,140,217,22,155,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
