When we make mistakes, we must calm the cognitive dissonance that jars our feelings of self-worth. And so we create fictions that absolve us of responsibility, restoring our belief that we are smart, moral, and right a belief that often keeps us on a course that is dumb, immoral, and wrong. Backed by years of research and delivered in lively, energetic prose, Mistakes Were  Made (But Not by Me) offers a fascinating explanation of self-deception, how it works, the harm it can cause, and how we can overcome it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a2fcdb22855fc0a5a21a9e3fb7dd41f953e1b0","amp;dn":"Mistakes+Were+Made+But+Not+By+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a2fcdb22855fc0a5a21a9e3fb7dd41f953e1b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,162,252,219,34,133,95,192,165,162,26,158,63,183,221,65,249,83,225,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
