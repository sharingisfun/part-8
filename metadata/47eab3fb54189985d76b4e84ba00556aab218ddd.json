Although he is frequently linked with Claude Debussy as an exemplar of musical impressionism, and some of their works have a surface resemblance, Ravel possessed an independent voice that grew out of his love of a broad variety of styles, including the French Baroque, Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Spanish folk traditions, and American jazz and blues. His elegant and lyrically generous body of work was not large in comparison with that of some of his contemporaries, but his compositions are notable for being meticulously and exquisitely crafted. He was especially gifted as an orchestrator, an area in which he remains unsurpassed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47eab3fb54189985d76b4e84ba00556aab218ddd","amp;dn":"Maurice+Ravel+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47eab3fb54189985d76b4e84ba00556aab218ddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,234,179,251,84,24,153,133,215,107,78,132,186,0,85,106,171,33,141,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
