Interpolated frames have been also sharpened to match more or\nless the level of sharpness of the original source frames. This is NOT the real\nthing! Frame interpolation is not perfect and will never be! May and will contain\ntraces of ghosting and haloing! Don't complain about it, you have been warned! If\nyou want the real deal, buy the 48 fps master or go to the cinema!(thanks Marin!)\n\nThis release is in 2 parts,just like the 3D Bluray,this is so the audios &amp; subs from the Bluray can be added to each part(if you require)with mkvmerge,without going out of sync,mkvmerge can then be used to merge the 2 files into 1(if you wish) using the append function.\n\n\n\nPlayback\n\nPlayed from external hard drive to Himedia 900B standalone media player to 3D TV\nPlayed from pc to 3D TV\nWould not play from Hard drive to Samsung 3D TV's built in media player software(may play on other tv's)\n\nBig Thanks to Marin(UberHD)for his help with this release!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28784f0d566e7de7bc2af0f7b2437a9a3f608b41","amp;dn":"The.Hobbit.An.Unexpected.Journey.48fps.Edition.3D.2012.1080p.Blu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28784f0d566e7de7bc2af0f7b2437a9a3f608b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,120,79,13,86,110,125,231,188,42,240,247,178,67,122,154,63,96,139,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
