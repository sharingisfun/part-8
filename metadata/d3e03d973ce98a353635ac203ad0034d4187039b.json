With the once viscerally powerful Who in limbo, the guitarist nearly sunk himself into brandy-drenched oblivion. He emerged with one of his most gripping solo pieces and--perhaps unsurprisingly--the most Who-like album of all his solo work.\n\nPete plunges into his familiar themes of aging, sexuality, and spiritual decay with fervor, desperation, and commitment. And while EMPTY GLASS does not approach the roaring physicality of the Who at its best, the emotional punch of &quot;Jools and Jim&quot; and &quot;I Am an Animal&quot; is sure to rattle the cage of even the most ardent hard rock devotee. Also of note are Townshend's vocals. Through the entire album, whether on the radio-ready paean to Meher Baba &quot;Let My Love Open the Door,&quot; the bracing &quot;Rough Boys,&quot; or the sublime &quot;A Little Is Enough,&quot; his vocals are hanging on the edge of a cliff, presumably dangling over a certain death.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
