This is what the Ford Techs use when they work on your vehicle.\n\nThis is a reseed of the 2005/2006 Ford Factory Manual.  The files were originally provided by http://www.fordcds.com.  For some reason the site is down and the original torrents are dead.\n\n\nTO USE:  \n\n1.  Load this .iso using your favorite drive emulator.\n2.  Browse to the &quot;cd&quot;\n3.  Install the program.  \n4.  Set your computer's clock to sometime in 2005.  \n\nI've found that July 2005 works just fine.  If you don't, the CD determines your disc is out of date and the program will not work.  Says to discard disc and insert new disc.\n\n5.  Open the Manual using the installed link in your Start Menu.\n6.  Enjoy\n\nThis Manual covers all 2005/2006 Fords/Lincolns.  Probably Mercury as well.\n\nRemember to seed as well.  Please don't hit and run","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa2b8cdc6f884767ba717b55bb3fad4dd0b34ec1","amp;dn":"2005%2F2006+Ford+Factory+Service+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa2b8cdc6f884767ba717b55bb3fad4dd0b34ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,43,140,220,111,136,71,103,186,113,123,85,187,63,173,77,208,179,78,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
