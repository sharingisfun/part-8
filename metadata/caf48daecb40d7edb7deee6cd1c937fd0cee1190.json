As much a work of art as a book about mathematics, Beautiful Geometry presents more than sixty exquisite color plates illustrating a wide range of geometric patterns and theorems, accompanied by brief accounts of the fascinating history and people behind each. With artwork by Swiss artist Eugen Jost and text by acclaimed math historian Eli Maor, this unique celebration of geometry covers numerous subjects, from straightedge-and-compass constructions to intriguing configurations involving infinity. The result is a delightful and informative illustrated tour through the 2,500-year-old history of one of the most important and beautiful branches of mathematics.\n\n208 pages\nPrinceton University Press, Jan 2014.\nISBN-10: 0691150990\nISBN-13: 978-0691150994\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf48daecb40d7edb7deee6cd1c937fd0cee1190","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Geometry+-+Eli+Maor%2C+Eugen+Jost+%282014%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf48daecb40d7edb7deee6cd1c937fd0cee1190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,244,141,174,203,64,215,237,183,222,238,108,209,201,55,253,12,238,17,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
