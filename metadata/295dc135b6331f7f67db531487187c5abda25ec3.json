It has a sweet beautiful flow that takes you from the heart into deep meditation. The Binaural Beats start in Alpha, then transition to Theta, to Delta, then to Deep meditation Sub-Delta.\n\nThis track works well for background listening but is most effective when listened to with full attention. It is especially effective for kissing and making love. It is also really good for reflecting on your whole life.\n\n30 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295dc135b6331f7f67db531487187c5abda25ec3","amp;dn":"Enlightenment+Meditation+by+Globe+Institute+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295dc135b6331f7f67db531487187c5abda25ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,93,193,53,182,51,31,127,103,219,83,20,135,24,124,90,189,162,94,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
