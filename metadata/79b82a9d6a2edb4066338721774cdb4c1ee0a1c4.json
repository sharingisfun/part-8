From there we'll study some other examples of atmospheric effects such as misty and foggy conditions as well as sunsets. Along the way we'll explore how we can incorporate these different atmospheric effects into an illustration.\n\nAs we'll see, adding atmosphere to an illustration can strengthen the depth and perspective of the scene along with reinforcing the visual direction of the composition. By implementing the concepts we cover about atmosphere in this course, you'll be able to push the visual depth, direction, and appeal of your own illustrations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79b82a9d6a2edb4066338721774cdb4c1ee0a1c4","amp;dn":"DigitalTutors+-+Creating+Atmospheric+Depth+for+Illustrations+in+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79b82a9d6a2edb4066338721774cdb4c1ee0a1c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,184,42,157,106,46,219,64,102,51,135,33,119,76,219,76,30,224,161,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
