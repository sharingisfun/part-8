Created and hosted by double-act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer; it uses the panel show format but with the comedians' often slapstick, surreal and anarchic humour does not rely on rules in order to function, with the pair apparently ignoring existing rules or inventing new ones as and when the mood takes them.\n\nPlease seed at a decent speed.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nTSV\n\n\nDon't let this show die, seed please. Most TV shows I upload are shown around the world and there's no problem getting seeders because there are lots downloading. This show is only downloaded by the Brits so we need a higher percentage of downloaders to seed it or it will die. Please do your bit.\n\nI really wanna see those seeders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b95f0ead6f6d5c839b49b294533989faf91a7c","amp;dn":"Shooting+Stars+Season+1+-+8+%2B+Extras+VHS+DVDRip+HDTV+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84b95f0ead6f6d5c839b49b294533989faf91a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,185,95,14,173,111,109,92,131,155,73,178,148,83,57,137,250,249,26,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
