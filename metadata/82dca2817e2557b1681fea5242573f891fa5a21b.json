Not all styles fit Sambora&amp;#039;s bluesy hard rock foundation, but it&amp;#039;s interesting to listen to him try out blues-rock, power ballads, pop/rock, arena rock, and Stonesy rock, even if he&amp;#039;s not always successful. Sambora has a pleasantly bland voice and knows how to craft a hard rock song, even if he doesn&amp;#039;t always come up with a good hook. The result is a respectable journeyman album filled with competent songwriting and fine guitar playing -- just the kind of record that will appeal to his fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82dca2817e2557b1681fea5242573f891fa5a21b","amp;dn":"Richie+Sambora+-+Undiscovered+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82dca2817e2557b1681fea5242573f891fa5a21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,220,162,129,126,37,87,177,104,31,234,82,66,87,63,137,31,165,162,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
