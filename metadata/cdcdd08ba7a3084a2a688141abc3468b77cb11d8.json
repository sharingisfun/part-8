H. B. Smith 3rd Edition\n\nThis 656 page 1961 book is an encyclopedic reference book on single-shot, repeating, and semi-automatic rifles used in 51 countries around the world. The `Publisher's Forward' says &quot;a rifle is an American tradition&quot;. It offered protection and secured food. Rifles f rom other countries were sold in America, often at bargain prices. This book was written to identify these rifles. Various publications differ as to the measurements of these rifles. Some are due to conversion from the metric system, others to the varying weight of the wooden parts and attachments.\n\n\n# Publisher \tCastle Books (January 1, 1948)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ASIN \tB0007HWQFS\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/book-rifles-W-H-Smith/dp/B0007HWQFS/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372456357&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+book+of+rifles+1948&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/book-rifles-W-H-Smith/dp/B0007HWQFS/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372456357&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=the+book+of+rifles+1948&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eanAGaAeI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eanAGaAeI&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcdd08ba7a3084a2a688141abc3468b77cb11d8","amp;dn":"The+book+of+rifles+by+W.H.B+Smith+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcdd08ba7a3084a2a688141abc3468b77cb11d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,205,208,139,167,163,8,74,42,104,129,65,171,195,70,139,119,203,17,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
