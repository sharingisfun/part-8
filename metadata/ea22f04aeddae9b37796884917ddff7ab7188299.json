The series blends magic and primitive technology and the books are set in the Four Lands which in some books is identified as Earth long after civilization as we know it was destroyed in a chemical and nuclear holocaust called the Great Wars. By the time of the prequel First King of Shannara, the world has now reverted to a medieval state and magic has re-emerged to supplement science as humans and other races live in a place known as the Four Lands, which is a future North America. Further into the novels science starts to become more advanced.\n\nShannara is the name of an Elven noble family. \nMany of the protagonists in the series are descended from this family, beginning with Jerle Shannara.\n\n\nIncluded in this torrent:\n\nPrequel\n1.
