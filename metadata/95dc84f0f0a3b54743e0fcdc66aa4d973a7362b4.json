Moore Jr., Duncan J. Maitland (CRC, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nBiomedical Technology and Devices, Second Edition focuses on the equipment, devices, and techniques used in modern medicine to diagnose, treat, and monitor human illnesses. Gathering together and compiling the latest information available on medical technology, this revised work adds ten new chapters. It starts with the basics, introducing the history of the thermometer and measuring body temperature, before moving on to a medley of devices that are far more complex.\r\n\r\nThis book explores diverse technological functions and procedures including signal processing, auditory systems, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonic and emission imaging, image-guided thermal therapy, medical robotics, shape memory alloys, biophotonics, and tissue engineering. Each chapter offers a description of the technique, its technical considerations, and its use according to its applications and relevant body systems. It can be used as a professional resource, as well as a textbook for undergraduate and graduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95dc84f0f0a3b54743e0fcdc66aa4d973a7362b4","amp;dn":"Biomedical+Technology+and+Devices+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95dc84f0f0a3b54743e0fcdc66aa4d973a7362b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,220,132,240,240,163,181,71,67,224,252,220,102,170,77,151,58,115,98,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
