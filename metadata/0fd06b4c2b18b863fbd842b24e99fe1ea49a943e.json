Assembling a quartet from Kent, England, comprising fellow Prisoner bass player Alan Crockford and ex-Daggermen personnel Simon Howard (drums) and Taylor's brother David (guitar), the band recorded a BBC session for disc jockey John Peel before Taylor retired to Sweden for a break. However, the broadcast made such an impression that the band was signed to new &quot;mod&quot; label Re-Elect the President. A mini-album of cover versions, Mission Impossible, featured &quot;organ groovy&quot; '60s soundtrack instrumentals like the single &quot;Blow Up,&quot; with Jimmy Smith and Booker T. &amp; the MG's providing the strongest influences. The Money Spyder took the theme a stage further; while the Damned had mocked the psychedelic soundtrack as Naz Nomad &amp; the Nightmares, the JTQ reminisced on the beat and jazz age. Taylor become frustrated with the band's limitations, and by the time Wait a Minute appeared on Polydor Records dance offshoot, Urban, in September 1988, only his brother remained with him in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.75% CDDA &amp; 99.80% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRetro Music\nCatalog:\t\tR 2 CD 40-103\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Blow Up (Live)\n02.It's Your World\n03.Summer Fantasy\n04.Green Onions (Live)\n05.Good Thing\n06.Selectivity\n07.Love The Life (Live)\n08.Redneck\n09.Starting Too Slow (Live)\n10.Europa\n11.Mrs. Robinson\n12.Untitled Part 1\n13.Journey\n14.Black Gun (Live)\n15.In The Hand Of The Inevitable\n16.Whole Lotta Love\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Don't Let Money Be Your God\n02.3 Mile Island\n03.It's Your World (Live)\n04.One Way Street\n05.Grass Is Not Greener\n06.Valhalla (Live)\n07.Check It Out\n08.Creation\n09.I Hope I Pray (Live)\n10.A Good Thing\n11.Untitled Part 2\n12.Fourth Dimension\n13.Free Your Mind\n14.Keep The Dream Alive\n15.Haitian Breakdown / Starsky &amp; Hutch (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd06b4c2b18b863fbd842b24e99fe1ea49a943e","amp;dn":"The+James+Taylor+Quartet+-+Anthology+%282006%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd06b4c2b18b863fbd842b24e99fe1ea49a943e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,208,107,76,43,24,184,99,251,216,66,178,78,153,254,30,164,154,148,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
