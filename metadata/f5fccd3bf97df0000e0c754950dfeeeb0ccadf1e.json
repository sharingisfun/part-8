Personally I enjoy and appreciate Dando's ability to craft and cover great tunes that range from clever pop guitar (I'll Do It Anyway) to Country/Parody (Big Gay Heart) to Rock (Down About It) and the whimsical, folky sound of &quot;Being Around&quot;.\n\nGenuine fans of &quot;Real Music&quot; (rather than the mass-manufactured FM-friendly CRAP than dominates westerm music charts) could do a lot worse than acquiring the Lemonheads final trilogy of &quot;Shame About Ray&quot;, &quot;Come On Feel The Lemonheads&quot; and &quot;Car Button Cloth&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fccd3bf97df0000e0c754950dfeeeb0ccadf1e","amp;dn":"The+Lemonheads+-+Come+on+Feel+the+Lemonheads+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fccd3bf97df0000e0c754950dfeeeb0ccadf1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,252,205,59,249,125,240,0,14,12,117,73,80,223,238,235,12,202,223,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
