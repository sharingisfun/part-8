Catering to all knowledge levels from beer novices to basement brewers and seasoned pros to sommelliers, the book highlights 150 of Australia's greatest beers, whether they are incredibly 'sessionable', perfect examples of their style, off-the-wall with flavour or quirky and experimental. James Smith outlines the history of beer in Australia and the rise (then fall, then rise) of craft beer in the country. In his engaging style, he explains technicalities of the brewing process, how to match food with beer, and how to store, serve and enjoy beer. The book is divided by beer styles, with detailed run-downs of what makes each unique, and every beer entry includes a tasting note, a backstory, brewery information and the brewer's own serving suggestions and favourite food match","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8fcd61e1ba4c1749ab12f48a6b59b76ab76cc4","amp;dn":"150+Great+Australian+Beers+%282014%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8fcd61e1ba4c1749ab12f48a6b59b76ab76cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,143,205,97,225,186,76,23,73,171,18,244,138,107,89,183,106,183,108,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
