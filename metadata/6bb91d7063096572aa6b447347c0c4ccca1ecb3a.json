It features an exciting full color format which uses color to enhance the instructional value of photographs, illustrations, tables, charts, and graphs. Throughout the book's coverage, the use of mathematics is limited to only those concepts that are needed for understanding. \n\nFloyd's acclaimed troubleshooting emphasis, as always, provides learners with the problem solving experience they need for a successful career in electronics. Chapter topics cover components, quantities and units; voltage, current, and resistance; Ohm's Law; energy and power; series circuits; parallel circuits; series-parallel circuits; circuit theorems and conversions; branch, mesh, and node analysis; magnetism and electromagnetism; an introduction to alternating current and voltage; phasors and complex numbers;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb91d7063096572aa6b447347c0c4ccca1ecb3a","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Electric+Circuits+-+8th+Edition+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb91d7063096572aa6b447347c0c4ccca1ecb3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,185,29,112,99,9,101,114,170,107,68,115,71,192,196,204,202,30,203,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
