But in retrospect, those albums feel less developed than The Peoples Key. It starts off as a largely experimental and conceptual record, opening with a strange but fascinating commentary on the expanding universe, time travel, UFOs and the origins of life. But this isnt an overly affected art-rock album that takes itself too seriously. It is Bright Eyes most infectious record to date, with captivating melodies and rhythms.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Folk, Indie\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
