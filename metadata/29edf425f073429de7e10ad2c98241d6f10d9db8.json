TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re where productivity goes to die, right? There has to be a better way. According to leading consultants Dick and Emily Axelrod, there is. Using the same principles that make video games so engaging and that transformed the numbing assembly line into the dynamic shop floor, the Axelrods outline a flexible and adaptable system used to run truly productive meetings in all kinds of organizationsÃ¢â‚¬â€meetings where people create concrete plans, accomplish tasks, build connections, and move projects forward. They show how to design every aspect of a meetingÃ¢â‚¬â€from the way you greet people at the beginning to how you sum up at the endÃ¢â‚¬â€so that real work actually gets done. Those who have adopted this system will never go back. Neither will you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29edf425f073429de7e10ad2c98241d6f10d9db8","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Stop+Meeting+Like+This%3A+Tools+to+Save+Time+and+Get+More+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29edf425f073429de7e10ad2c98241d6f10d9db8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,237,244,37,240,115,66,157,231,225,10,210,201,130,65,214,241,13,157,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
