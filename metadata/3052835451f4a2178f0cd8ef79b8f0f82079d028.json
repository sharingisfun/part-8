Detective Michael Bennett, along with his old pal, the FBI's Emily Parker, have to catch the shadowy criminals who claim responsibility - but they're as good at concealing their identities as they are at wreaking havoc.\r\nIn the wake of a shocking assassination, Bennett begins to suspect that these mysterious events are just the prelude to the biggest threat of all.
