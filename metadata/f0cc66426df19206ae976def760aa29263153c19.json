Her mixed media paintings are layered with found images, fragments of text from old books, and pieces of vintage maps. These ephemera become the fabric and focus of many of her whimsical paintings.Sarah has taught art to many students in a variety of settings ranging from art camps to museums, teaching students age 3 to 63. Most recently, Sarah was invited to teach her mixed media techniques at Squam Art Workshops, and is thrilled to be returning for two more sessions in fall of 2010.Sarah and her work have been featured in Cloth Paper Scissors magazine (Nov/Dec 2008), Artful Blogging (winter 09/10), Cloth Paper Scissors: Studios (fall 2008), and Memory Makers magazine (spring 2009), as well as on a number of prominent art and design blogs.
