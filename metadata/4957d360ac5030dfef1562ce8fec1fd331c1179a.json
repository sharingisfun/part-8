Unique in its use of concise 'mini-review' articles, this praised work covers biological, molecular, and medical topics concerning viruses in animals, plants, bacteria and insects. Now in five volumes, this new edition has been extensively revised and updated to reflect the 50 per cent increase in identified and accepted viruses since the year 2000. With over 25 per cent new chapters and over 1000 illustrations, this edition takes into account the new developments in virology research by including information on new emerging diseases such as avian flu, SARS and West Nile and the ability of some viruses to be used as agents of bioterrorism. Edited by leading Virologists Mahy and van Regenmortel, this third edition remains the number one all-inclusive source of information for virology researchers, students, and reference departments of academic, medical, and corporate libraries. This title offers extensive coverage on AIDS and HIV, viral immunology and vaccines, the economic importance and control of virus diseases, and the origin, history, evolution and phylogeny of viruses. It features: four color throughout; sections on future perspectives that show the direction of current research; 25 per cent articles; glossary of key terms for easy referencing; information on viruses of human clinical interest, including the virus causing SARS; more than 20 per cent virus classifications. It offers the most recent information from the 8th International Committee on Taxonomy and Classification of Viruses. It includes recommendations for further reading and a list of other relevant entries.\n\nTitle: Encyclopedia of Virology (3rd ed., Vol. 1-5)\nAuthor: Mahy B., Regenmortel M.\nPublisher: Academic Press\nYear: 2008\nISBN-13: 978-0123739353\nISBN-10: 0123739357\nFormat: PDF\n\nMore info on the book below:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123739357/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0123739357/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
