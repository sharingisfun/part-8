Defoe is notable for being one of the earliest proponents of the novel, as he helped to popularise the form in Britain, and, along with others such as Samuel Richardson, is among the founders of the English novel. A prolific and versatile writer, he wrote more than 500 books, pamphlets and journals on various topics (including politics, crime, religion, marriage, psychology and the supernatural). He was also a pioneer of economic journalism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a273b7e0cb806275d787158026c36f8c8d08398","amp;dn":"Daniel+Defoe+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a273b7e0cb806275d787158026c36f8c8d08398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,39,59,126,12,184,6,39,93,120,113,88,2,108,54,248,200,208,131,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
