Ralph de Bricassart from 1920 to \n\n1962, this two-part miniseries begins in 1943. Father Ralph returns to Drogheda to \n\nevaluate its financial situation just as his one true love, Meggie, is embroiled in \n\na bitter custody battle with her ex-husband, Luke.&quot;\n\n\nI stumbled across this after uploading the four episodes of the 1983 video.\n\nThis is taken from the original novel but left out of the first production.\n\nThis fill-in was made 13 years after the first one. Richard Chamberlain is older.\n\nMeggie is a different actress all-together. \n\nI am entering in my computer after the first four episodes.\n\nI'll watch it later.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f36f25f480ad018d3f530cd1bafee6e4f2ec898","amp;dn":"The+Thorn+Birds+The+Missing+Years+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f36f25f480ad018d3f530cd1bafee6e4f2ec898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,54,242,95,72,10,208,24,211,245,48,205,27,175,238,110,79,46,200,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
