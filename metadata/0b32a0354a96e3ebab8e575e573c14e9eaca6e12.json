By exploring the astonishing and dramatic course of Napoleon's 100 Days - the period during which Napoleon escaped from exile and marched on Paris to conquer Europe once again -- The Emperor Strikes Back opens the essential window that reveals the inside story behind modern history's greatest conqueror. Critical moments from the end of his career - from Napoleon's initial abdication, failed suicide and banishment to his unprecedented return to Imperial glory and his ultimate humiliating defeat - dovetail with flashbacks from throughout his life and military career. The show recreates moments of high-stakes political brinksmanship and flashes of military genius - the legendary turning points that transformed a short and short-tempered artillery officer into a towering giant of history.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b32a0354a96e3ebab8e575e573c14e9eaca6e12","amp;dn":"Icons+of+Power%3A++Napoleon+++%28National+Geographic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b32a0354a96e3ebab8e575e573c14e9eaca6e12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,50,160,53,74,150,227,235,171,142,87,94,87,60,20,233,234,202,110,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
