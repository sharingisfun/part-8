The chapter starts a\nfew seconds before the actual info screen.\n\nThis is certainly one of the most powerful 9/11 documentaries out there.\nAlthough it begins with questions that might appear a bit vague at\nfirst, the narrative eventually gets more &amp; more cogent, especially in\nthe second half which describes the physical evidence regarding the\ncollapse of the Twin Towers as well as Building 7, much of which is\nbased on the research of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth, therefor\ni'd recommend to watch the whole thing before drawing any conclusions.\n\nSee also:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=167&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=167&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ae911truth.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ae911truth.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328bf6b3480660049e3eb09eebf0e54f5531c224","amp;dn":"September+11+-+The+New+Pearl+Harbor+%28x264-vorbis-namedchapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328bf6b3480660049e3eb09eebf0e54f5531c224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,139,246,179,72,6,96,4,158,62,176,158,235,240,229,79,85,49,194,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
