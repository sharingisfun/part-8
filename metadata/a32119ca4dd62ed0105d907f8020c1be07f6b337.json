The emergence of Carrie Brownstein as an equal shareholder in Corin Tucker's vision is the key -- her four contributions (particularly &quot;Stay Where You Are&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone&quot;) are stellar, while her harmonies complete Tucker's equally superb lead turns by reading between the lines to verbalize the naked aggression at the core of the songs' polemic power. Forget the riot grrrl implications inherent in the trio's music -- Call the Doctor is pure, undiluted punk, and it's brilliant.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1996\nLabel: Chainsaw Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4.5 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1. \t&quot;Call the Doctor&quot;   \t        2:30\n2. \t&quot;Hubcap&quot;         \t        2:25\n3. \t&quot;Little Mouth&quot;          \t1:44\n4. \t&quot;Anonymous&quot;      \t        2:29\n5. \t&quot;Stay Where You Are&quot;     \t2:24\n6. \t&quot;Good Things&quot;            \t3:10\n7. \t&quot;I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone&quot;   2:37\n8. \t&quot;Taking Me Home&quot;        \t2:35\n9. \t&quot;Taste Test&quot;             \t3:00\n10. \t&quot;My Stuff&quot;      \t        2:33\n11. \t&quot;I'm Not Waiting&quot;        \t2:21\n12. \t&quot;Heart Attack&quot;           \t2:12\n\nUploaded by politux.
