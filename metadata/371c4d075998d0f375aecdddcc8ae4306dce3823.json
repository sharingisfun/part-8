Also, the general mathematical formulation (for instance, in the BÃƒÂ©nard problem - heated from below) and the effect of free surface deformation are taken into account. In the case of atmospheric thermal convection, the Coriolis force and stratification effects are also considered.\n\nThis volume gives a rational and analytical analysis of the above mentioned physical effects on the basis of the full unsteady Navier-Stokes and Fourier (NS-F) equations - for a Newtonian compressible viscous and heat-conducting fluid - coupled with the associated initials (at initial time), boundary (lower-at the solid plane) and free surface (upper-in contact with ambiant air) conditions. This, obviously, is not an easy but a necessary task if we have in mind a rational modelling process, and work within a numerically coherent simulation on a high speed computer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371c4d075998d0f375aecdddcc8ae4306dce3823","amp;dn":"Convection+in+Fluids+-+A+Rational+Analysis+and+Asymptotic+Modell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371c4d075998d0f375aecdddcc8ae4306dce3823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,28,77,7,89,152,208,243,117,174,205,221,204,138,228,48,109,206,56,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
