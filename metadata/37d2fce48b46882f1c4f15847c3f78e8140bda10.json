Terrorising waters from Australia to the Americas until it became extinct two million years ago, Megalodon made the great white shark look like a small fry.  Not even the giant whales of the time were safe from this apex predator. Now, nearly 2 million years after Megalodon disappeared from earth, scientists will rebuild this monster shark.\n\n\n&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I am only uploading this on Pirate Bay because it's not otherwise available here.
