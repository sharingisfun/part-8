From the looks of things at least four different companies were involved in the process (if not more).\n\nNot sure of the exact year, either, but I think it's safe to assume it was sold at the exhibition, so late 2004, early 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e8dd66677905c8fe69b6d13045da3d9d4076b8","amp;dn":"Miyazaki+%26amp%3B+Moebius+-+Two+Artist%27s+Drawings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e8dd66677905c8fe69b6d13045da3d9d4076b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,232,221,102,103,121,5,200,254,105,182,209,48,69,218,61,157,64,118,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
