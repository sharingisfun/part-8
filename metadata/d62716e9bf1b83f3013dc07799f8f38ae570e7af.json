After releasing his 2011 mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean began writing the album with creative partner Malay, who assisted him with its recording at EastWest Studio in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had on his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon graphemeÃ¢â‚¬â€œcolor synesthesia and the color he perceived during the summer he first fell in love.\n\nChannel Orange has an unconventional musical style, film-inspired segue tracks, and songs that draw on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, and psychedelic music. Ocean's songwriting touches on themes such as unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. His baritone singing on the album exhibits free-form flow and alternating falsetto and tenor registers.\n\nTo prevent it from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. He promoted it with five singles, including his highest charting single &quot;Thinkin Bout You&quot;, and a supporting tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. By February 20, 2013, it had sold 508,200 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album received rave reviews from music critics and was named the best album of the year by numerous publications.\n\nÃ¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”   Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”  Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”  Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”  Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” \nÃ¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”\nÃ¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜     Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜   Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½\nÃ¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜     Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜   Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½  Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”\nÃ¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜  Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€”Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜  Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€˜Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€” Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€“Ë†Ã¢â€¢â€Ã¢â€¢ï¿½\nÃ¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½     Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½  Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½  Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ Ã¢â€¢Å¡Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½Ã¢â€¢ï¿½ \n                                                                            ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62716e9bf1b83f3013dc07799f8f38ae570e7af","amp;dn":"Frank+Ocean+-+2012+-+channel+ORANGE+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62716e9bf1b83f3013dc07799f8f38ae570e7af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,39,22,233,191,27,131,243,1,61,192,119,153,248,243,138,229,112,231,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
