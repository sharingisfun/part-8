The film is told almost exclusively from the point of view of the former, a nerdish British bank clerk named Freddy Clegg (Terence Stamp). A neurotic recluse whose only pleasure is butterfly collecting, Clegg wins $200,000 in the British Football Pool. He purchases a huge country estate, fixes up its cellar with all the comforts of home, then kidnaps Miranda (Samantha Eggar), an art student whom he has worshipped from afar. The demented Clegg doesn't want ransom, nor does he want to rape the girl: he simply wants to &quot;collect&quot; her. She isn't keen on this, and tries several times to escape. After several weeks, Clegg and Miranda grow increasingly fond of one another, and Clegg promises to let her go. When time comes for the actual release, however, Clegg decides that Miranda hasn't completely come around to his way of thinking and changes his mind, leading to a further series of unfortunate events. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Collector.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.32 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 581 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 32593/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate : 1 444 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.267\n      Stream size : 1.20 GiB (91%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 59mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video delay : 6s 715ms\n      Stream size : 109 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.92 \n      Encoding settings : -m s -V 4 -q 0 -lowpass 13.8 -b 128\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059043/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059043/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nWilliam Wyler - The Collector (1965) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9452fbe307e2691c7b0d30b4dcf9f7e90d11a567","amp;dn":"William+Wyler+-+The+Collector+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9452fbe307e2691c7b0d30b4dcf9f7e90d11a567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,82,251,227,7,226,105,28,123,13,48,180,220,249,247,233,13,17,165,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
