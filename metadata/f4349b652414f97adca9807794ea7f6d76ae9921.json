Part of the late 1960s blues rock movement,\n\nSavoy Brown's blues-rock sound takes on a much more defined feel on 1970's Looking In and is one of this band's best efforts. Kim Simmonds is utterly bewildering on guitar, while Lonesome Dave Peverett does a fine job taking over lead singing duties from Chris Youlden who left halfway through the year. \n\nBut it's the captivating arrangements and alluring ease of the music that makes this a superb listen. The pleading strain transformed through Simmonds' guitar on &quot;Money Can't Save Your Soul&quot; is mud-thick with raw blues, and the comfort of &quot;Sunday Night&quot; is extremely smooth and laid back. &quot;Take It Easy&quot; sounds like it could have been a B.B. King tune as it's doused with relaxed guitar fingering. \n\nThe entire album is saturated with a simple, British blues sound but the pace and the marbled strands of bubbly instrumental perkiness fill it with life. Even the Yardbirds-flavored &quot;Leaving Again&quot; is appealing with its naÃƒÂ¯ve hooks, capped off with a heart-stopping guitar solo. This album along with Street Corner Talking best exemplify Savoy Brown's tranquilizing style. \n\n\n1.&quot;Gypsy&quot; (Simmonds)\n2.&quot;Poor Girl&quot; (Stevens)\n3.&quot;Money Can't Save Your Soul&quot; (Peverett, Simmonds)\n4.&quot;Sunday Night&quot; (Simmonds)\n5.&quot;Looking In&quot; (Peverett, Simmonds)\n6.&quot;Take It Easy&quot; (Peverett, Simmonds)\n7.&quot;Sitting an' Thinking&quot; (Simmonds)\n8.&quot;Leavin' Again&quot; (Peverett, Stevens)\n9.&quot;R7manoff&quot; (Simmonds)\n\n\nIf you like the music, buy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4349b652414f97adca9807794ea7f6d76ae9921","amp;dn":"Savoy+Brown+-+Looking+In+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4349b652414f97adca9807794ea7f6d76ae9921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,52,155,101,36,20,249,122,220,169,128,119,148,234,127,109,118,174,153,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
