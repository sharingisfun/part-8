This short course provides an introduction to Maya's MEL (Maya Embedded Language) scripting, which can help speed up repetitive tasks, as well as give you access to features that aren't available through the standard Maya interface. It starts with the basics: using the Script Editor and its output to create custom shelf buttons, or shortcuts, for tools and scripts. Then George moves deeper into MEL's syntax, using custom scripts and a little math to build a staircase generator and, as shown in the final chapter, a simple interface with sliders and buttons.\nTopics include:\n\n    Using the command line and the Script Editor\n    Grabbing Script Editor output\n    Creating, loading, and saving buttons\n    Working with variables and arrays\n    Using conditionals\n    Performing calculations with the math, trig, and time functions\n    Creating and testing a user interface","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b0ec0fed9ff6ddaa93e15b39c0089c4177de2a","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+MEL+Scripting+in+Maya+with+George+Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b0ec0fed9ff6ddaa93e15b39c0089c4177de2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,176,236,15,237,159,246,221,170,147,225,91,57,192,8,156,65,119,222,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
