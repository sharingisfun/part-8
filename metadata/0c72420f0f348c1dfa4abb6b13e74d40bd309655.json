By request, here are is the second batch of songs that have hit the charts since May 6 but have since dropped out (36 in total).  This week itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a healthy debut from Kenny Chesney and Brett Eldredge squeaks in at #30 with his latest single.  All songs are mp3 constant bit rate (CBR) stereo.  Happy Halloween and see you again in two weeks with another new Top 30 U.S. Country singles chart as ranked by Mediabase.\n\n#      ARTIST          TITLE         TIME\n\n01 Jason Aldean - Burnin' It Down (3:35)\n02 Florida Georgia Line - Dirt (3:39)\n03 Sam Hunt - Leave The Night On (Radio Version) (3:06)\n04 Blake Shelton - Neon Light (3:40)\n05 Chase Rice - Ready Set Roll (3:04)\n06 Luke Bryan - Roller Coaster (4:15)\n07 Frankie Ballard - Sunshine &amp; Whiskey (2:59)\n08 Brantley Gilbert, Justin Moore &amp; Thomas Rhett - Small Town Throwdown (3:18)\n09 Miranda Lambert &amp; Carrie Underwood - Somethin' Bad (2:46)\n10 Little Big Town - Day Drinking (2:56)\n11 Keith Urban - Somewhere In My Car (radio edit) (3:12)\n12 Maddie &amp; Tae - Girl In A Country Song (3:35)\n13 Big &amp; Rich - Look At You (3:38)\n14 Parmalee - Close Your Eyes (3:30)\n15 Tim McGraw - Shotgun Rider (3:46)\n16 Brad Paisley - Perfect Storm (3:48)\n17 Scotty McCreery - Feelin' It (3:14)\n18 Carrie Underwood - Something In The Water (3:47)\n19 Chase Bryant - Take It On Back (4:03)\n20 David Nail - Kiss You Tonight (3:45)\n21 Rascal Flatts - Payback (2:57)\n22 Garth Brooks - People Loving People (2:57)\n23 Kenny Chesney - Til It's Gone (4:04)\n24 Swon Brothers - Later On (3:33)\n25 Darius Rucker - Homegrown Honey (3:21)\n26 Dan + Shay - Show You Off (2:59)\n27 Eric Church - Talladega (4:06)\n28 Hunter Hayes - Tattoo (3:13)\n29 Randy Houser - Like A Cowboy (4:14)\n30 Brett Eldredge - Mean To Me (3:45)\n\nNEW RECURRENT Cole Swindell - Hope You Get Lonely Tonight (3:45)\nNEW RECURRENT Dustin Lynch - Where It's At (3:22)\n\nRECURRENT Brett Eldredge - Beat Of The Music (2:55)\nRECURRENT Craig Campbell - Keep Them Kisses Comin' (Hot Radio Mix) (2:37)\nRECURRENT Craig Morgan - Wake Up Lovin' You (3:16)\nRECURRENT Hunter Hayes - Invisible (4:27)\nRECURRENT Justin Moore - Lettin' The Night Roll (3:18)\nRECURRENT Keith Urban - Cop Car (radio edit) (4:08)\nRECURRENT Sara Evans - Slow Me Down (2:55)\nRECURRENT Thomas Rhett - Get Me Some Of That (3:03)\nRECURRENT Billy Currington - We Are Tonight (3:44)\nRECURRENT Blake Shelton &amp; Gwen Sebastian - My Eyes (3:05)\nRECURRENT Brad Paisley - River Bank (2:59)\nRECURRENT Brothers Osborne - Rum (3:21)\nRECURRENT Chris Young - Who Am I With You (3:07)\nRECURRENT Dan + Shay - 19 You + Me (3:33)\nRECURRENT Dierks Bentley - Drunk On A Plane (Yeah Version) (4:07)\nRECURRENT Eli Young Band - Dust (3:16)\nRECURRENT Eric Church - Cold One (3:20)\nRECURRENT Eric Church - Give Me Back My Hometown (4:03)\nRECURRENT Eric Paslay - Song About A Girl (3:43)\nRECURRENT Florida Georgia Line &amp; Luke Bryan - This Is How We Roll (3:39)\nRECURRENT George Strait - I Got A Car [New Radio Edit] (3:45)\nRECURRENT Jake Owen - Beachin' (3:05)\nRECURRENT Jerrod Niemann - Drink To That All Night (3:39)\nRECURRENT Joe Nichols - Yeah (3:43)\nRECURRENT Kenny Chesney - American Kids (3:00)\nRECURRENT Lady Antebellum - Bartender (3:14)\nRECURRENT Lee Brice - I Don't Dance (3:49)\nRECURRENT Luke Bryan - Play It Again (3:38)\nRECURRENT Miranda Lambert - Automatic (4:03)\nRECURRENT Rascal Flatts - Rewind (3:17)\nRECURRENT The Band Perry - Chainsaw (3:43)\nRECURRENT Tim McGraw &amp; Faith Hill - Meanwhile Back At Mama's (3:42)\nRECURRENT Tyler Farr - Whiskey In My Water (2:59)\nRECURRENT Zac Brown Band - All Alright (4:18) \n\nBaz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c72420f0f348c1dfa4abb6b13e74d40bd309655","amp;dn":"Top+30+Country+Oct+21%2C+2014+%2B+recurrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c72420f0f348c1dfa4abb6b13e74d40bd309655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,114,66,15,15,52,140,29,250,74,187,107,19,231,77,64,189,48,150,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
