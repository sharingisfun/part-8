He is director of the Third World Forum in Dakar, Senegal. His numerous works include Eurocentrism: Second Edition, The World We Wish to See, The Liberal Virus, Accumulation on a World Scale, Unequal Development, and Spectres of Capitalism.\n\n===================================================================================\nMost Helpful Customer Review\nSpectres of analysis\nBy Stephanie Budge on August 7, 2000\nFormat: Paperback\nAlthough I enjoyed Amin's book, I was quite frustrated with it. Most of its content deals with questions that go unanswered and many different reasons as to why he wont &quot;go further&quot; into a subject. Although the book contains analysis, it seems to be a review and and explanation of Marx's Communist manifesto. However, despite the lack of analysis, the book contains many significant facts and helps explain Marx's theory and why it applies to the current world.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81836d27c4656eba1b32c1c1970c9596c71055bf","amp;dn":"Samir+Amin+-+Spectres+of+Capitalism.+A+Critique+of+Current+Intel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81836d27c4656eba1b32c1c1970c9596c71055bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,131,109,39,196,101,110,186,27,50,193,193,151,12,149,150,199,16,85,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
