This bundle contains the following novels:\n\nBOOK 1: BLOOD OF REQUIEM -- Requiem, a kingdom of men who could become dragons, lies in ruin. Its destroyer, the tyrant Dies Irae, leads his griffins on a hunt for survivors. Will Requiem's last children perish in the wilderness... or once more become dragons and fly to war\n\nBOOK 2: TEARS OF REQUIEM -- Dies Irae masters new servants: the nightshades, demons of shadow who fear no sword or arrow. They suck the souls from all who live, like a glutton sucking marrow from bones. Can Requiem's last children, a mere scattering of survivors, defeat them\n\nBOOK 3: LIGHT OF REQUIEM -- The world lies in ruin. Forests smolder. The crows feast. From the ashes, Dies Irae raises new soldiers: monsters sewn together from dead body parts. As the undead army marches, Requiem's survivors muster what forces they can... and prepare for the final confrontation with Dies Irae.\n    \nISBN13: 9780987886439\n    ISBN10: 0987886436\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b1a5cb2805ae928473aa095bd9450e2fbf2247f","amp;dn":"Daniel+Arenson%2C+Song+of+Dragons%2C+The+Complete+Trilogy+epub+%5Bdova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b1a5cb2805ae928473aa095bd9450e2fbf2247f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,26,92,178,128,90,233,40,71,58,160,149,189,148,80,226,251,242,36,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
