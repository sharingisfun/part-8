Yet Schrodinger's scientific discoveries only scratch the surface of what makes him so fascinating. More rumpled than Einstein, a devotee of eastern religion and philosophy, and infamous for his alternative lifestyle, his major contribution to physics--and the work for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1933--was to some extent a disappointment to him. Regardless, Schrodinger's masterpiece became an important part of the new physics of his time. This book tells the story of Schrodinger's surprisingly colorful life during one of the most fertile and creative moments in the history of science.\n \nThe first accessible, in-depth biography of the Nobel Prize-winning Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger.\n\n\n2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec559fd2651a508221b5b63a58f693ca26e2d5e","amp;dn":"Erwin+Schr%26ouml%3Bdinger+and+the+Quantum+Revolution+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec559fd2651a508221b5b63a58f693ca26e2d5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,197,89,253,38,81,165,8,34,27,91,99,165,143,105,60,162,110,45,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
