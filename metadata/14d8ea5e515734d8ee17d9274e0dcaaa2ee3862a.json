On June 4, 2008, Arias stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times, slit his throat and shot him in the head in what prosecutors said was jealous rage, and what Arias unpersuasively argued was self-defense, when, according to her, he attacked her. \n\nBut you know all that. \n\nDirty Little Secret unearths no secrets, dirty or otherwise. Every sordid detail, it seems, has been trumpeted for years by the media, then recycled for months during Arias' trial in Phoenix that got blanket coverage on TV and in particular on cable's HLN, vaulting that network to record ratings. \n\n\n\nCast: \n\nTania Raymonde ... Jodi Arias\n\nJesse Lee Soffer ... Travis Alexander \n\nTony Plana ..Prosecutor Juan Martinez \n\nDavid Zayas ...
