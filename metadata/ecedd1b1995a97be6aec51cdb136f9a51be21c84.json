It is pretty funny...for some!\n\nI sent it again, since I sent the torrent last time, before both my comps died...but nobody seems to have the whole thing...except me. I had it on a dvd, as .avi. So here it is, a fresh copy. Enjoy.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecedd1b1995a97be6aec51cdb136f9a51be21c84","amp;dn":"Night+of+the+day+of+the+dawn+of+the+son+of+the+bride+of+the+retu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecedd1b1995a97be6aec51cdb136f9a51be21c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,237,209,177,153,90,151,190,106,236,81,205,177,54,249,165,27,226,28,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
