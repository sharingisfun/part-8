This set differs from her previous efforts in that there is absolutely no rap to be found anywhere on the disc, and all of the songs are slow-burning, midtempo alt-rock numbers, as opposed to anything remotely resembling dance or rap (though there are some hip-hop styled beats). There are really no immediate hits on this album, although it includes the international chart-topping duet with Youssou N'Dour, &quot;7 Seconds,&quot; as well as several other highlights, including &quot;Woman,&quot; &quot;Hornbeam,&quot; and &quot;Everything.&quot; Also included here is a tribute cover she recorded of Marvin Gaye's &quot;Trouble Man.&quot; The album is a high-quality collection of alt-rock womens' anthems, at times bluesy, at times folksy, and much more akin to her previous rock-leaning effort Homebrew than her breakthrough Raw Like Sushi. The songs have an organic, earthy feel, in tune with the Lilith Fair alternative-style musical movement going on at the time. A good deal of alterna-sexual references are found, especially considering some of the song titles (first single &quot;Kootchi&quot; and &quot;Beastiality,&quot; to mention two). A solid album, but definitely not very commercial. Still, it should have been given a chance in the U.S. market, especially given her previous track record.\nAll Music Review by Jose F.
