For a monthly fee, users can upgrade to a &quot;Premium&quot; account, which offers higher bitrate streams, offline access to music and use of Spotify on mobile devices running iOS, Android or Symbian.[7] Currently only consumers with a Paypal account or a credit card issued in one of the launch countries can activate a Premium account. A &quot;Day Pass&quot; was available, which gave unlimited advert-free listening for 24 hours; this option was removed when Spotify &quot;Unlimited&quot; was introduced in May 2010.\nMusic can be browsed by artist, album, record label or playlist as well as by direct searches, and a link allows the listener to purchase selected material via partner retailers.[8] Launched in October 2008, Spotify has approximately seven million users as of May 19th, 2010; about 250,000 of these are paying members.[9]\n\n\nSeed!\n\n___________________________________UPDATE___________________________________________\n|                                                                                  |\n|                                                                                  |\n|  plz leave a comment if you got a problem - /Free Musik 2 All                                                                                |\n|__________________________________________________________________________________|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e033fcbe231cfe00a1be09fdef838119eab1e98","amp;dn":"Spotify+2.0.1+-+The+New+Vesion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e033fcbe231cfe00a1be09fdef838119eab1e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,3,63,203,226,49,207,224,10,27,224,159,222,248,56,17,158,171,30,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
