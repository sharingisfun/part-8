In more than 480 entries, paranormal expert Guiley covers both historical witchcraft, such as the Salem witches,Santa Fe witches, and Stamford witches of the seventeenth century, and contemporary issues and concerns. Topics such as different types of witchcraft, fairies, folk magic, the occult, pagan practices, voodoo or vodun, spells, demons, charms, and magic circles are clearly defined. Descriptions of beliefs, and rituals connected to witchcraft, and biographies of individuals, both historical and fictional, living and dead (for example, Aleister Crowley, Morgan le Fay, Margaret Alice Murray, and Starhawk), are included. In addition to updates of contemporary biographies, this edition contains new Wicca-related material, as indicated by the addition of the word Wicca to the title. Short lists of further reading, a number of them updated, follow many of the entries. The lengthy bibliography has been expanded and updated as well. Offering a broader perspective than many arcane resources on this popular subject, this volume is suited to casual readers and researchers. --Susan Awe --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 436 pages\n    * Publisher: Checkmark Books; 3rd edition (September 2008)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0816071047\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0816071043","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d21c3f56e9bf99cafe845d2d46464c2f5f7d403","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Witches%2CWitchcraft+and+Wicca%2C3rd+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d21c3f56e9bf99cafe845d2d46464c2f5f7d403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,33,195,245,110,155,249,156,175,232,69,210,212,100,100,194,245,247,212,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
