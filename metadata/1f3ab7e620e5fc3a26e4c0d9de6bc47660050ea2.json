Spanning over three decades, their repertoire has included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock.\nThe group had its early origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in 1969 (without a record deal) as &quot;Pointers, a Pair&quot;. The line-up grew to a quartet when Anita Pointer joined, followed by Ruth, who joined in December, 1972, right before they recorded their debut album.\nThey achieved their greatest commercial success later as a trio consisting of Anita, June, and Ruth, after Bonnie left the group to commence a solo career in 1978. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pointer_Sisters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pointer_Sisters&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Pointer Sisters - The Best Of The Pointer Sisters\nThis compilation 1989\nLabel RCA\nCompany BMG\n\n01  The Pointer Sisters - Jump\n02  The Pointer Sisters - Someday We'll Be Together\n03  The Pointer Sisters - Automatic\n04  The Pointer Sisters - He's So Shy\n05  The Pointer Sisters - Should I Do It\n06  The Pointer Sisters - Slow Hand\n07  The Pointer Sisters - Heart To Heart Talk\n08  The Pointer Sisters - Telegraph Your Love\n09  The Pointer Sisters - Overnight Success (Anita Pointer)\n10  The Pointer Sisters - Fire\n11  The Pointer Sisters - I'm So Excited\n12  The Pointer Sisters - Goldmine\n13  The Pointer Sisters - Back In My Arms\n14  The Pointer Sisters - I Need You\n15  The Pointer Sisters - Neutron Dance\n16  The Pointer Sisters - Dare Me\n17  The Pointer Sisters - See How The Love Goes\n18  The Pointer Sisters - I'm Ready For Love (June Pointer)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-pointer-sisters-rca-1989-r46876&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-pointer-sisters-rca-1989-r46876&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3ab7e620e5fc3a26e4c0d9de6bc47660050ea2","amp;dn":"Pointer+Sisters+-+The+Best+Of++%281989%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3ab7e620e5fc3a26e4c0d9de6bc47660050ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,58,183,230,32,229,252,58,38,228,192,217,222,107,196,118,96,5,14,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
