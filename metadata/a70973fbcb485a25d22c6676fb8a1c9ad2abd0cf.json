It was at first just a personal tool/toy. But over time Damn Small Linux grew into a community project with hundreds of development hours put into refinements including a fully automated remote and local application installation system and a very versatile backup and restore system which may be used with any writable media including a hard drive, a floppy drive, or a USB device.\n\n\ntake the _ out use these trackers\n\nht_tp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce\n\nht_tp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce\n\nht_tp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nht_tp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce\n\nht_tp://linuxtracker.org:2710/00000000000000000000000000000000/announce\n\nht_tp://wolf687.homeip.net:44700/announce\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a70973fbcb485a25d22c6676fb8a1c9ad2abd0cf","amp;dn":"Damn+Small+Linux+4.4.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a70973fbcb485a25d22c6676fb8a1c9ad2abd0cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,9,115,251,203,72,90,37,210,44,102,118,251,138,28,154,210,171,208,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
