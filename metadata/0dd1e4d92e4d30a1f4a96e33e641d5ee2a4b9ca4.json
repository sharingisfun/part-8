This is a WineSkin Port. I am not a porting professional so do not expect this to be a perfect port. There may be some bugs but the game is, overall, playable.\r\n\r\n2. This is a reupload of a port I made a couple of years back. This now works with the latest version of OS X El Capitan.\r\n\r\n3. I haven't finished testing this yet as I was too busy to finish the Chaos campaign but so far everything works great and I have yet to experience a game-breaking bug.\r\n\r\n4.
