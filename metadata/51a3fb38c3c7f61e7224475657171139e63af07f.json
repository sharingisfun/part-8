It was recorded live in England for the MTV Unplugged series and includes both the hit single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and a heavily reworked acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot;.\n\nClapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus Left Town&quot; along with &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot; and an impromptu version of &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin'&quot;. Clapton played a Martin 000-42 acoustic guitar for much of this performance, and in 2004, the guitar sold for US$791,500 (Ã‚Â£434,400) in auction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51a3fb38c3c7f61e7224475657171139e63af07f","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Unplugged+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51a3fb38c3c7f61e7224475657171139e63af07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,163,251,56,195,199,246,30,114,36,71,86,87,23,17,57,230,58,240,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
