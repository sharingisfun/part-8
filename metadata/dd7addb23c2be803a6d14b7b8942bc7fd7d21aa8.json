An official estimate states that 254 Hindus and more than 790 Muslims were killed during the riots, with 223 more missing. The documentary consists mostly of interviews, with both Muslims and Hindus, of multiple generations, and both sexes, with different views regarding the causes, justifications, and the actual events of the violence that occurred, as well as their prospects for the future. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBangkok International Film Festival 2005\nWon\nSpecial Mention\t Best Documentary\nRakesh Sharma \n\n\nBerlin International Film Festival 2004\nWon\nNetpac Award - Special Mention\t\nRakesh Sharma \n\nWon\nWolfgang Staudte Award\t\nRakesh Sharma \n\n\nHong Kong International Film Festival 2004\n2nd place\nHumanitarian Award (Documentary)\t\nRakesh Sharma \n\n\nYamagata International Documentary Festival 2005\nNominated\nRobert and Frances Flaherty Prize\t\nRakesh Sharma \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7addb23c2be803a6d14b7b8942bc7fd7d21aa8","amp;dn":"Final+Solution+%282003%2C2004%29+%5BBANNED+-+Indian+Documentary+on+Gujar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7addb23c2be803a6d14b7b8942bc7fd7d21aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,122,221,178,60,43,232,3,166,209,75,123,137,66,188,127,215,210,26,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
