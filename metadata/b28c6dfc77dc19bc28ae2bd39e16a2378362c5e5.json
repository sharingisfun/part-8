Literally. And how was she to know that there was more than one type of demon? The Evils want to destroy her soul, while billionaire Sentinel demon, Zachary Winston, claims that he wants to protect her. Kat opts for ZachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protectionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come without a price. It requires a demon bargainÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and what he suggests surprises poor Kat almost as much as the fact that demons really do exist. Why would the handsome billionaire want to make such an agreement with an curvy, plain redheaded woman like her?\n\nBillionaire Zachary Winston has a mission and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one that he vows to complete. As a Sentinel demon, his task is to protect Kat from the Evils that will corrupt her soul. His only problem is that she is his Ã¢â‚¬Å“radiant,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the one woman who can lighten the darkness of his demon existence and be his eternal mate. Zach has to fight an internal war between man and demon as he protects Kat, not quite sure which one will win. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one part demon, one part man, but they both yearn for KatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lush, full figured body and kind, compassionate heart. As Zach becomes more and more enchanted with Kat, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hoping she can learn to love a lonely man/demon thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only slightly wicked.\n\nThis paranormal romance contains graphic language, steamy love scenes, and lovable alpha males that also happen to be mythological demons.\n\nBook 2:\n\nDr. Talia Maris had lived her entire life as a freakÃ¢â‚¬â€a too tall, too plain, too odd woman who sees and senses the presence of otherworldly entities. A total recluse, Talia spends all of her time on her research, living a contented, quiet life with only her loyal feline companion for company. Until that sedate existence comes crashing down around her when she starts being pursued by demon Evils. And if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing she hatesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demons. She ditches every one of them until Sentinel demon, Drew Winston, finally wins the game of pursuit by trapping her with a deceitful, underhanded trick. Not only is she infuriated by DrewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunt, but when he tells her sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his mate, Talia wonders if the too handsome, too tall, too sexy Sentinel demon needs some serious psychological help. All she wants is to get rid of Drew as quickly as possible! But the stubborn Irishman isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t budging, and her resistance slowly crumbles as she gets pulled deeper and deeper into the world of the Sentinels by the relentless attempts of the Evils to capture her. And what is she supposed to do with Drew Winston, a Sentinel demon who would do anything, even sacrificing his own life, to protect her?\n\nThere are two things Drew Winston loves about his life: being a billionaire Sentinel demon and food. He loves having everything he wants, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfectly happy slaying Evils and rescuing unsuspecting humans, until the irritating Dr. Talia Maris evades him one time too many. YeahÃ¢â‚¬Â¦sureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦maybe he was a little devious in the method he used to finally meet her face-to-face, but he ends up being the one who is actually surprised when he discovers the elusive woman is actually his mate. Worse yet, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being pursued by ancient Evils, and it brings every protective instinct he has to the surface, making him want to kill anything that might hurt Talia. Maybe Drew had never wanted or expected a mate of his own, but once he has Talia in his grasp, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to keep her safe and make her want to stay with him forever.\n\n18+ Plus Only.
