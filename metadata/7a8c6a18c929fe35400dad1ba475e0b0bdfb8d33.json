Includes the hard to find a good HQ copy of &quot;Struggle&quot; plus a few other releases not found in other (crappy inconsistent bit-rate) torrents. This is all 320, properly tagged, with 500x500 art.\n\nStudio albums\n1. Struggle*\n2. Statement\n3. Development\n4. Recoil\n5. To The Pain\n6. Vengeance\n7. Miracle\n\nEP\n8. Cut The Cord\n\nLive\n9.Live &amp; Kicking\n\nCompilation\n10. Icon\n\n\n*Note1: AKA Separate Yourself: The Beginning. These two are identical, Struggle is the original name, while the other is the 2002 reissue.\n\nIcon contains 1 new track, Evil Ways, only previously available on a sampler sold by independent record stores. The only track missing from here is the Live version of &quot;What A Day&quot; from the aforementioned sampler, which contained only 3 tracks. X-Today Theme was also on the sampler and is here, it was a bonus track on the Japanese issue of Statement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a8c6a18c929fe35400dad1ba475e0b0bdfb8d33","amp;dn":"Nonpoint+Discog+%5B320%5D+%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a8c6a18c929fe35400dad1ba475e0b0bdfb8d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,140,106,24,201,41,254,53,64,13,173,27,164,117,224,176,189,251,141,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
