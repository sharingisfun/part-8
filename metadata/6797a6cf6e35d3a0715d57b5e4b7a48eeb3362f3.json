This ambitious project blends science with innovative visual effects and compelling personal stories, and addresses some big questions. By understanding the human brain, we can come close to understanding humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  What is Reality \r\nDr. Eagleman takes viewers on an extraordinary journey that explores how the brain, locked in silence and darkness without direct access to the world, conjures up the rich and beautiful world we all take for granted.\r\n\r\n2)  What Makes Me \r\nEpisode two, 'What Makes Me?', explores the question of how the brain gives rise to our thoughts, emotions, our memories and personality. Philosophers and great thinkers have for millennia pondered the question of how physical stuff can give rise to mental processes. Last century, the new field of neuroscience joined the discussion, and Dr David Eagleman explains that to a neuroscientist, the answers to such questions lie in a deep understanding of the brain.\r\n\r\n3)  Who is in Control \r\n'Who Is in Control?' explores the great deception that greets us each morning when we awake: it feels as though we are in conscious control of our lives but the truth is that we are not. Instead almost every action, every decision, every belief that we hold is driven by parts of the brain that we have no access to.\r\n\r\n4)  How Do I Decide \r\nThe human brain is the most complex object we've discovered in the universe, and every day much of its neural circuitry is taken up with the tens of thousands of decisions we need to make. 'How do I decide?' is a journey through the unseen world of decisions, and how they get made.\r\n\r\n5)  Why Do I Need You \r\nIn 'Why Do I Need You?' Dr. David Eagleman explores how the human brain relies on other brains to thrive and survive. This neural interdependence begins at birth. Dr. David Eagleman invites a group of babies to a puppet show to showcase their ability to discern who is trustworthy, and who isn't.\r\n\r\n6)  Who Will We be \r\nIn 'Who will we be?' Dr. David Eagleman journeys into the future, and asks what's next for the human brain, and for our species. Mother nature has evolved a brain that is eminently flexible, able to rewire itself according to whatever environment it finds itself in, which means that as technological advances continue apace, our technology is on a crash course with our biology.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen1.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen2.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen3.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen4.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen5.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen6.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen7.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen8.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen9.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen10.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen11.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen12.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen13.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bf/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen14.jpg  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/The-Brain-with-David-Eagleman-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: ~1900 Kbps (CRF 21)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC (Nero)\r\n * Audio Quality: 0.48 48KHz (~140 Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 55mn (each)\r\n * Part Size: ~800 MiB\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container: MP4\r\n * Released: 2015\r\n * Source: HDTV AVC 1080i\r\n * Encoder: KarMa\r\n * Merged Subtitles: English\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.pbs.org/the-brain-with-david-eagleman/episodes/\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Brain%3A%20Our%20Universe%20Within\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Meet%20Your%20Brain\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=My%20Brilliant%20Brain\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Is%20your%20Brain%20Male%20or%20Female\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Secret%20Life%20of%20the%20Brain\r\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Brain%20-%20A%20Secret%20History\r\n\r\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Brain_with_David_Eagleman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6797a6cf6e35d3a0715d57b5e4b7a48eeb3362f3","amp;dn":"PBS.The.Brain.with.David.Eagleman.4of6.How.Do.I.Decide.720p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6797a6cf6e35d3a0715d57b5e4b7a48eeb3362f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,151,166,207,110,53,211,160,113,93,87,181,228,183,164,142,235,51,98,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
