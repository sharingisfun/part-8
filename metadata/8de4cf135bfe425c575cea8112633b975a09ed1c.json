All songs are tagged by the book.\n\n\nReview by Frank John Hadley\nPonder is an undervalued modern jazz guitarist who has command over all the nuances and shadings of blues. This 1990 session is festooned with intelligent and decidedly bluesy contributions from saxophonist Houston Person, organist Lonnie Smith, and drummer Winard Harper. The ten-minute title track is a Vesuvius of Hammond lava, molten guitar bends, spewed tenor ash, and hot percussion magma.\n\n----------\n\nIf you encounter errors during the file sharing, please, place this material as close to the root of the hard disk as possible and restart the file sharing (e.g. as close as possible to C: in Windows).
