It was released on May 14, 2002, nearly a year to the day after their previous album was released, and was the first Weezer album to stray from the 10 song per album &quot;tradition&quot;. Maladroit features heavy metal riffs, uncommon to Weezer&amp;#039;s previous releases.\n\nTrack listing\n\n\n   1. &quot;American Gigolo&quot; ? 2:42\n   2. &quot;Dope Nose&quot; ? 2:17\n   3. &quot;Keep Fishin&amp;#039;&quot; ? 2:52\n   4. &quot;Take Control&quot; ? 3:05\n   5. &quot;Death and Destruction&quot; ? 2:38\n   6. &quot;Slob&quot; ? 3:09\n   7. &quot;Burndt Jamb&quot; ? 2:39\n   8. &quot;Space Rock&quot; ? 1:53\n   9. &quot;Slave&quot; ? 2:53\n  10. &quot;Fall Together&quot; ? 2:02\n  11. &quot;Possibilities&quot; ? 2:00\n  12. &quot;Love Explosion&quot; ? 2:35\n  13. &quot;December&quot; ? 2:59\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392e1c91d3b204e4c42ab3c72c0af918645a5e63","amp;dn":"Weezer+-+Maladroit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392e1c91d3b204e4c42ab3c72c0af918645a5e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,46,28,145,211,178,4,228,196,42,179,199,44,10,249,24,100,90,94,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
