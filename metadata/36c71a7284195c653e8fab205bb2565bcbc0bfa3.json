Parrish\nPublished: Oct 2004\nPublisher: Our Noir\nFormat: Epub (Retail)\nLanguage: English\nGenres: Fiction, Mystery, Suspense\n\nAfter a hurricane whips into Florida, Private Investigator Louis Kincaid finds a baby's skull on the debris-filled beach. Deeply disturbed by his discovery, he begins research into identifying the child. He is also hired by a local woman to watch her father, whose behavior has been peculiar, and the police force has already taken Kincaid on to help solve a murder. Eventually, the plots converge, and the ending has surprises right up to the last page. Although the fifth in the series, this novel stands on its own. Set in the islands west of Fort Myers, it brings the heat, humidity, and insect life of the sand-and-shell environment to life. Although it deals with events dating to the early days of the Spanish settlement of Florida, the story takes place in 1987. Kincaid continues his efforts at self-definition even as he buries himself in his work. A complex personÃ¢â‚¬â€œyoung, African American, bright, and good at his jobÃ¢â‚¬â€œhe is haunted by an event in his past. Mel Landeta, his police partner, is experienced, white, and losing his eyesight. He provides the expertise Kincaid needs to refine his investigating skills, and, after much bickering, they become a working team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c71a7284195c653e8fab205bb2565bcbc0bfa3","amp;dn":"Island+of+Bones+by+P.J.+Parrish+%28Request%29+%28Epub%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c71a7284195c653e8fab205bb2565bcbc0bfa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,199,26,114,132,25,92,101,62,143,171,32,91,178,86,91,203,192,191,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
