It's also the oldest, with a history dating back to 1904. Our long experience makes our boat tests the most authoritative in the business and means our technical coverage is without equal. Each month we cover the best new boats on the market, cruising areas that are both practical and inspirational, and the latest boating developments and training. Core editorial focuses on boats up to 80ft, but we also venture beyond the 80ft barrier in our monthly Custom Yachting pages.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a45bf378369b75dd949dd0325800a1d410594b7","amp;dn":"Motor+Boat+%26amp%3B+Yachting+-+April+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a45bf378369b75dd949dd0325800a1d410594b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,69,191,55,131,105,183,93,217,73,221,3,37,128,10,29,65,5,148,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
