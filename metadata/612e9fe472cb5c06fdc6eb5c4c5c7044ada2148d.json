A great cast helps too, and a lot of supporting actors appearing in The Scar have significant roles in other noirs.\n\nThere's nothing &quot;noir&quot; missing from this movie except perhaps a femme fatale: in contrast to her role in, say, Scarlett Street, Joan Bennett plays here the &quot;good girl&quot;, albeit a somewhat cynical one.\n\nThe only real weakness that occurs to me about this noir is that the cast frequently overacts, but that is &quot;in style&quot; for noir.\n\n****************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can. Thank you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612e9fe472cb5c06fdc6eb5c4c5c7044ada2148d","amp;dn":"The+Scar+%281948+film+noir%2C+aka+Hollow+Triumph%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612e9fe472cb5c06fdc6eb5c4c5c7044ada2148d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,46,159,228,114,203,92,6,253,198,235,92,76,92,112,68,173,162,20,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
