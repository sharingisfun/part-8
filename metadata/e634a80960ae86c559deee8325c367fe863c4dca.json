As her organs failed, she entered into an extraordinary near-death experience where she realized her inherent worth . . . and the actual cause of her disease. Upon regaining consciousness, Anita found that her condition had improved so rapidly that she was able to be released from the hospital within weeks . . . without a trace of cancer in her body!\n\nWithin these pages, Anita recounts stories of her childhood in Hong Kong, her challenge to establish her career and find true love, as well as how she eventually ended up in that hospital bed where she defied all medical knowledge.\n\nAs part of a traditional Hindu family residing in a largely Chinese and British society, she had been pushed and pulled by cultural and religious customs since she had been a little girl. After years of struggling to forge her own path while trying to meet everyone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations, she had the realization, as a result of her epiphany on the other side, that she had the power to heal herself . . . and that there are miracles in the Universe that she had never even imagined. \n\nIn Dying to Be Me, Anita freely shares all she has learned about illness, healing, fear, Ã¢â‚¬Å“being love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the true magnificence of each and every human being!\n\nThis is a book that definitely makes the case that we are spiritual beings having a human experience . . . and that we are all One!\n\n\nNOTES: \n\nI was looking for this and there were EPUBs/MOBI already available, however those were entirely screwed up and un-readable.\n\nI took the PDF and converted it and made *proper* ebooks from this.
