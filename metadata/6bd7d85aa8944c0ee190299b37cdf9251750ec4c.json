Audience response was so overwhelming that SNL producer Lorne\nMichaels decided to go ahead with a full production, All You Need Is Cash,\nwhich originally aired on NBC-TV in the spring of 1978 - six years before the\nmore famous &quot;mockumentary,&quot; Spinal Tap. The extravaganza starred Idle and Neil\nInnes (the latter of whom wrote all of the music) and featured special guests\nMick Jagger, Ron Wood, Paul Simon, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner,\nBill Murray, and even ex-Beatle George Harrison.\n\n  Follow four mop-topped young Brits whose right choice of trousers (tight)\ngets them a lifetime recording contract despite their lack of musical ability.\nOvercoming that, they produce monumental albums like Sgt. Rutter&amp;#039;s Only Darts\nClub Band, which, along with appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and a concert\nat Che Stadium, cement their world domination of pop music. But, as with their\nFab Four namesake, artistic differences and various other problems threaten to\nderail Rutlemania. Don&amp;#039;t miss The Rutles&amp;#039; wonderfully warped songs &quot;Hold My\nHand,&quot; &quot;Love Life,&quot; &quot;Ouch!,&quot; &quot;Piggy In The Middle,&quot; &quot;Cheese And Onions,&quot; &quot;Get\nUp And Go,&quot; and many other familiar-sounding tunes. \n\n The DVD version includes director&amp;#039;s commentary and introduction with Eric\nIdle, an interactive photo gallery, animated menus, enhanced 5.1 audio, and\nalternate scenes from the U.K. version of the film!\n\n\n                                    CAST:\n\nEric Idle        ...
