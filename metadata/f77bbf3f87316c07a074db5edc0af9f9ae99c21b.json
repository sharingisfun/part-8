Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those '80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera's mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new\nalbum debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, &quot;I'm Broken,&quot; was getting massive airplay. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.81% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalogue:\t\t8122-73734-2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n01.Cowboys From Hell\n02.Domination\n03.Cemetery Gates\n04.Mouth For War\n05.Walk\n06.This Love\n07.Fucking Hostile\n08.Becoming\n09.I'm Broken\n10.5 Minutes Alone\n11.Planet Caravan\n12.Drag The Waters\n13.Where You Come From\n14.Revolution Is My Name\n15.Immortally Insane\n16.The Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77bbf3f87316c07a074db5edc0af9f9ae99c21b","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+Reinventing+Hell+The+Best+Of+Pantera+%282003%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77bbf3f87316c07a074db5edc0af9f9ae99c21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,123,191,63,135,49,108,7,160,116,219,94,220,10,249,249,174,153,194,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
