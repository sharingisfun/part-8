This is a new HQ format, which brought stunning video quality but it probably won't be played on your old smart TV or BluRay Player. Though I played it fine with MX player on my android device.\n\nIf you want to play it on your PC, you can easily use VLC, MPC-HC, GOM Player or any other modern media player. just be sure you got the latest version of them.\nIf you have no video and only the audio is playing, try to update your player or use another one. Installing LAV Filters may help.\n\n\nIf you want to read more about the format, check this out:\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11022227/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is nothing you can compare with x264 releases so don't let the size scare you. small sizes don't always mean LOW QUALITIES. This is the best you can get in this size.\n\nCheck screenshots or the sample (if there's any) then download it and Enjoy. You'll LOVE IT!\n\nThis is THE future!\n\n\n\n** Special thanks to all the seeders. you are all part of this :) **\n\n\n\nScreenshots:\nN/A\n\nSAMPLE INCLUDED\n\n\nWhat you should do when you're downloading a dead(0seeder) torrent?\n- Check our blog to see if it's available online:\n- Google it! there's so many sites uploading our releases \n- Comment on my latest release and ask me to seed it (if it's possible I will seed it for few more hours after I see the comment)\n\nOur Torrent(direct .torrent file) RSS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=38575&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=38575&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOur onlineRSS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=36171&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.webrss.com/createfeed.php?feedid=36171&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f6196b032e33685a20c19afdf393b2551f3b15","amp;dn":"Arrow.S03E08.720p.WEB-DL.2CH.x265.HEVC-PSA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f6196b032e33685a20c19afdf393b2551f3b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,246,25,107,3,46,51,104,90,32,193,154,253,243,147,178,85,31,59,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
