They are known for their extremely high-powered, driving guitar sound, mixed with blues-rock influences and are therefore sometimes compared to MotÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶rhead.[1][2] Zeke released their first single, West Seattle Acid Party, in 1993; after several album releases on indie label Scooch Pooch Records, they signed with Epitaph in 1998 which led to nationwide fame in punk rock circles. They are currently signed to Relapse Records.\n\nThe song \\&quot;Death Alley\\&quot; was on Tony Hawk\\&amp;#039;s Pro Skater 4, the song \\&quot;Long Train Runnin\\&amp;#039;\\&quot; appeared on Tony Hawk\\&amp;#039;s Underground 2, and \\&quot;Kill the King\\&quot; recently appeared on Tony Hawk\\&amp;#039;s Project 8.\n\n\n\n--- If you like this music - Please buy the CD albums and support this artist ---\n\n\n==========*****=&lt;&gt; FODUM - Foda e nao estar aqui! &lt;&gt;*****==========\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fodum.com.br/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fodum.com.br/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVisite, cadastre-se e participe de nosso forum","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec08858b9e216237a10db0bcc5b3b9a58e9aee94","amp;dn":"Zeke+Discography+-+12CD+-+MP3+128%40+-+FODUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec08858b9e216237a10db0bcc5b3b9a58e9aee94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,8,133,139,158,33,98,55,161,13,176,188,197,179,185,165,142,154,238,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
