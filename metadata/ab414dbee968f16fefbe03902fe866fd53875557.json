Created by Senior Sergeant Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first adopted by the USSR soon after World War II (1939-1945), its production continues to this day, with an estimated 75 million produced worldwide. It is the longest serving post-World War II military weapon and its ease of use, durability and low production costs ensure that its use will continue for generations to come.\n\nThis book takes a look at the complete history of the weapon, discussing its design, development, and usage, taking its story from the great armies of the Soviet Union to the insurgents and criminal gangs that often employ the weapon today.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-AK-47-Kalashnikov--assault-rifles/dp/1849084610/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332768838&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-AK-47-Kalashnikov--assault-rifles/dp/1849084610/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332768838&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab414dbee968f16fefbe03902fe866fd53875557","amp;dn":"The+AK-47%3A+Kalashnikov-series+assault+rifles+%28Osprey+Weapon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab414dbee968f16fefbe03902fe866fd53875557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,65,77,190,233,104,241,111,239,190,3,144,47,232,102,253,83,135,85,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
