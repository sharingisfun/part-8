This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n\n\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov (Russian: Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€˜Ã…â€™Ãƒâ€˜Ã‚ï¿½ Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â°Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â·Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¾Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€˜Ã¢â‚¬Â¹) is the final novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, and is generally considered the culmination of his life's work.
