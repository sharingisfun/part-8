He stood at the head of the first Coalition government in 65 years, with the country in dire economic straits following a deep financial crisis.\r\n\r\nFrom the early heady days of the Rose Garden partnership with the Liberal Democrats to the most bitterly contested general election in years, â€˜Cameron at 10â€™ highlights forty dramatic moments in an exceptionally turbulent period in British politics. The book contains all the highs and lows on the domestic front as well as providing revealing insights into the Prime Ministerâ€™s relationships with foreign leaders, particularly the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nWith unprecedented access to the â€˜inner circleâ€™ of politicians and civil servants that surround the Prime Minister, from Chancellor George Osborne and former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to all of Cameronâ€™s personal team, this is the most intimate account of a serving prime minister that has ever been published","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cfa3a2fb7da797f99a1fe834bf707f104f77a5","amp;dn":"Cameron+at+10+-+The+Inside+Story+2010-2015+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cfa3a2fb7da797f99a1fe834bf707f104f77a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,207,163,162,251,125,167,151,249,154,31,232,52,191,112,127,16,79,119,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
