Who is in Coma Suite Number 5? A matchless lover? A supreme egotist? A selfless martyr? A bad mother? A cherished sister? A selfish wife? All of these. For this is Silvia Shute who has always done exactly what she wants. Until now, when her life suddenly, shockingly stops. Her past holds a dark and terrible secret, and now that she is unconscious in a hospital bed, her constant stream of visitors are set to uncover the mystery of her broken life. And she must lie there, victim of the beloveds, the borings, the babblings and the plain bonkers. Like it or not, the truth is about to pay Silvia a visit. Again, and again and again... Oh Dear Silvia is the brand new novel from one of Britain's most loved comic writers and the number one bestselling author of A Tiny Bit Marvellous. Praise for Dawn French: 'Extremely funny' Sunday Times 'A fantastic slam-dunk pageturner' Mail on Sunday Dawn French has been making people laugh for thirty years. On purpose. As a writer, comedian and actor, she has appeared in some of this country's most long running, cherished and celebrated shows, including French and Saunders, The Comic Strip Presents. . ., Murder Most Horrid, The Vicar of Dibley, Jam and Jerusalem, Lark Rise to Candleford, and more recently, Roger and Val Have Just Got In. Her bestselling memoir, Dear Fatty, was published to critical acclaim in 2008. Her first novel, A Tiny Bit Marvellous, was also a great success, going straight to No.1.\n.\n.\nA Tiny Bit Marvellous - ePub, Mobi\nEveryone hates the perfect family. So youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love the Battles. Mo is about to hit the big 50, and some uncomfortable truths are becoming quite apparent: She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand either of her teenage kids, which as a child psychologist, is fairly embarrassing. She has become entirely grey. Inside, and out. Her face has surrendered and is frightening children. Dora is about to hit the big 18 . . . and about to hit anyone who annoys her, especially her precocious younger brother Peter who has a chronic Oscar Wilde fixation. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dad . . . whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just, well, dad. A TINY BIT MARVELLOUS is the story of a modern family all living in their own separate bubbles lurching towards meltdown. It is for anyone who has ever shared a home with that weird group of strangers we call relations. Oh and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dog. Called Poo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc7eea7fbc566217f00419abcc17d2b9dbea3b3","amp;dn":"Dawn+French+-+Oh+Dear+Silvia+%26amp%3B+A+Tiny+Bit+Marvellous+-+Kindl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc7eea7fbc566217f00419abcc17d2b9dbea3b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,199,238,167,251,197,102,33,127,0,65,154,188,193,125,43,157,190,163,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
