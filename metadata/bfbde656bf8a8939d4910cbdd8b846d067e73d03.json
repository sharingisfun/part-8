She finds shelter and stumbles upon the territory of a wolf and her puppy. She barricades herself, but as time passes she finds the wolf less and less frightening. When she finds out three shepherds are out to kill the wolf, she decides to get across the border to Sweden, where they don't hunt for wolves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfbde656bf8a8939d4910cbdd8b846d067e73d03","amp;dn":"Ulvesommer+-+Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfbde656bf8a8939d4910cbdd8b846d067e73d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,189,230,86,191,138,137,57,212,145,12,189,216,184,70,208,103,231,61,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
