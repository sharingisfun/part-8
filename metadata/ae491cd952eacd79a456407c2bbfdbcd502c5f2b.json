This series makes a reasonable fist of it and far better than the truly awful made for TV version.\n\nFor those who do not know the story, it is 1963 and Hitler is about to celebrate his 75th birthday in Berlin. All is going well, but shortly before the celebrations, the body of an aged Nazi is found floating in a lake. Detective Xavier March is detailed to the case, his investigations taking him to the dark heart of Nazi Germany.\n\nIf you have not read the book, after listening to this go out and buy a copy, to fully appreciate the gripping tale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae491cd952eacd79a456407c2bbfdbcd502c5f2b","amp;dn":"Fatherland+-+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae491cd952eacd79a456407c2bbfdbcd502c5f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,73,28,217,82,234,205,121,164,86,64,124,43,191,219,205,80,44,95,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
