Of Czech origin, he has lived in exile in France since 1975, having become a naturalised citizen in 1981. He &quot;sees himself as a French writer and insists his work should be studied as French literature and classified as such in book stores.&quot;\n\nKundera's best-known work is The Unbearable Lightness of Being. His books were banned by the Communist regimes of Czechoslovakia until the downfall of the regime in the Velvet Revolution of 1989. He lives virtually incognito and rarely speaks to the media. A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he has been nominated on several occasions.\n\nAlthough his early poetic works are staunchly pro-communist, his novels escape ideological classification. Kundera has repeatedly insisted on being considered a novelist, rather than a political or dissident writer. Political commentary has all but disappeared from his novels (starting specifically after The Unbearable Lightness of Being) except in relation to broader philosophical themes. Kundera's style of fiction, interlaced with philosophical digression, greatly inspired by the novels of Robert Musil and the philosophy of Nietzsche,  is also used by authors Alain de Botton and Adam Thirlwell. Kundera takes his inspiration, as he notes often enough, not only from the Renaissance authors Giovanni Boccaccio and Rabelais, but also from Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, Denis Diderot, Robert Musil, Witold Gombrowicz, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafka, Martin Heidegger, and perhaps most importantly, Miguel de Cervantes, to whose legacy he considers himself most committed.\n\nIn 1985, Kundera received the Jerusalem Prize. His acceptance address is printed in his essay collection The Art of the Novel. He won The Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1987. In 2000, he was awarded the international Herder Prize. In 2007, he was awarded the Czech State Literature Prize.In 2010, he was made an honorary citizen of his hometown, Brno. In 2011, he received the Ovid Prize. The asteroid 7390 Kundera, discovered at the KleÃ…Â¥ Observatory in 1983, is named in his honor.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in epub format unless otherwise stated:\n\n*  Novels\n\nIdentity (1998) -- PDF\n\nIgnorance (2000)\n\nThe Joke (1967)\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984)\n\n\n*  Short story collection\n\nLaughable Loves (1969)\n\n\n*  Essays\n\nTestaments Betrayed - An Essay in Nine Parts (1993) -- PDF\n\nThe Art of the Novel (1986)\n\nThe Curtain (2005)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Kundera&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2977/the-art-of-fiction-no-81-milan-kundera&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2977/the-art-of-fiction-no-81-milan-kundera&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/kundera-talk.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/kundera-talk.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-milan-kundera-by-lois-oppenheim/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-milan-kundera-by-lois-oppenheim/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76acc1003416a0838f80ddd446e5d40f3cdc26f0","amp;dn":"Milan+Kundera+-+Novels%2C+Short+Stories+%26amp%3B+Essays+%288+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76acc1003416a0838f80ddd446e5d40f3cdc26f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,172,193,0,52,22,160,131,143,128,221,212,70,229,212,15,60,220,38,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
