Henkel, S. Parameswaran, &quot;Designing Embedded Processors: A Low Power Perspective&quot;\nSpr ger | 2007 | ISBN: 1402058683 | 550 pages | PDF | 5,3 MB\n\nAs we embrace the world of personal, portable, and perplexingly complex digital systems, it has befallen upon the bewildered designer to take advantage of the available transistors to produce a system which is small, fast, cheap and correct, yet possesses increased functionality.\n\nIncreasingly, these systems have to consume little energy. Designers are increasingly turning towards small processors, which are low power, and customize these processors both in software and hardware to achieve their objectives of a low power system, which is verified, and has short design turnaround times.\n\nDesigning Embedded Processors examines the many ways in which processor based systems are designed to allow low power devices. It looks at processor design methods, memory optimization, dynamic voltage scaling methods, compiler methods, and multi processor methods. Each section has an introductory chapter to give a breadth view, and have a few specialist chapters in the area to give a deeper perspective. The book provides a good starting point to engineers in the area, and to research students embarking upon the exciting area of embedded systems and architectures.
