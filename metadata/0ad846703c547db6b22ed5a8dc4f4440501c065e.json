It is an adventure film strongly influenced by the work of Jacques Rivette and Jean-Luc Godard but with a unique and artistic discourse of its own.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad846703c547db6b22ed5a8dc4f4440501c065e","amp;dn":"Ghost+Dance+-+Ken+McMullen+%28inc.+extras%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad846703c547db6b22ed5a8dc4f4440501c065e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,216,70,112,60,84,125,182,178,46,213,168,220,79,68,64,80,28,6,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
