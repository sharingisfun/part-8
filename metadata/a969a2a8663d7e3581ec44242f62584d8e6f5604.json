A Day In The Life was nominated for the 2000 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. \n\nThey hardly ever make &amp;#039;em like this anymore. Once upon a time, as lovingly documented on priceless collections like GOLDEN THROATS, non-singers like William Shatner, Joey Bishop and Sebastian Cabot would try their hand at vocalizing, with unintentionally hilarious results. By the &amp;#039;90s such folks were far too self-conscious for that sort of endeavor, and the novelty well ran dry. When Beatles producer George Martin decided it was time to make his own album, he obviously remembered his beginnings as a successful comedy producer. He assembled the entertaining, (intentionally) side-splitting IN MY LIFE. Calling upon the likes of Robin Williams, Jim Carrey and Sean Connery to interpret classic Beatles tunes will surely earn Martin an eternal place in the Dr. Demento Hall of Fame, and a reputation as a man confident enough to poke fun at his own musical legacy.\n\n\n 01Come Together - Bobby McFerrin\n 02: Hard Day&amp;#039;s Night, A - Goldie Hawn\n 03: Day In The Life, A - Jeff Beck\n 04: Here There &amp; Everywhere - Celine Dion\n 05: Because - Vanessa Mae\n 06: I Am The Walrus - Jim Carrey  07: Here Comes The Sun - John Williams (Film, Easy Listening)\n 08: Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite - Billy Connolly\n 09: PEPPERLAND SUITE MEDLEY, THE: Pepperland/March Of The Meanies/Sea Of  Monsters/Pepperland (Reprise)\n 10: MEDLEY: Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/End, The - Phil Collins\n 11: Friends And Lovers\n 12: In My Life - Sean Connery \n    \n  \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a969a2a8663d7e3581ec44242f62584d8e6f5604","amp;dn":"George+martin+-+In+my+life+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a969a2a8663d7e3581ec44242f62584d8e6f5604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,105,162,168,102,61,126,53,129,236,68,36,47,98,88,77,142,111,86,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
