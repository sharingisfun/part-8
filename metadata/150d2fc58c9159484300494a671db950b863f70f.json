I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from users named &quot;b2pilot187&quot; and &quot;transcout&quot; (they&amp;#039;re probably the same person). Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be setled sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won&amp;#039;t even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; (and now &quot;Alex Jones&quot; too) and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nWaco: The Rules of Engagement. One of the most disturbing films you&amp;#039;ll ever see, this low-key documentary methodically and convincingly makes the case that the government -- not David Koresh -- caused the fatal fire at the Branch Davidian compound in April 1993. Using interviews, news footage, testimony before Congress, and infrared photographic analysis, the film relentlessly chips away at the government&amp;#039;s story that David Koresh and his followers were a dangerous cult involved in strange sex and drug practices who were preparing to slaughter their neighbors and that they immolated themselves ÃƒÂ  la Jonestown, rather than give themselves up peacefully. Nearly every element of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms&amp;#039; and the FBI&amp;#039;s cover-up is exposed as fraudulent and the viewer is left wondering when, if ever, justice will finally be served.\n\nRuntime......: 02:15:51\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: ~ 1274 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 158 kb/s (79/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\nFrame Size...: 592x448 (1.32:1) [=37:28]\n\nName.........: Waco.-.The.Rules.of.Engagement.-.Extra.-.01.-.Infrared.Footage.-.DocDVDRip.avi\nFilesize.....: 200 MB (or 205,618 KB or 210,552,832 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:24:17 (36,430 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 1027 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 120 kb/s (60/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\nFrame Size...: 720x544 (1.32:1) [~37:28]\n\nName.........: Waco.-.The.Rules.of.Engagement.-.Extra.-.02.-.Complete.911.Calls.-.DocDVDRip.avi\nFilesize.....: 57.6 MB (or 59,012 KB or 60,428,288 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:25:55 (38,869 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 167 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 135 kb/s (67/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\nFrame Size...: 720x544 (1.32:1) [~37:28]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150d2fc58c9159484300494a671db950b863f70f","amp;dn":"Waco%3A+The+Rules+of+Engagement+DVDRip+%28With+911+Calls+%26+Infrared","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150d2fc58c9159484300494a671db950b863f70f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,13,47,197,140,145,89,72,67,0,73,74,103,29,185,80,184,99,247,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
