You are a merchant in        \n             northern Europe in the late Middle Ages when the             \n             Hanseatic League was flourishing.

You start bargaining with common         \n             goods, build up your own production and establish a          \n             merchant fleet.

On your way to power you have to hold your ground     \n             against fierce rivals, whom you have to fight with           \n             economic competition, price wars or impure means such as     \n             sabotage.
