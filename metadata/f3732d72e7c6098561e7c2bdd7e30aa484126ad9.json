The song served as the reissue's first single on September 25, 2012 through Interscope Records, Polydor Records, and Universal Music.[2][3] The cover for the single depicts Del Rey on a tire swing, wearing cowboy boots and a denim jacket.[3] In general, the song was well received by critics. Co-written by &quot;Video Games&quot; author Justin Parker, &quot;Ride&quot; is a pop ballad that thematically involves parental problems, alcohol consumption, and loneliness.\nTeaming up with Anthony Mandler, director of &quot;National Anthem&quot;, Del Rey premiered the ancillary music video at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10 and saw an official release on October 12. Del Rey's role in the video for &quot;Ride&quot; was compared to Lolita and A Streetcar Named Desire. Thematically, the video was panned for being antifeministic and encouraging prostitution in young women. The monologue treatment at the prologue and epilogue of the video met polarized opinion; some considered it &quot;meaningless&quot; and a &quot;jibe to her critics&quot;, while others called it &quot;moving&quot; and &quot;really something&quot;. Contemporary critics praised the recording. Vocally, the song drew comparisons with Adele and Brandon Flowers of The Killers. Becoming a modest hit in the United States, Belgium, and France, the song reached the top-ten on Russia's Lenta.Ru record chart.\n\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 22.1 MiB\nDuration                                 : 9mn 38s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Born To Die The Paradise Edition\nTrack name                               : Ride (Full Video Version)\nPerformer                                : Lana Del Rey\nComposer                                 : Lana Del Rey\nGenre                                    : Indie Pop\nWriting library                          : LAME\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover description                        : thumbnail\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 9mn 38s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 22.1 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                          : LAME\n\nVideo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3732d72e7c6098561e7c2bdd7e30aa484126ad9","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+Ride+%28Full+Video+Version%29+MP3+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3732d72e7c6098561e7c2bdd7e30aa484126ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,115,45,114,231,198,9,133,97,231,194,189,215,227,10,164,132,18,106,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
