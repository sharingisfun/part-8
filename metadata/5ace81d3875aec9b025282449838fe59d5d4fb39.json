Frank Muir - DI Gilchrist series[Books 01-03]Epub\n\nRequirements: ePUB Reader, 2.79 MB\nOverview: Born in Glasgow, Frank was plagued from a young age with the urge to see more of the world than the rain sodden slopes of the Campsie Fells. By the time he graduated from University with a degree he hated, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d already had more jobs than the River Clyde has bends. Short stints as a lumberjack in the Scottish Highlands and a moulderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s labourer in the local foundry convinced Frank that his degree was not such a bad idea after all. Twenty-five years of working overseas helped him appreciate the raw beauty of his home country. Now a dual US/UK citizen, Frank divides his time between Richmond, Virginia, and Glasgow, Scotland, carrying out research in the local pubs and restaurants. Frank is currently doing some serious book research in St Andrews' local pubs, and working on his next novel, another crime story suffused with dark alleyways and cobbled streets and some things gruesome.\n\nGenre: Fiction, Mystery/Thriller\n\nBook 1: Eye For An Eye: The downpour will obliterate all trace of my passing, I smile. Tonight I have started my journey to Hell. The misty streets of St Andrews provide the setting for the bloody attacks of an unhinged serial killer. Six men have been brutally murdered; all known wife beaters. It is DI Andy Gilchrists job to catch the perpetrator of these horrendous crimes; failure to do so meaning the end of his career. As he goes on the hunt for the killer, Gilchrist is forced to confront both his own personal demons as well as increasing pressure from invasive press and hostile superiors. On being suspended from duty, he is forced to go out on a limb. With only his trusty sixth sense for support he must unravel a series of uncertain and mysterious leads. Who can he trust and who is deceiving him? As Gilchrist gets closer to his target these questions become more uncertain. The chase becomes not only a race for survival but a personal quest for his own self worth and value.\n\nBook 2: Hand For A Hand: When DCI Andy Gilchrist is called to a crime scene to find an amputated hand clutching a note addressed to him, a note that contains only one word, murder, he is pulled into an investigation that will test him to the limit. Soon other single word clues are found along with amputated body parts and the murderer's vengeful message becomes clear as the identity of the next intended victim is revealed. But when someone close to him disappears, Gilchrist knows he is too late. Together with Nance Wilson, the sexy DC with her own agenda, Gilchrist comes to see the answer to the present murders lies within the secrets of his past. Forced to confront his demons, Gilchrist must solve the cryptic clues and find the murderer before the next victim, a woman whose life means more to Gilchrist than his own, is served up to him piece by slaughtered piece.\n\nBook 3: Tooth For A Tooth: When a woman's skeleton is discovered in a shallow grave DCI Andy Gilchrist is tasked with finding her murderer. But a psychic's warnings and markings on a rusted cigarette lighter found among the rotted remains set Gilchrist off on a trail that will take him back 35 years back to his past and on course to find his brother's killer. What secrets from the past was he about to uncover? When a woman's skeleton is discovered in a shallow grave DCI Andy Gilchrist is tasked with finding her murderer. But a psychic's warnings and markings on a rusted cigarette lighter found among the rotted remains set Gilchrist off on a trail that will take him back 35 years back to his past and on course to find his brother's killer in a fatal hit and run accident. When dental records from an extracted tooth force Gilchrist to confront the unthinkable - that his brother was her killer - he keeps his fears to himself, only to be suspended on suspicion of destroying evidence. But Gilchrist battles on in his quest for answers. Who was the woman? Why was she murdered? And was the fatal hit and run really an accident?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ace81d3875aec9b025282449838fe59d5d4fb39","amp;dn":"T.+Frank+Muir+-+DI+Gilchrist+series%5BBooks+01-03%5DEpub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ace81d3875aec9b025282449838fe59d5d4fb39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,206,129,211,135,90,236,155,2,82,130,68,152,56,254,89,213,212,251,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
