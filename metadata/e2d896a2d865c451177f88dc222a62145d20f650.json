Do men meeting for the first time look classically like chimpanzees establishing dominance? And do children sneaking candy parallel chimps deceiving their alpha male? Six million years ago, we branched off from the family tree we share with our ape cousins and monkey uncles. We may have evolved since then, but there's still an ape in all of us.... You may have evolved over the past six million years, but there's still an ape in all of us. Ape Man combines stunts, humorous experiments, hidden-camera footage and expert analysis to demonstrate the curious, unspoken customs that govern your behaviour. Presented by Brit actor Peter Elliot (dubbed 'the film industry's primary primate') this one-off special explores the daily battles for power, territory, sex and allegiance.\n\n\n1)  The Alpha Male \nFood and sex: with all the benefits that come with being the alpha male, it's no surprise that male apes work so hard to get to the top. But it's not just our chimpanzee cousins who are in a constant struggle for power. From the world leader's power walk and the CEO's dominance posture, to our subtle everyday power struggles with strangers, this episode explores how those similar instincts remain, and how - just like in the jungle - so many human interactions can be a battle to become king of the swingers.\n\n2)  Hooking Up \nThe desire to find a mate drives a lot of ape behavior, and despite millions of years of evolution, we're no exception. We'll explore the different mating strategies of our ape cousins, and look at how we retain some of the same preferences. To demonstrate this, NGC carries out a series of social experiments designed to bring out the inner ape in unsuspecting humans and compare their interactions with that of primates.\n\n3)  Social Climbers \nEvery wonder why so many people seek fame? Our desire to be popular comes from an instinctive need to be liked. In this episode, find out why primates and humans both need to be part of social groups. Primatology experts compare ape behavior to that of humans to see how chitchat can improve status, and why we're so good at deception. Hidden camera footage reveals our natural instinct to social climb, gossip and deceive.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2020/6svo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2020/6svo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3275/zysw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3275/zysw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1758/f2k3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1758/f2k3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/5573/hi0q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/5573/hi0q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/617/do8c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/617/do8c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/2840/c03f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/2840/c03f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/790/m3az.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/790/m3az.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/7618/as4o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/7618/as4o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/5074/p52j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/5074/p52j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fcb4959b94bcb0cfd2cd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2162 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 695 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://natgeotv.com/uk/ape-man&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://natgeotv.com/uk/ape-man&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d896a2d865c451177f88dc222a62145d20f650","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Ape+Man+2of3+Hooking+Up+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d896a2d865c451177f88dc222a62145d20f650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,216,150,162,216,101,196,81,23,127,136,220,34,42,98,20,93,32,246,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
