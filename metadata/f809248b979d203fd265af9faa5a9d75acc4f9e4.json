When Weill was in his teens the director of the Dessau Hoftheater, Albert Bing, encouraged him in the study of music. Weill briefly studied composition with Engelbert Humperdinck and was already working professionally as a conductor when he attended composer Ferruccio Busoni's master classes in Berlin. Delighted to see the positive responses of an audience to his first collaboration with playwright Georg Kaiser, Der Protagonist (1926), he thereafter resolved to work toward accessibility in his music. In 1926 Weill married actress Lotte Lenya, whose reedy, quavering singing voice he called &quot;the one I hear in my head when I am writing my songs.&quot;\n\nIn 1927 Weill began his collaboration with leftist playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht; their first joint venture, Mahagonny-Songspiel (1927), launched the number &quot;Alabama Song.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f809248b979d203fd265af9faa5a9d75acc4f9e4","amp;dn":"Kurt+Weill+-+Die+Dreigroschenoper+%28Lotte+Lenya%2C+1958%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f809248b979d203fd265af9faa5a9d75acc4f9e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,9,36,139,151,157,32,63,210,101,175,159,170,90,157,117,172,196,249,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
