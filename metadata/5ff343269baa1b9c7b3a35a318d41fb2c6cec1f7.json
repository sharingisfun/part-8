Stafford was greatly admired for the purity of her voice and was considered one of the most versatile vocalists of the era. She was also considered a pioneer of modern musical parody, having won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album in 1961 (with husband Paul Weston) for their album Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris.\n\n\nA very under appreciated singer, ranks right there with Ella Fitzgerald as one of the top American female vocalists of the twentieth century.  This is a representative sampling of her work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff343269baa1b9c7b3a35a318d41fb2c6cec1f7","amp;dn":"Jo+Stafford+-+Collectors+Series+-+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff343269baa1b9c7b3a35a318d41fb2c6cec1f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,243,67,38,155,170,27,156,123,58,53,163,24,212,31,178,198,206,193,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
