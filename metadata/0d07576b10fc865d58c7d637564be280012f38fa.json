M. Nouwen - Behold the Beauty of the Lord: Praying with Icons (Ave Maria Press, 1987). 80 pages + plates.\n\nNew scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\ndescription:\n\nFull color fold-outs of four superb Russian icons combine with the studied reflections of Henri J.M. Nouwen to offer the reader a unique way to pray with sacred images as much as with words. The meditations are the fruit of Nouwen's long viewing of the icons as the iconographer intended--as holy places, not as decorations.\n\nNote: the four icons that are the subject of these meditations are included as pages at the end of the pdf file, and also as separate high resolution jpg files.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d07576b10fc865d58c7d637564be280012f38fa","amp;dn":"Henri+Nouwen+-+Behold+the+Beauty+of+the+Lord+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d07576b10fc865d58c7d637564be280012f38fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,7,87,107,16,252,134,93,88,199,214,55,86,75,226,128,1,47,56,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
