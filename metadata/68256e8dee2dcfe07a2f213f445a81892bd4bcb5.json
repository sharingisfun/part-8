More than 90% of all face-to-face communication is non-verbal, and the silent messages of body language often reveal more than the spoken word in conveying true feelings, highly influencing first impressions and the self-image we project to others. This guide includes practical exercises to enhance understanding of non-verbal communication, and covers such aspects of body language as special features of the workplace and non-verbal communication in international contexts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68256e8dee2dcfe07a2f213f445a81892bd4bcb5","amp;dn":"Understand+Body+Language+-+%282011%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68256e8dee2dcfe07a2f213f445a81892bd4bcb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,37,110,141,238,45,207,224,122,47,33,63,68,90,129,137,43,212,188,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
