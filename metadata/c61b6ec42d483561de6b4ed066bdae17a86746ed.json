All the latest studies prove that strength training, not aerobics, provides the key to losing fat and building a fit, strong body.\nThis book refutes the misconception that women will Ã¢â‚¬Å“bulk upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ if they lift heavy weights. Nonsense! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough enough for men to pack on muscle, and they have much more of the hormone necessary to build muscle: natural testosterone. Muscles need to be strengthened to achieve a lean, healthy look. Properly conditioned muscles increase metabolism and promote weight lossÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that simple.\nThe program demands that women put down the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BarbieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ weights, step away from the treadmill, and begin a strength and conditioning regime for the natural athlete in every woman.\nThe New Rules of Lifting for Women, now in paperback, will change the way women see fitness, nutrition, and their own bodies.\n\nTable of Contents\nPART 1 - BEHIND THE COVER LINES\nChapter 1 - Why Should a Woman Lift Like a Man?\nChapter 2 - The Truth About Your Muscles\nChapter 3 - Step Away from the Treadmill\nPART 2 - YOU AREN'T WHAT YOU DON'T EAT\nChapter 4 - The War Against Food\nChapter 5 - The Carb Wars Are So Over\nChapter 6 - Good Nutrition: Simple Versus Simplistic\nChapter 7 - Our Meal Plans Can Beat Up Their Meal Plans\nPART 3 - RESISTANCE IS VITAL\nChapter 8 - Smart Women, Foolish Workouts\nChapter 9 - Core of Babylon\nChapter 10 - A Woman ' s Place Is in the Weight Room\nChapter 11 - The Right Moves\nChapter 12 - Extra Stuff to Do\nChapter 13 - Yes , You\nNotes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61b6ec42d483561de6b4ed066bdae17a86746ed","amp;dn":"The+New+Rules+of+Lifting+for+Women+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61b6ec42d483561de6b4ed066bdae17a86746ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,27,110,196,45,72,53,97,222,107,78,208,102,189,174,23,168,103,70,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
