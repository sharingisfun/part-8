A wristband marked her as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“flight risk,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and her medical recordsÃ¢â‚¬â€chronicling a monthlong hospital stay of which she had no memory at allÃ¢â‚¬â€showed hallucinations, violence, and dangerous instability. Only weeks earlier, Susannah had been on the threshold of a new, adult life: a healthy, ambitious college grad a few months into her first serious relationship and a promising career as a cub reporter at a major New York newspaper. Who was the stranger who had taken over her body? What was happening to her mind?\n \n \nIn this swift and breathtaking narrative, Susannah tells the astonishing true story of her inexplicable descent into madness and the brilliant, lifesaving diagnosis that nearly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen. A team of doctors would spend a monthÃ¢â‚¬â€and more than a million dollarsÃ¢â‚¬â€trying desperately to pin down a medical explanation for what had gone wrong. Meanwhile, as the days passed and her family, boyfriend, and friends helplessly stood watch by her bed, she began to move inexorably through psychosis into catatonia and, ultimately, toward death. Yet even as this period nearly tore her family apart, it offered an extraordinary testament to their faith in Susannah and their refusal to let her go.\n\n \nThen, at the last minute, celebrated neurologist Souhel Najjar joined her team and, with the help of a lucky, ingenious test, saved her life. He recognized the symptoms of a newly discovered autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks the brain, a disease now thought to be tied to both schizophrenia and autism, and perhaps the root of Ã¢â‚¬Å“demonic possessionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ throughout history.\n \n\nFar more than simply a riveting read and a crackling medical mystery, Brain on Fire is the powerful account of one womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle to recapture her identity and to rediscover herself among the fragments left behind. Using all her considerable journalistic skills, and building from hospital records and surveillance video, interviews with family and friends, and excerpts from the deeply moving journal her father kept during her illness, Susannah pieces together the story of her Ã¢â‚¬Å“lost monthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to write an unforgettable memoir about memory and identity, faith and love. It is an important, profoundly compelling tale of survival and perseverance that is destined to become a classic.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89d7474e0e2a78cce6b105bf9d037726f48632b","amp;dn":"Brain+on+Fire+by+Susannah+Cahalan+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89d7474e0e2a78cce6b105bf9d037726f48632b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,157,116,116,224,226,167,140,206,107,16,91,249,208,55,114,111,72,99,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
