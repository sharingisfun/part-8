The zombie threat is defeated, infrastructure has collapsed, fuel is scarce, and scavenging means survival.\r\nInitially the Galaxy contains hundreds of fleets, each trying to survive. AI captains do everything the player can. The player is not special and is not the center of the Galaxy.\r\nAs resource scarcity becomes critical, ships come into conflict just to survive.
