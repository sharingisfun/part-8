Filmed in real time, the cameras capture the road unfurling, the passing scenery and the occasional chatter of passengers. It begins in Richmond in North Yorkshire and takes viewers on a lush and varied ride, along a river valley thronged by hawthorn trees, through mining villages and wild flower-filled meadows. The bus climbs into the Dales, vast and peaceful, and then the final stretch across cotton-grass-covered moorland. With the mountain range known as the Three Peaks in the distance, the bus descends towards the Ribblehead viaduct. The programme features captions integrated into the landscape to provide details about the countryside through which the bus is passing - from aspects of the natural or geological environment to specific highlights of Britain's agricultural or industrial heritage.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 25 (~1424Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~144Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 119 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.30 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSubtitles: Merged\r\n\r\n1080p/x264/mkv available at MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1056248b2bb101e2d0c48a27fa07e68610b0c5bf","amp;dn":"BBC+All+Aboard%3A+The+Country+Bus+576p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1056248b2bb101e2d0c48a27fa07e68610b0c5bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,86,36,139,43,177,1,226,208,196,138,39,250,7,230,134,16,176,197,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
