As you may have surmised from the packaging,          \n           this title applies to both a CD and a DVD. These are           \n           separate releases in separate formats with the same name.      \n           Some of the material contained on the Bigger and               \n           Blackerer DVD, directed by Lance Bangs, will air as a          \n           television special on the cable channel Epix on April          \n           10th. And, yes, there is some overlap between the CD and       \n           the DVD, but not a lot. Though both media are housed on a      \n           shiny, silver five-inch disc, each is an entity unto           \n           itself, full of material that appears solely on one or         \n           the other. Only by watching the DVD will you learn of          \n           Cross unique relationship with the deaf community, share       \n           his canny insights into the editorial machinations behind      \n           the Bible, and marvel at how well a bald, middle-aged          \n           white guy can fill out a pair of jeans. Yet one must           \n           listen to the CD in order to hear about gastro-intestinal      \n           misadventures with his dog Ollie Red Sox, or sing along        \n           with The Sultan s Revenge, the swinging, Vegas-style           \n           opening number composed by Cross and his good friend Mark      \n           Rivers (author of the theme to Mr. Show).                      \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Mort Burke................. : ..................Featuring      \n           David Cross................ : ....................Himself      \n           Dean Crow.................. : ..................Featuring      \n           Todd Glass................. : ..................Featuring      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
