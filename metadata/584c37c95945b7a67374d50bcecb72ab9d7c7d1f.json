No other book covers the topic in such a comprehensive manner and in such high quality, and this new edition retains the three-volume format: Catalyst Development, Applications in Organic Synthesis and Polymer Synthesis. Edited by a Nobel laureate in the field, and with a list of contributors that reads like a &quot;Who's-Who&quot; of metathesis, this is an indispensable one-stop reference for organic, polymer and industrial chemists, as well as chemists working with organometallics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584c37c95945b7a67374d50bcecb72ab9d7c7d1f","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Metathesis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584c37c95945b7a67374d50bcecb72ab9d7c7d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,76,55,201,89,69,183,166,115,116,213,11,206,203,114,171,157,124,125,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
