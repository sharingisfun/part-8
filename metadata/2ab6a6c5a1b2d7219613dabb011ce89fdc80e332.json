A little iffy in the first ten volumes in terms of legibility, due to poor copying, but most of the pages are legible.\n\nUnlike certain other collections, which will go unmentioned, these don't have elbows in them.\n\nIf you like the magazine, please support it.  I won't be scanning in my copies of Volumes 26 and 27, as 2600 is now releasing these as DRM-free PDF's directly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ab6a6c5a1b2d7219613dabb011ce89fdc80e332","amp;dn":"25+Years+of+2600","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ab6a6c5a1b2d7219613dabb011ce89fdc80e332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,182,166,197,161,178,215,33,150,19,218,187,1,28,232,159,220,128,227,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
