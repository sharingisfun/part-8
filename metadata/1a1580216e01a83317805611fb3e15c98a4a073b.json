The story (as pieced together by fans and through what Claudio has told us) is on there. You should also check out the Amory Wars comic books which tell the story that these albums tell in comic book form.\n\n\nThis is a great band that makes music different from anything else that&amp;#039;s out there, they deserve our support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a1580216e01a83317805611fb3e15c98a4a073b","amp;dn":"Coheed+and+Cambria+discography+%28as+of+June+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a1580216e01a83317805611fb3e15c98a4a073b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,21,128,33,110,1,168,51,23,128,86,17,251,62,21,201,138,74,7,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
