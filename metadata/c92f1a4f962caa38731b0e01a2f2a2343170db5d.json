Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), and Mike McCready (lead guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.\nFormed after the demise of Ament and Gossard's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicised boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;\nTo date, the band has sold over 30 million records in the U.S,[3] and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Allmusic refers to Pearl Jam as &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s.&quot;\n\n.:Pearl Jam Group:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3322/pearljamredux.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3322/pearljamredux.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGli album\nMp3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 320 kbps\n\nStudio albums\n1991 - Ten (Epic) @320\n1991 - Ten (Sony) @320\n1993 - Vs @320\n1994 - Vitalogy (Epic) @320\n1994 - Vitalogy (Sony) @320\n1995 - Mirror Ball (Neil Young featuring Pearl Jam) @320\n1996 - No Code @320\n1998 - Yield @320\n2000 - Binaural (Sony, 2 CD) @320\nCD1 Binaural\nCD2 Bonus Disc\n2002 - Riot Act @320\n2006 - Pearl Jam @320\n2009 - Backspacer @320\n2009 - Ten (Deluxe Edition, 2 CD + DVD) @320\nCD1 Newly remastered\nCD2 Ten Redux\nMTV Unplugged DVDrip (avi, XviD) @320\n\nSome Live albums\n1992-09-20 Drop In The Park (2009) @320\n1998 Live On Two Legs @320\n2004 Live at Benaroya Hall (2 CD) @320\n\nCompilations\n1994 - The Complete B-Sides &amp; MTV Unplugged @320\n2003 - Lost Dogs (Epic, 2 CD) @320\n2004 - Rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003) (Epic, 2 CD) @320\n\nExtended plays\n1995 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Merkinball @320\n\nSome Singles\n1991 - Alive (Epic) @320\n1992 - Alive (Sony) @320\n1992 - Even Flow @320\n1992 - Jeremy @320\n1992 - Oceans @320\n1993 - Daughter @320\n1993 - Go @320\n1994 - Animal @320\n1994 - Dissident (Live in Atlanta Box Set, 3 CD) @320\n1994 - Spin The Black Circle @320\n1995 - Immortality @320\n1995 - Not For You @320\n1996 - Hail Hail @320\n1996 - Off He Goes @320\n1996 - Who You Are @320\n1997 - Given To Fly @320\n1998 - Wishlist @320\n1999 - Last Kiss @320\n2000 - Light Years @320\n2000 - Nothing As It Seems (Epic) @320\n2000 - Nothing As It Seems (Sony) @320\n2002 - I Am Mine (Epic 1) @320\n2002 - I Am Mine (Epic 2) @320\n2003 - Love Boat Captain @320\n2003 - Man Of The Hour @320\n2006 - World Wide Suicide @320\n2009 - 10 From Ten Radio Sampler (Promo) @320\n2009 - Just Breathe @320\n2009 - The Fixer @320\n2009 - The Fixer (Promo) @320\n\nSome Official Bootlegs (Binaural Tour 2000)\n\nEurope Bootlegs\n05-23 EstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡dio do Restelo, Lisbon, Portugal (2 CD) @320\n05-25 Palau Sant Jordi, Barcelona, Spain (Catalonia) (2 CD) @320\n05-26 Velodromo de Anoeta, San Sebastian, Spain (Basque Country) (2 CD) @320\n05-29 Wembley Arena, London, England (2 CD) @320\n05-30 Wembley Arena, London, England (2 CD) @320\n06-01 The Point Theatre, Dublin, Ireland (2 CD) @320\n06-03 SECC, Glasgow, Scotland (2 CD) @320\n06-25 Wuhlheide, Berlin, Germany (2 CD) @320\n06-29 Spektrum, Oslo, Norway (2 CD) @320\n\nNorth America Leg 1 Bootlegs\n08-07 Philips Arena, Atlanta, Georgia (2 CD) @320\n08-12 Ice Palace, Tampa, Florida (2 CD) @320\n08-21 Polaris Amphitheater, Columbus, Ohio (2 CD) @320\n08-24 Jones Beach Amphitheater, Wantagh, New York (2 CD) @320\n08-25 Jones Beach Amphitheater, Wantagh, New York (2 CD) @320\n08-29 Tweeter Center Boston, Mansfield, Massachusetts (2 CD) @320\n09-01 Blockbuster Music Entertainment Centre, Camden, New Jersey (2 CD) @320\n10-09 Allstate Arena, Chicago, Illinois (2 CD) @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92f1a4f962caa38731b0e01a2f2a2343170db5d","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Discography+1991-2009++%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92f1a4f962caa38731b0e01a2f2a2343170db5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,47,26,79,150,44,170,56,115,27,14,1,162,242,162,52,49,112,219,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
