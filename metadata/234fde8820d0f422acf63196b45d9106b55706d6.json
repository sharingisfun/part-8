A horrible murder has taken place in a ritzy hotel. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing worse than retiring from the dirty detective business only to be pulled back in by a silently screaming pair of corpses. NameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MacPherson, Gus to my friends. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to take on this job but the dame was loaded, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not talking cash. Women, the one weakness of a lonely gumshoe, they bat their eyelashes and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like putty in their hands. Turns out the stiffs were her sister and brother-in-law. As is usual for the fuzz, they acted like rampaging bulls in a china shop, made a mess of the whole case and that leaves me as lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own janitor. Sigh, guess I better get cracking before the stiffs get too cold.\n\nWelcome to Post Mortem, a moody, blood-drenched first-person detective thriller set in 1920Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Paris, France. Step into the shoes of Gus MacPherson, a former detective who wanted to retire to a quiet life of painting, as he takes on a grisly double murder mystery. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet plenty of unique characters on your way to solving the mystery, but beware, not all of them can be trusted and some can lead you down a dangerous path if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not careful. Can you crack the case before it kills you?\n\nAge requirements: ESRB Rating: MATURE with Blood and Gore, Mature Sexual Themes, Violence.
