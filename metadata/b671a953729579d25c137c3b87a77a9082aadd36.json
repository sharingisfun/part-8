These are the courageous men and women who forge headfirst into danger when everyone else is running the other way. But the enormous responsibilities of the job also take a personal toll.\n\nWith big reputations and hefty egos, the pressure to perform and make split-second decisions is bound to put squad members at odds. When a tragedy claims one of their own, there's plenty of guilt and blame to go around. In the middle of a divorce, Lt. Matthew Casey tries to go about business as usual, but can't help butting heads with the brash Lt. Kelly Severide of the Rescue Squad - and each blames the other for their fallen team member. When it's &quot;go-time,&quot; though, they put their differences aside and put everything on the line for each other. This is a look inside one of America's noblest professions.\n\nFrom renowned Emmy-winning producer Dick Wolf and the writing team behind &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; comes an edge-of-your-seat view of a dirty job that often means the difference between life and death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b671a953729579d25c137c3b87a77a9082aadd36","amp;dn":"Chicago.Fire.S02E16.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b671a953729579d25c137c3b87a77a9082aadd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,113,169,83,114,149,121,210,92,19,124,59,135,167,122,144,130,170,221,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
