Was he related to US President George Bush? How was he connected to the founder of Scientology, NASA, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Jack the Ripper, Winston Churchill, Ian Fleming and how did this Occultist, Spy, Poet, Writer and accomplished Mountaineer come to know and influence so many other remarkable people?\n\nIn Search Of The Great Beast 666 - Aleister Crowley\n\nFeaturing the Voice of Joss Ackland and Music Score by Rick Wakeman\n\nSize: 1208MB (1267377444 bytes)\nMedia Legth: 02:06:22\nVideo Size: 640 x 360\nVideo: XVID 640x360 29.97fps 1195Kbps [Video 0]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128Kbps [Audio 1]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aleister-crowley-666.com/HOME.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aleister-crowley-666.com/HOME.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd21fa9457f65b520389dde65d818f75fa178698","amp;dn":"In+Search+Of+The+Great+Beast+666+-+Aleister+Crowley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd21fa9457f65b520389dde65d818f75fa178698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,33,250,148,87,246,91,82,3,137,221,230,93,129,143,117,250,23,134,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
