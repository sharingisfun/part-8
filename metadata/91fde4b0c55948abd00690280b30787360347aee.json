They emerged during the second wave of black metal.\r\n\r\nTheir lyrical themes have traditionally pertained to Satanism and anti-Christianity. Certain past and present members including Blackmoon, Ahriman, Caligula and Chaq Mol have each declared an affinity for Satanism, with Ahriman and Caligula notably being practitioners of LaVeyan Satanism. In their earlier years, their lyrical themes usually revolved specifically around depictions of Hell and Satan. After Emperor Magus Caligula joined the band, their lyrics came to focus more on blasphemy and anti-Christian rhetoric, although there have been several exceptions to this.\r\n\r\nOn December 16, 2014, Dark Funeral released a new track and music video entitled &quot;Nail Them to the Cross&quot;. The video revealed a new vocalist, Heljarmadr (Gra, DomgÃ¥rd, Cursed 13) and bassist Natt (Angrepp, Withershin) to the group's ranks. The band started recording in February and their sixth album 'Where Shadows Forever Reign' will be released on June 3rd 2016.\r\nBut while all wait for it..\r\nA new single has appeared and these other two tracks so we should put out as an EP. \r\nLet us combine the titles into the title and post it...\r\n\r\nYear:\t2016\r\nStyle:\tBlack Metal\r\nCountry:\tSweden\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t32.93 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t02/04/2016 \r\n\r\nFiles:\t5\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\n\r\nLength : 0:15:33\r\n\r\nTracks:\r\n\r\n01.
