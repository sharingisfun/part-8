This comprehensively illustrated book presents the first full account of those who represented the Anglo-American experience of Venice: the author examines the lives of Whistler, Sickert, and Ruskin, among others, and shows the comradeship, and eccentric behaviour, of artists in Venice that would not have been tolerated in their native countries. A particularly important feature is a reference guide to over 350 artists, from 1819 to the present day, and there is a full and useful bibliography.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b5f7d87a963e2dbe5c26d9f580bfb4de4caebe7","amp;dn":"Venice%2C+The+Artists+Vision+-+A+guide+to+British+and+American+pai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b5f7d87a963e2dbe5c26d9f580bfb4de4caebe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,95,125,135,169,99,226,219,229,194,109,159,88,11,251,77,228,202,235,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
