It was released released only on DVD, but I've extracted it to mp3\n\n===============================================================================\n\nI've semi-remastered all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done [fuck the dynamics!]. And that's without sound quality lost because I did not use some quick automatic normalization option but instead of that I used my senses and expierience. I have also cleaned the tracks from any clicks / pops / pitches / glitches that would have been otherwise hearable on moderate volume on speakers. The transitions between the tracks there are smooth [that means there are no gaps between the tracks]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1987de89b07e749acf5b97cad42534c15644e1a8","amp;dn":"S%26M+-+Metallica+And+The+San+Francisco+Symphony+%231999%23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1987de89b07e749acf5b97cad42534c15644e1a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,135,222,137,176,126,116,154,207,91,151,202,212,37,52,193,86,68,225,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
