What would you say if I told you this one guy for some time has been compiling the absolute worst, most bizarre moments on TV and putting out DVDs of them? TV Carnage covers all areas of the worst of pop culture spanning several decades, from entertainment news to informercials to late night porn, and arranges them thematically to create one of the most bizarre, cringe-inducing, yet incredibly hilarious DVDs ever made.\n\nWith the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCasual FridaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ disc specifically (a new volume just became available to buy), youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll get to see, among other clips, numerous moments of Fabio weirdness, Donahue interviewing racist children, a grown man singing Christian songs in a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, and a housewife making squirrel melts, which yes, is as horrible as it sounds. From the crazy lady who eats dirt to the numerous local cable performances of wannabe dancers and singers, TV Carnage has it all.\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially cool is that the person who made this is from Toronto, so those of us who live nearby will for example, get a nostalgia kick out of old Pizza Pizza commercials where Bret ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe HitmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hart needs to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“crack the cardboardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. All the local stations are there, from CHCH to the Crossroads Television Network. Those not from the area will probably find some of this stuff even more bizarre, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m quite glad to be in on many of these jokes.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCasual FridaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has a few extras as well, including a few extended clips and a documentary trailer about strip club DJs. But most importantly is a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“drunkenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ audio commentary. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not noticeably drunk such as the Orgazmo or Cannibal the Musical DVDs are, but he does start tuning out a bit as time progresses. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sometimes informative on where the clips come from, but mostly itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the creator through voice scrambler making wiseass remarks. Reminds me of the Showgirls commentary track, in a good way.\n\nEven more amazing is the packaging. Inside the case there was a barf bag, a handi-wipe, foreign currency, and some police records that relate to a clip from the feature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ce158df0c7ea226c23f589815f2a1c4f319dac","amp;dn":"TV+Carnage+-+Casual+Fridays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ce158df0c7ea226c23f589815f2a1c4f319dac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,206,21,141,240,199,234,34,108,35,245,137,129,95,42,28,79,49,157,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
