On camera. With six hundred men. Snuff unfolds from the perspectives of Mr. 72, Mr. 137, and Mr. 600, who await their turn on camera in a very crowded green room. This wild, lethally funny, and thoroughly researched novel brings the huge yet underacknowledged presence of pornography in contemporary life into the realm of literary fiction at last. Who else but Chuck Palahniuk would dare do such a thing? Who else could do it so well, so unflinchingly, and with such an incendiary (you might say) climax?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0224922811dbf60f0d10501309602000e7bb3043","amp;dn":"Snuff+-+Chuck+Palahniuk.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0224922811dbf60f0d10501309602000e7bb3043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,36,146,40,17,219,246,15,13,16,80,19,9,96,32,0,231,187,48,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
