The oldest songs are &quot;They Call Me Muddy Waters&quot; and &quot;Howlin'Wolf&quot;. These songs feature guitar by Muddy and Harp by Little Walter. The late fifties tracks offer a fuller band sound. The mid-sixties songs are excellent - &quot;When The Eagle Flies&quot; and &quot;Bird Nest On The Ground&quot; are particularly infectious. The only complaint about this album is that it's only 34 minutes long - But then it's the quality, not the quantity that counts here.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. When The Eagle Flies\n2. Crawling King Snake\n3. County Jail\n4. It's All Over\n5. Bird Nest on the Ground\n6. They Call Me Muddy Waters\n7. Find Yourself Another Fool\n8. Kinfolk's Blues\n9. Making Friends\n10.
