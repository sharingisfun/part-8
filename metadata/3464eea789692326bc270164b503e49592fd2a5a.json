It is the band's first release under the Fueled by Ramen label and was released on May 6, 2003. The record's title is taken from a line from the lyrics of the track &quot;The Patron Saint of Liars and Fakes&quot;, which reads &quot;Take this to your grave, and I'll take it to mine&quot;. With producer Sean O'Keefe, the songs were written by lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist Pete Wentz, with Joe Trohman filling in guitars. Take This to Your Grave is the first Fall Out Boy CD to feature current drummer Andy Hurley. The album was recorded with an investment from Island Records but was worked by Fueled by Ramen, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3464eea789692326bc270164b503e49592fd2a5a","amp;dn":"Fall+Out+Boy+-+Take+This+To+Your+Grave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3464eea789692326bc270164b503e49592fd2a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,100,238,167,137,105,35,38,188,39,1,100,181,3,228,149,146,253,42,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
