It ended in February/March 2014.\n\nLearn an efficient, effective process for writing songs that express your ideas and emotions, including a range of tools that revolve around the concept of prosodyÃ‚â€”the matching of lyrics and music to support your underlying message. \n\nThereÃ‚â€™s a songwriter lurking somewhere inside you, peeking around corners, wondering if itÃ‚â€™s safe to come out. Now it is. This course is an invitation to let your inner songwriter step into the sunlight. All it takes is a simple Ã‚â€œyesÃ‚â€ and youÃ‚â€™ll be climbing that windy hill, marveling at the view.\n\nIf you havenÃ‚â€™t written any or many songs, this course will show you an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have, youÃ‚â€™ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.\n\nThe course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. YouÃ‚â€™ll learn to use your tools to enhance your messageÃ‚â€”to work compositionally at the same time youÃ‚â€™re developing your ideas.\n\nYouÃ‚â€™ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically itÃ‚â€™s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and youÃ‚â€™ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you donÃ‚â€™t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All youÃ‚â€™ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.\n\nAssignments will ask you to post something for peer reviewÃ‚â€”sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\n\nMost important, youÃ‚â€™ll have a lot of fun.\n\nMore information about this course is available at https://coursera.org/course/songwriting\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a202bebb9970a0e3091e5380e9eb0b05cc3a47bd","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Songwriting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a202bebb9970a0e3091e5380e9eb0b05cc3a47bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,2,190,187,153,112,160,227,9,30,83,128,233,235,11,5,204,58,71,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
