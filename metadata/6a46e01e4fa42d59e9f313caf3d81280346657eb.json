Early on, his good looks made him the James Dean of jazz. But his musical gifts never deserted him, as Career 1952?1988 amply demonstrates. This 2-CD set provides a complete overview of his entire career. \n\n\nPreview:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Career-1952-1988-Chet-Baker/dp/B0008FPIUO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-8059649-9072924?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1173567975&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Career-1952-1988-Chet-Baker/dp/B0008FPIUO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-8059649-9072924?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1173567975&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a46e01e4fa42d59e9f313caf3d81280346657eb","amp;dn":"JAZZ+-+Chet+Baker+-+Career+%281952-1988%29+%5BBOX+SET%5D+%5B2CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a46e01e4fa42d59e9f313caf3d81280346657eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,70,224,30,79,164,45,89,233,243,19,202,243,216,18,128,52,102,87,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
