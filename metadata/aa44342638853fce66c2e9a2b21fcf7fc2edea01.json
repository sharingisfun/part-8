What are tales designed to thrizzle? Tales designed to thrizzle are about evil girls and their owls. They are about Jesus' half-brother Pagus, the Mysterious Avenger, Dick Crazy, scary snakes, delicious bacon, Private Eye Johnny Silhouette, the Silver Knight, Murder She Didn't Write, the Mannister, the Space Patrol, portraits where the eyes move, Pablo Picasso, sex blimps (and their logical inverse, sex holes), the hot boy band Boybank, soccer joust, Underpants-On-His-Head Man, Hercules the Public Domain Superhero, Cousin Granpa, Mister Bossman, Mark Twain, the silent robot Citobor and, of course, the Thirties. America's favorite mustachioed physicist/writer double team of Twain and Einstein (solving new crimes and barreling through exciting new adventures), and the crime-fighting team of Snake and Bacon (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sssssssssssss!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) who make a special return just to star in Reservoir Dogs 2. Elsewhere the crusty Quincy, M.E. makes his comic book debut, struggling through the fantastic landscapes of his own dreams in Ã¢â‚¬Å“QuinceptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (in which St. Peter also gets his own comic book). Also: The Jungle Princess battles rhino traders... A story of Broadway theatrics in Ã¢â‚¬Å“All About DrainageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½... Slightly cursed merchandise... Cockney grave robbers... Cowboy Oscar Wilde... McArf the Crime Dog takes a bite out of scum... The origin of The Hamanimal... Plus a photocomic starring comedian Julie Klausner: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Voyage To Narnia.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa44342638853fce66c2e9a2b21fcf7fc2edea01","amp;dn":"Tales+Designed+to+Thrizzle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa44342638853fce66c2e9a2b21fcf7fc2edea01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,68,52,38,56,133,63,206,102,194,233,162,178,31,207,127,194,237,234,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
