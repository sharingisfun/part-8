She was missing for more than eighteen years, held captive by Phillip Craig and Nancy Garrido, and gave birth to two daughters during her imprisonment. On August 26, 2009, Garrido showed up for a meeting with his parole officer; he brought Jaycee, her daughters, and his wife Nancy with him. Their unusual behavior raised suspicions and an investigation revealed the tent behind the GarridosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ home where Jaycee had been living for nearly two decades.\n\nA Stolen Life was written by Jaycee herself and covers the period from the time of her abduction in 1991 up until the present. In her stark, compelling narrative, she opens up about what she experiencedÃ¢â‚¬â€and offers an extraordinary account of courage and resilience.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;This little memoir...was written plainly and simply by Dugard herself, without the help of a ghostwriter. And in that, it is powerful beyond its voyeurismÃ¢â‚¬Â¦reading the experience in her own words is a revelation.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€*The Washington Post*\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DugardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inspirational storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦is a firsthand testament to the resilience of the human spirit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€*USA Today*\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJaycee Dugard is an author who lives with her two daughters in California.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80223b967794e4244f8637c18de7d50d0a45312f","amp;dn":"A+Stolen+Life%3B+Jaycee+Dugard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80223b967794e4244f8637c18de7d50d0a45312f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,34,59,150,119,148,228,36,79,134,55,193,141,231,213,13,10,69,49,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
