It flows three thousand miles from east to west, passing through the factory towns of the coastal areas, through the rural heart of China, then up into the Gobi Desert, where it merges with the Old Silk Road. The highway witnesses every part of the social and economic revolution that is turning China upside down.\n\nIn this utterly surprising and deeply personal book, acclaimed National Public Radio reporter Rob Gifford, a fluent Mandarin speaker, takes the dramatic journey along Route 312 from its start in the boomtown of Shanghai to its end on the border with Kazakhstan. \n\nGifford reveals the rich mosaic of modern Chinese life in all its contradictions, as he poses the crucial questions that all of us are asking about China: Will it really be the next global superpower? Is it as solid and as powerful as it looks from the outside? And who are the ordinary Chinese people, to whom the twenty-first century is supposed to belong?\n\nGifford is not alone on his journey. The largest migration in human history is taking place along highways such as Route 312, as tens of millions of people leave their homes in search of work. He sees signs of the booming urban economy everywhere, but he also uncovers many of the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frailties, and some of the deep-seated problems that could derail ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise.\n\nNOTE:\nThis book is also known as\nChina Road: One Man's Journey into the Heart of Modern China\n\nGenre: Business &amp; Money, Economics, Travel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8050817d5cc4bb520c3bbbf6a0b3be569839b508","amp;dn":"China+Road%3A+A+Journey+into+the+future+of+a+Rising+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8050817d5cc4bb520c3bbbf6a0b3be569839b508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,80,129,125,92,196,187,82,12,59,187,246,160,179,190,86,152,57,181,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
