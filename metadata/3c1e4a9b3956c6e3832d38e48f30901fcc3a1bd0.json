Their first three studio albumsÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Eye for an Eye (1984), Animosity (1985) and Blind (1991)Ã¢â‚¬â€¢attracted the attention of Columbia Records, who signed the band in 1993. \n\nCorrosion of Conformity found success with the release of their 1994 fourth studio album, Deliverance, which peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the hits &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Clean My Wounds&quot;. \nTheir 1996 follow-up Wiseblood was also successful, and became Corrosion of Conformity's highest-charting album in the United States, peaking at number 104 on the Billboard 200. \nTheir latest album, IX, was released on July 1, 2014.\n\nAlright here's the deal: This band has such a spread out selection of music and its\neverywhere from here to there and back again. Different versions on EP's from country to country.\nThey did this so many times that its a task and a half just to actually get a majority of their material.\nSo someone asked me if I could put one together, sure I give it a shot.\n\nWell I am throwing it out here there's alot, but I am sure that there is many more floating around. So maybe this will help you or maybe not but Its what I came up with.\nNo I did not go for all the singles they have at least a dozen or more. \nOne day there will be a complete Discog of CoC but it wont be today.\n\nanalogkid6103 Sept.4 2015\n\n \t \t \nEye for an Eye (CD - 1984\nmp3\t \nAnimosity (CD - 1985\nmp3\t  \t \t \t \nTechnocracy         1987\nmp3 \t\nSix Songs With Mike Singing: 1988 \nmp\t\t\t\t\nBlind (CD - 1992\nmp3\t \nDeliverance (CD - 1994\nmp3\t \nWiseblood (CD - 1996\nmp3\t \nAmerica's Volume Dealer (CD - 2000\nmp3\t \nLive Volume (Live - 2001\nmp3\t \t \nIn the Arms of God (CD - 2005\nmp3\nYour Tomorrow (Parts 1 And 2) 2010\nmp3-flac both \t \nMegalodon           2012\nmp3 \t\t\nCorrosion of Conformity (CD - 2012\nmp3\t\nIX (CD - 2014\nmp3\n\n\nBand members\n\n    Woody Weatherman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, backing vocals (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Pepper Keenan - guitar, vocals (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006, 2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Mike Dean Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, vocals (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1987, 1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Reed Mullin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, vocals (1982Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001, 2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nFormer Members\n\n    Eric Eycke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1984)\n    Simon Bob Sinister Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (1986Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1989)\n    Karl Agell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993)\n    Phil Swisher Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1987Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1993)\n    Jimmy Bower Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2001Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\n    Merrit Partridge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003)\n    Stanton Moore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2005)\n    Jason Patterson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\n\nCollaborators\n\n    Warren Haynes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ slide guitar (&quot;Stare Too Long,&quot; America's Volume Dealer)\n    James Hetfield Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (&quot;Man or Ash,&quot; Wiseblood)\n    Robert Stewart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (performed live, never recorded)\n    Bruce Smith Ã¢â‚¬â€œ pedal steel (&quot;Shelter,&quot; Deliverance)\n    John Custer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ producer of Blind, Deliverance, Wiseblood, Nativity in Black, America's Volume Dealer, In the Arms of God, Corrosion of Conformity, the Megalodon E.P., and IX.\n\n\nIt's not perfect but its pretty good.
