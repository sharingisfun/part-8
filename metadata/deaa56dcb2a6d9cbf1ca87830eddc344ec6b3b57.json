They live in a deep and ancient forested gorge that runs though the African savannah and for fifteen years it has been cut off from the rest of the jungle, leaving the chimps imprisoned.\r\n\r\nHere, they face a daily life-or-death dilemma: whether to leave the safety of the gorge and venture into the predator-ridden savannah to find food, or face hunger. There's now only twenty of them left and, as Brutus the alpha male loses his grip, can the family hold it together or is time running out for the Kyambura chimps?\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22 (~4136Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.41 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 58 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.73 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deaa56dcb2a6d9cbf1ca87830eddc344ec6b3b57","amp;dn":"BBC+Natural+World+Chimps+of+the+Lost+Gorge+HDTV+x265-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deaa56dcb2a6d9cbf1ca87830eddc344ec6b3b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,170,86,220,178,166,217,203,241,202,135,131,14,221,195,68,236,107,59,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
