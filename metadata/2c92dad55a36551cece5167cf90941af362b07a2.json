You can either import a previous DAO character or start a new one for this mini-campaign.\n\n-=-=Installation=-=-\n\n1. If not already, update your game to v1.04.  You can find the patch easily on the internet.  If needed, apply a \n\nv1.04 No CD patch.\n2. Locate and run daupdater.exe in the &quot;bin_ship&quot; folder where you installed the game.\n3. Click &quot;Select DAZIPs&quot; and select all 4 DAZIP files in this torrent.\n4. Highlight all the files in the list and click &quot;Install Selected&quot;\n5. Upon completion, run decrypt_all.bat from the &quot;DLC Decrypter&quot; folder of this torrent.\n6. Locate AddIns.xml in &quot;C:/Users/(Username)/Documents/Bioware/Dragon Age/Settings&quot; and edit it using WordPad or any \n\nXML editor. Replace all RequiresAuthorization=&quot;1&quot; with RequiresAuthorization=&quot;0&quot;.\n7. Run the game and check to see if everything worked!  Click &quot;Other Campaigns&quot; and the DLC should be visible and \n\nplayable.\n\nCheers!\n\nATTENTION: If you are getting an error while installing the DLC, it is most likely caused by a corrupt AddIns.xml.  \n\nNavigate to where it is located and delete both it AND Manifest.xml.  You will need to reinstall the Awakenings \n\nexpansion (if you have it) and any previous DLC.  This should solve your problem.  A simpler way to do this without \n\nhaving to install everything again is to make sure the encoding of AddIns.xml is set to UTF-8 rather than deleting the \n\ntwo XMLs.\n\nNOTE: The unique item can only be accessed after completing the mini-campaign and unlocking the relevant achievement.\n\nNOTE: This version of the DLC Decrypter will ONLY decrypt this DLC.  It is not a generic decryption tool and must be \n\nmodified to decrypt other DLC.\n\n-=-=Info=-=-\n\nNumber of files: 7\nTotal size: ~745 MB\n\n** Please seed until your ratio is at least 1.50.
