Jeremy and Scott walk along the beach in sunny California, looking for inspiration with no pre-determined shots in mind. This course is all about experimentation and being creative with the camera while using a minimal amount of equipment. During the lessons, Jeremy talks about composition, balancing light, working with photography assistants, and how he recognizes what the right images for his clients are. It does not matter what type of photographer you are, everyone will find inspiration in this course.\n\nLesson 01 Introduction (2:44)\nLesson 02 Reflected Metal (10:18)\nLesson 03 Negative Space (14:20)\nLesson 04 Layered Composition (7:26)\nLesson 05 Think Like an Art Director (3:09)\nLesson 06 Girl on the Rocks (6:50)\nLesson 07 Classic Beauty Shot (12:28)\nLesson 08 Vintage Bike (11:29)\nLesson 09 Beach Umbrella (7:58)\nLesson 10 Conclusion (3:08)\n\nTOTAL: 01:19:50\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaDbKaADm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaDbKaADm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8badfc1d19014969a21d1fc53c13b16cb75eec86","amp;dn":"Kelby+Training+-+On+Location+Photography+with+Jeremy+Cowart%2C+Par","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8badfc1d19014969a21d1fc53c13b16cb75eec86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,173,252,29,25,1,73,105,162,29,31,197,60,19,177,108,183,94,236,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
