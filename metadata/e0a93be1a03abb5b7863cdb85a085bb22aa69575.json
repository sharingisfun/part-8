Unfortunately this is rarely true but the true crime is the lack of goal setting within the pages of these other books. Growing The Money Tree is different - it does not aim to make the reader a millionaire, but rather shows them why they don't need to be a millionaire to be happy. Financial freedom is a lot closer than people may realize and Growing The Money Tree aspires to show the reader how close they really are. \n\nGrowing The Money Tree covers budgeting, goal setting, income analysis, a gentle introduction to the Forex market and the author's own tale of how he started trading the Forex, his trials and tribulations and how he came to understand the concept of growing my own money tree. The book includes some trading strategies that the author has developed over the years using a form of artificial intelligence known as genetic algorithms for those interested in a more advanced approach. \n\nGrowing The Money Tree wasn't written to make millionaires, it was written to share the author's experiences from trading the Forex over the past 12 years in order to show that through diversification and some simple money management, people can find financial freedom much sooner. \n\nSome testimonials the book has received include: \n\n&quot;I'm not an experienced trader, but this book has a very interesting approach to teaching you about Forex trading, especially if you're into programming. I loved how the author first goes through a 20-day trading example instead of just showing you how to read charts and interpret indicators from them, to later go through the idea of using Genetic Algorithms to automate trading. He even gives an example using code to better understand these types of algorithms. \n\nApart from that, he doesn't try to sell you anything, and reminds you that you should never invest everything into a single thing (ie. diversify your money!), finally telling you a little bit about how he began trading and what rookie mistakes you should avoid. \n\nDefinitely worth a read.&quot; -- Ian M. \n\n&quot;Growing the Money Tree is more than a book about FOREX. It's an introduction to investing in your financial future. As a new FOREX investor, I appreciated the well rounded approach, though there are other books that go deeper into specific subjects. I liked the melding of the FOREX market and algorithmic trading which I have not seen in other books. I did feel that the book had a Canadian perspective, though that did not interfere with the contents of the book. I especially liked the 20 Days of Trading which confirmed I was on the right track with my own experiences.&quot; -- Scott S.\n\nBy picking up Growing The Money Tree today, you get one step closer to realizing your own financial freedom by coming to terms with how close it actually is. The dream of vast wealth is still an amicable one, but finding happiness by breaking the work cycle can be found before this wealth is achieved. \n\nGrowing The Money Tree is not a get-rich-quick scheme nor does it promise vast amounts of wealth. Instead it focuses on coming to terms with monthly expenses, investment diversification, foreign exchange trading and a touch of artificial intelligence for the curious. By including a few chapters about the author's own personal journey he offers an insight to those who are new to the idea of taking control of their investments and help them avoid the trials he faced himself, both financially and psychologically, over the past 12 years. \n\nHappy growing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a93be1a03abb5b7863cdb85a085bb22aa69575","amp;dn":"%5BBook%5Dgrowing_the_money_tree","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a93be1a03abb5b7863cdb85a085bb22aa69575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,169,59,225,160,58,187,91,120,99,205,184,90,8,91,178,42,166,149,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
