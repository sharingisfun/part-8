Includes discussion topics and questions after each chapter.\n\n All in all, this book is an easy-to-use introduction to the distinguishing characteristics of Japanese society; an invaluable resource for anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€business people, travelers, or studentsÃ¢â‚¬â€perfect for course adoption, but also for anyone interested in Japanese culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9724764749f16e2eca09c385d1c4fadd700772b","amp;dn":"The+Japanese+Mind%3A+Understanding+Japanese+Culture+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9724764749f16e2eca09c385d1c4fadd700772b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,114,71,100,116,159,22,226,236,160,156,56,93,28,79,173,215,0,119,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
