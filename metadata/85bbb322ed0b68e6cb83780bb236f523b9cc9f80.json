Where his previous album found the often Anglophile-leaning artist imbuing his melodic pop with a kind of low-key psychedelia, here Costa keeps the old-school vibe going, but colors it with a softer, often '70s AM pop radio approach. That means we get a bit of country twang, some juicy organ sounds, and lots of shiny string and horn parts throughout the album. Cuts like rambling opener &quot;Loving You&quot; and the sparkling &quot;Shotgun&quot; bring together a mix of T. Rex's glitter rock and the pre-disco-era orchestral pop of Electric Light Orchestra. Elsewhere, the late-afternoon melancholy of &quot;Early November&quot; and the equally as ruminative folk-inflected &quot;Laura Lee,&quot; with their gold dust-covered vinyl aesthetic, sound like long lost Donovan songs. However, Costa is not merely a retro stylist; his songs are always personal, yet universally relatable with evocative, poetic lyrics that seem to come from a place deep in his soul. On &quot;Shotgun&quot; he sings &quot;I tried to find my own way in the books that I read/Found all my favorite authors, they're dead/Sometimes in your life you're gonna walk in a room/Everyone's invited but you.&quot; But perhaps Costa sums up the album's appeal best on &quot;Loving You,&quot; as he croons &quot;Loving you is not hard to do/We're always gonna make it through/You've got my attention/Here's my affection for you.&quot; With Matt Costa, Costa definitely has our attention and earns our affection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bbb322ed0b68e6cb83780bb236f523b9cc9f80","amp;dn":"Matt+Costa+-+Matt+Costa+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bbb322ed0b68e6cb83780bb236f523b9cc9f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,187,179,34,237,11,104,230,203,131,120,11,178,54,245,35,185,204,159,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
