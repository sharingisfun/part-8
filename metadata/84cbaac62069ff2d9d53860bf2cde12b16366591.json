It contains 69 highly informative technical papers presented at the Mei Lecture session and the technical sessions of the symposium. The Chinese Society of Engineering Thermophysics (CSET) organized the First, the Second and the Third International Symposium on Fluid Machinery and Fluid Engineering (1996, 2000 and 2004). The purpose of the 4th Symposium is to provide a common forum for exchange of scientific and technical information worldwide on fluid machinery and fluid engineering for scientists and engineers. The main subject of this symposium is &quot;Fluid Machinery for Energy Conservation&quot;. The &quot;Mei Lecture&quot; reports on the most recent developments of fluid machinery in commemoration of the late professor Mei Zuyan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84cbaac62069ff2d9d53860bf2cde12b16366591","amp;dn":"Fluid+Machinery+and+Fluid+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84cbaac62069ff2d9d53860bf2cde12b16366591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,203,170,198,32,105,255,45,157,83,134,11,242,205,225,43,22,54,101,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
