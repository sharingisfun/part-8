You can dl MythBusters here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3444602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3444602&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nI don&amp;#039;t want messeges concerning subs, there aren&amp;#039;t any in this torrent and I DON&amp;#039;T\nknow where to get them, so just learn english!\nDon&amp;#039;t msg me about &quot;i can&amp;#039;t play the files...&quot;, download VLC! (www.videolan.org)\nSeed atleast 1:1\nAnd don&amp;#039;t msg me about seeding if your dl averages around 20 KB/s\n\nif you have any other questions you are welcome to msg me @TPB :)\n\n\n\nSidenotes:\nHave in mind that not all you see on Brainiac is a 100% real.\nFor instance their TNT-sticks are hardly solid TNT, but more likely a small\namount of TNT inside a big shell (note the extremely small explosions).\nAnd I suspect that they sometimes augment certain explosions\nso that they look better on TV.\nWatch extra closely when they put a TNT-stick next to a cars tire and let Tina\nignite it - the car explodes from within it&amp;#039;s center (not from beside the tire).\nThere are more examples, but these are the most obvious.\n\nIf you want to buy Brainiac on DVD go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.skyoneshop.co.uk/ProductsInCounter.cfm?subcat=4601&amp;ShopRef=69&amp;cat=538&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.skyoneshop.co.uk/ProductsInCounter.cfm?subcat=4601&amp;ShopRef=69&amp;cat=538&lt;/a&gt;\nSo far only s01 is available and is priced at around $22 (Ã‚Â£13)\nwhich I think is a very good price. (compare to MB $20 per episode)\n\n\n-weezl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92e75283e8bc6553206b3019670efeae7b7e2e3","amp;dn":"Brainiac+-+science+abuse+-+ALL+eps+%28to+date%2C+2006-03-10%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92e75283e8bc6553206b3019670efeae7b7e2e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,46,117,40,62,139,198,85,50,6,179,1,150,112,239,234,231,183,226,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
