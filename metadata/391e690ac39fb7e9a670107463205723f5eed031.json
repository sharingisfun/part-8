Hong Gil Dong was the illegitimate son of a high ranked \nminister. A local monk took him under his wing and taught him martial arts. \nHong Gil Dong was inspired to fight for the injustice in this society that \ndivided people into nobles and ordinary citizens whereby the former enjoyed \nall the privileges due solely to their birth. The heroine, Heo Yi Nok, had \njust returned to Korea from China with her grandfather. They made their \nliving by putting on shows and selling their special brand of medicine in \nthe marketplace.
