The group formed in 2009 and began issuing releases in short order, including the Love on the Sea 12&quot; on Sick Thirst, which they followed with the Killing Time EP on Sacred Bones. Moon Duo made the jump to Woodsist for 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s full-length Escape, which offered the most expansive and melodic take on their trippy sounds yet. \n\n  After touring nearly incessantly following that release, Moon Duo moved their operation to the Souterrain Transmissions imprint in Berlin for Mazes later in the year, recording the set at home in San Francisco and mixing it in Germany. The album, released in the spring of 2011, followed widely acclaimed performances at SXSW; the band's sound on that record focused more on tightly written (and brightly produced) songs with fixed Motorik rhythms (there is no drummer). The set also got the remix treatment later in the year with participation from Psychic Ills, Purling Hiss, and Sonic Boom, to name a few. The band's next full-length, Circles, appeared in the fall of 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b628b131aa746a3334ac066533f3500e59aa6ce6","amp;dn":"Moon+Duo+-+Circles+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b628b131aa746a3334ac066533f3500e59aa6ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,40,177,49,170,116,106,51,52,172,6,101,51,243,80,14,89,170,108,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
