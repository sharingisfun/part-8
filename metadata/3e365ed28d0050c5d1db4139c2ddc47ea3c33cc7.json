Unlike his previous set, 2010Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Shadow of an Empire, this arrives\nwith relatively little fanfare, a result of the Bray-born singerÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retreat from\nthe mainstream five years on from his Mercury-nominated debut, The End of\nHistory. Said disc was an understated delight, but its follow-up favoured\namplification over introspection, and its troubled gestation produced an\nunderwhelming collection. But 100 Acres of Sycamore finds Regan returning to the\nacoustic prettiness of his first album, embellishments restricted to gently\nswelling strings rather than distracting bombast.\n\nReganÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focus has shifted Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ where he previously looked out onto the world from a\nlofty position in the indie-folk world, today heÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s back in the margins that once\nheld him so dearly. And heÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable here, operating at a commercial level\nbelow that of fellow Mercury nominee (and Brit-winner) Laura Marling, and thus\nable to write without the pressure that those in the spotlight have to endure.\n100 Acres of Sycamore is an unhurried set that makes its point lightly, without\nbluster. Recorded overseas, in a Spanish villa owned by the actress Anna Friel,\nitÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of a wistfulness that perhaps wouldnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have manifested had this been\nproduced in more familiar surroundings. The speed of its capture Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ straight to\ntape in just seven days Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ results in a freshness that evokes ReganÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine EPs\nfor the Anvil label, Reservoir and Hotel Room. This is the sound of an artist\nreturning to his roots in the right way Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ for personal gratification rather than\ncommercial gain.\n\nSuch is the intimacy throughout this album Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ though the strings are full, they\nnever overpower the simple set-up of reflective lyrics and strummed guitar Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ\nthat one feels a direct connection with the artist, on an\nindividual-to-individual level. Regan was singing for himself, honest and\nsincere, when recording these tracks; and with his voice in a pair of\nheadphones, the listener is transported to the Majorcan residence the Irishman\nfound so conducive to crafting album three. ItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fine body of work, the kind\nof album that doesnÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t benefit from having highlights lifted from it. True, there\nare songs that beguile with the sort of laidback beauty that so few indie-folk\nperformers are capable of producing Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 1st Day of May, lead single For a\nNightingale, the echo-soaked (and over-too-soon) closer Golden Light (imagine\nBradford Cox going country) Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€œ but this is a collection best heard as the artist\nintended: in the order presented, without compromise. That warmth youÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re feeling\ncome its close, try to hold onto it. ItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a contentment few albums leave you\nwith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e365ed28d0050c5d1db4139c2ddc47ea3c33cc7","amp;dn":"Fionn_Regan-100_Acres_Of_Sycamore-2011-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e365ed28d0050c5d1db4139c2ddc47ea3c33cc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,54,94,210,141,0,80,197,209,219,65,57,194,221,196,126,163,195,60,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
