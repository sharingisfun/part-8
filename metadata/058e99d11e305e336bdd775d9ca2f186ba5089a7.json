It presents the most important approaches to the analysis of time series, which may be stationary or nonstationary. Modelling and forecasting univariate time series is the starting point. For multiple stationary time series, Granger causality tests and vector autogressive models are presented. As the modelling of nonstationary uni- or multivariate time series is most important for real applied work, unit root and cointegration analysis as well as vector error correction models are a central topic. Tools for analysing nonstationary data are then transferred to the panel framework. Modelling the (multivariate) volatility of financial time series with autogressive conditional heteroskedastic models is also treated.\n\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:058e99d11e305e336bdd775d9ca2f186ba5089a7","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Modern+Time+Series+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"058e99d11e305e336bdd775d9ca2f186ba5089a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,142,153,209,30,48,94,51,107,221,119,93,156,162,241,134,186,80,137,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
