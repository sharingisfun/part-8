But about just over half of the tracks are 12 inch versions and in the case of Fantastic Day, a live version, so if you are after the single or album versions, look elsewhere.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a100c82910e66e6ebf97991847074b1b29aa8a","amp;dn":"The+Greatest+Hits+of+Nick+Heyward+%26+Haircut+100","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a100c82910e66e6ebf97991847074b1b29aa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,161,0,200,41,16,230,110,110,191,151,153,24,71,7,75,27,41,170,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
