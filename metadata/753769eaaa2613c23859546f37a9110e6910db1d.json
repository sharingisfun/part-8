Their beginnings can be traced back to the late 1960s. The band played an important role in the development of speed and thrash metal, being part of the German heavy metal scene, which emerged in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nFollowing their disbandment in 1997 and short-lived reunion in 2005, Accept reunited again in 2009 with former T.T. Quick frontman Mark Tornillo replacing Dirkschneider and released their two highest charting albums to date, Blood of the Nations and Stalingrad. They have sold over 17 million albums worldwide.\n\n\nAccept At MySpace\n\nimage\n\n\n\n2015 Heavy Ballads (Compilation)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 1:\n\n01. Falls Of The Empire\n\n02.
