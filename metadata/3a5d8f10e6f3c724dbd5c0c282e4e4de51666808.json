Narrating as &quot;we,&quot; the Jamisons bring readers along as they dig into succulent jumbo crab at a hole in the wall in Singapore, dine on a luxurious wood and rattan houseboat in India and tour wineries in Australia; unfortunately, the spell is occasionally broken by awkward lapses into third person. That aside, the Jamisons make for informative and inquisitive travel guides, seeking out lesser-known establishments that capture the feel of each country. Though they occasionally splurge on an upscale meal, the majority of their dining experiences are well within the budgets of most travelers.
