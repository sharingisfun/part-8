Three Pieces for Orchestra\n\n\nComposed By: Alban Berg\nConductor: Claudio Abbado\nOrchestra: The London Symphony Orchestra\nProducer: Karl Faust\nSoprano Vocals: Margaret Price (tracks: 3, 5, 9 to 13)\nNotes: Recorded in December 1970, Anvill Films Studio, England.\n\n\nTotal time: 1:06:32\n\n\nThese are among the most sheerly beautiful performances of Berg's music ever recorded, the textures exquisitely balanced, the string playing suavely refined, the Mahlerian elegiac passages eloquently expressed. Margaret Price sings with immaculate purity, a little earnestly, perhaps, in Lulu's song, but with fine responsiveness to the subtly chiselled lines of the Altenberg songs (of which, by the way, this is the only currently available recording). Abbado's readings have great energy (the two Lulu entr'actes are powerfully dramatic) and are acutely alive to the iridescent shiftings both of instrumental colour and of expressive intensity that are so characteristic of Berg (thus Abbado, too, is at his very finest in the elusive, evanescent Altenberg songs). Boniness and edginess are in rather shorter supplyÃ¢â‚¬â€ something of pungency is lacking from the Lulu music, the fearsome March of op. 6 is not so terrifying an onslaught as it can beÃ¢â‚¬â€but this is a record whose alluring sumptuousness would convert the most cautious agnostic to a belief in Berg's genius and I am grateful for its return. \n(Gramophone.net).\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nLulu Suite (1929-1934) - Symphonic Pieces From The Opera &quot;Lulu&quot;\n1 Rondo: Andante (Introduzione) - Hymne: Sostenuto 15:10 \n2 Ostinato: Allegro 3:25 \n3 Lied Der Lulu: Comodo 2:56 \n4 Variationen: Moderato (Grandioso - Grazioso - FunÃƒÂ¨bre - Affettuoso) 3:24 \n5 Adagio: Sostenuto - Lento - Grave 8:55 \nThree Pieces For Orchestra Op. 6 (1914-1915) (Revised Version Of 1929)\n6 PrÃƒÂ¤ludium: Langsam 4:56 \n7 Reigen: Anfangs Etwas ZÃƒÂ¶gernd - Leicht Beschwingt 5:48 \n8 Marsch: MÃƒÂ¤ssiges Marschtempo 9:48 \nFive Orchestral Songs Op. 4 To Picture-Postcard Texts By Peter Altenberg (1912)\n9 Seele, Wie Bist Du SchÃƒÂ¶ner 2:52 \n10 Sahst Du Nach Dem Gewitterregen Den Wald 1:08 \n11 ÃƒÅ“ber Die Grenzen Des All 1:37 \n12 Nichts Ist Gekommen 1:32 \n13 Hier Ist Friede 4:29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fe9c51c0b6672d3b72e7465a9251d3c797ef80","amp;dn":"Alban+Berg+-+Lulu-Suite+-+Orchesterstucke+-+Orchesterlieder+%5BFLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fe9c51c0b6672d3b72e7465a9251d3c797ef80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,254,156,81,192,182,103,45,59,114,231,70,90,146,81,211,199,151,239,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
