This shockingly imaginative original Canadian series candidly chronicles first-person accounts of UFO sightings, alien encounters and abductions. In each episode, dramatic reenactments recount stunning real-life unexplained alien experiences, taking viewers on a thrilling - and sometimes terrifying - journey. Their bizarre, life-altering encounters are vividly depicted using new state-of-the-art CGI and green screen techniques and created by Toronto-based Acme Digital Pictures. As well, each story features scientists and researchers who probe the question - how is this possible?\n\nDiscovery's Alien Mysteries is a fantastically creative and imaginative new take on some of the most enduring UFO mysteries from the last 50 years. Each story is backed up by credible witnesses, investigative reports, and tangible evidence such as physical markings, photographs, radar reports, and videos.\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nEpisode 4 is NOT in High Definition but IS INCLUDED\nFile Types: Mkv aka Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nAir Date: 2013\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/2348/lin0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/2348/lin0.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/8036/pbzo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/8036/pbzo.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/273/uoyx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/273/uoyx.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7299/3scq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7299/3scq.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5095/eaiv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5095/eaiv.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discovery.ca/showpage.aspx?sid=49594&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discovery.ca/showpage.aspx?sid=49594&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Link:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2648204/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2648204/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Mysteries_(Canadian_documentary)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Mysteries_(Canadian_documentary)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTvRage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-34879&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-34879&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as KILLERS, IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, KILLERS, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\nBackups and other CARG Releases can be found at ExtraTorrent, KickassTorrent and The Pirate Bay\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f89844c25f428732a6103d97599b10f96eaf7f6","amp;dn":"Discovery+Channel+Alien+Mysteries+Season+1+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f89844c25f428732a6103d97599b10f96eaf7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,137,132,76,37,244,40,115,42,97,3,217,117,153,177,15,150,234,247,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
