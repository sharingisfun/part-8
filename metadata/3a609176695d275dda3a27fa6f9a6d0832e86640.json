Hailed :\n : by the New York Times as &quot;single-handedly responsible for what's been      :\n : called the cocktail renaissance,&quot; he earned this reputation during his     :\n : twelve years at the fashionable Promenade Bar in New York City's Rainbow   :\n : Room. It was there in 1987 that he not only reintroduced the cocktail menu :\n : to the country but also began mixing drinks from scratch, using impeccably :\n : fresh ingredients instead of the widespread mixes used at the time. Known  :\n : especially for crafting unique cocktails, reviving classics, and coaxing   :\n : superior flavor from his ingredients, DeGroff has selected his 100         :\n : essential drinks and 100 of their best variations--including many of his   :\n : signature cocktails--for this premier mixology guide.                      :\n :                                                                            :\n : The Essential Cocktail features only those drinks that stand out for their :\n : flavor, interesting formula, or distinctive technique. These are the very  :\n : ones every amateur and professional bartender must know, the martinis,     :\n : sours, highballs, tropicals, punches, sweets, and classics, both old and   :\n : new, that form the core of a connoisseur's repertoire. Throughout the book :\n : are DeGroff's personal twists, such as a tangy Grapefruit Julep or a       :\n : refreshing Yuzu Gimlet.                                                    :\n :                                                                            :\n : To complement the tantalizing photographs of each essential cocktail,      :\n : DeGroff also regales readers with the fascinating lore behind a drink's    :\n : genesis and instructs us on using the right ingredients, techniques,       :\n : glasses, and garnishes. As Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French       :\n : Cooking was the classic compendium for home chefs and gourmands, so The    :\n : Essential Cocktail will be the go-to book for serious mixologists and      :\n : cocktail enthusiasts.                                                      :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a609176695d275dda3a27fa6f9a6d0832e86640","amp;dn":"Dale+Degroff+The+Essential+Cocktail+2010+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a609176695d275dda3a27fa6f9a6d0832e86640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,96,145,118,105,93,39,93,218,58,39,250,111,154,109,8,50,232,102,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
