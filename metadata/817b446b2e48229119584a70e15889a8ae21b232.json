Series 1\r\n\r\nNature Documentary hosted by Usher Raymond, published by Discovery Channel in 2016 - English narration\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/22/Hello-World-Series-1-Cover.jpg\r\n\r\nInformation\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nHello World! Series 1\r\nPresented in association with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Hello World! is a six-part series taking a look at the wonders of the natural world through the eyes of some of today's most celebrated musicians. The series brings out the universal themes of the artists' music by using it as a soundtrack for the stories of animals in the wild.\r\nHello World! Takes viewers deep into the environments of animals as varied as sea turtles, jumping spiders, rhinos, and hawks as they live their daily lives. Whether they are searching for water, looking for love, or caring for their families, these animals all have a singular way of surviving. Each episode features the artist's vibrant storytelling and one of their well-known songs, as well as a lush musical score.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  &quot;Stronger&quot; with Usher Raymond \r\nIt's a big, tough world out there, where animals face harsh environments and voracious predators. Usher's new track &quot;Stronger,&quot; also the title of the episode, provides the backdrop as the sea turtle and red fox demonstrate how adversity only makes them more resilient.\r\n\r\n2)  &quot;Don't Mess with Mama&quot; with Christina Aguilera \r\nA mother's love is something so fierce that anyone who gets in her way better beware. In &quot;Don't Mess with Mama,&quot; Aguilera uses &quot;Light up the Sky&quot; to showcase the strategies of such strong maternal caregivers as a mountain goat and a cheetah, as each protects her young.\r\n\r\n3)  &quot;Summer Wild&quot; with Steven Tyler \r\nTyler's recently released country song &quot;Red, White &amp; You&quot; is a perfect backdrop to &quot;Summer Wild.&quot; This episode shows how several North American critters-prairie dogs, hawks, and wild mustangs like to spend their summer vacation.\r\n\r\n4)  &quot;Crazy Love&quot; with Ellie Goulding \r\nIn &quot;Crazy Love,&quot; Goulding uncovers the amazing (and hilarious) lengths some animals go to too attract a mate. Her hit, &quot;Something in the Way You Move,&quot; sets the mood for animals as diverse as polar bears and garter snakes.\r\n\r\n5)  &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; with Joan Jett \r\nOur favorite bad girl, Jett, highlights the stories of many of the creatures we love to hate. Featuring wolves, alligators, and sharks, &quot;Bad Reputation,&quot; featuring the hit song of the same name, makes the case that for all the fear they put into the world, these guys might just be getting a bad rap. And more than that, they each are really a crucial part of their native ecosystem.\r\n\r\n6)  &quot;Save Me&quot; with Dave Matthews \r\nJust about every animal needs water. Yet each creature's search for it is unique. With &quot;Save Me,&quot; Matthews follows the stories of three very different species -- rhinos, spadefoot toads, and manatees -- as they search for the fresh water on which all life on Earth depends.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4c/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/00/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Hello-World-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~4397 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 384 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 22 mins\r\n * Framerate: 29.412 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mkv\r\n * Part Size: 693 MB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/hello-world/about-the-show/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:817b446b2e48229119584a70e15889a8ae21b232","amp;dn":"Hello.World.Series.1.1of6.Stronger.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"817b446b2e48229119584a70e15889a8ae21b232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,123,68,107,46,72,34,145,25,88,74,112,225,88,137,168,174,33,178,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
