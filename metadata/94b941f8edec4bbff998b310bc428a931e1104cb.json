Not until this summer, when one went too far. No way will she let the same thing happen to her little sister.\n\nKat is tired of the rumours, the insults, the cruel jokes. It all goes back to one personÃ¢â‚¬â€œ her ex-best friendÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and she's ready to make her pay.\n\nFour years ago, Mary left Jar Island because of a boy. But she's not the same girl anymore. And she's ready to prove it to him.\n\nThree very different girls who want the same thing: sweet, sweet revenge. And they won't stop until they each had a taste.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b941f8edec4bbff998b310bc428a931e1104cb","amp;dn":"Burn+for+Burn+-+Jenny+Han","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94b941f8edec4bbff998b310bc428a931e1104cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,185,65,248,237,236,75,191,249,152,179,16,188,66,138,147,30,17,4,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
