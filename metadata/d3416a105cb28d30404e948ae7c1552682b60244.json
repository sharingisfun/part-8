The overbearing, self-centered celebrity soon comes to dominate the lives of the residents and everyone else who enters the household. He encourages young adults Richard and June Stanley to pursue their dreams, much to the dismay of their conventional father Ernest.\n\nMeanwhile, Whiteside's spinster assistant Maggie Cutler finds herself attracted to local newspaperman Bert Jefferson. When she reads Bert's play, she is so impressed she asks Whiteside to show it to his contacts, and then announces she will quit his employment and marry Bert. However, her boss is loath to lose such an efficient aide and does his best to sabotage the blossoming romance. He suggests actress Lorraine Sheldon would be perfect for one of the leading roles, intending to have her steal Bert away from Maggie. Lorraine convinces Bert to spend time with her to fix up the play. When Maggie realizes Whiteside is behind the underhanded scheme, she quits. Somewhat chastened, Whiteside concocts a plan to get Lorraine out of the way, with the help of his friend Banjo. They trap Lorraine in a sarcophagus, and Banjo ships her off to Nova Scotia.\n\nFinally fed up with Whiteside's shenanigans, insults, and unbearable personality, Mr. Stanley orders him to leave. Before he does, Whiteside blackmails him into allowing his children to do as they please by threatening to reveal Stanley's sister Harriet's past as an infamous axe murderess. As Whiteside departs, he falls on the icy steps again and is carried back inside, much to Stanley's consternation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3416a105cb28d30404e948ae7c1552682b60244","amp;dn":"The+man+who+came+to+dinner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3416a105cb28d30404e948ae7c1552682b60244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,65,106,16,92,178,141,48,64,78,148,138,231,193,85,38,130,182,2,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
