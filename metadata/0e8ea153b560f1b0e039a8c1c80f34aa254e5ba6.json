So I remade the ripping from the DVDs with two pass encoding and applying inverse-telecine algorithms. \n\nMy upload speed is pretty slow, but I intend to keep seeding.\n\n\nMore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sam_%26_Max:_Freelance_Police\nDVD: http://www.telltalegames.com/store/snmanimated-dvd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e8ea153b560f1b0e039a8c1c80f34aa254e5ba6","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Sam+%60n%60+Max%3A+Freelance+Police","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e8ea153b560f1b0e039a8c1c80f34aa254e5ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,142,161,83,181,96,241,176,224,57,168,193,200,15,52,170,37,78,91,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
