As with many other outfits, they left school to fully concentrate on their new band.\n\nThe origins of the band's name trace back to the Hebrew language. The word daath means knowledge, a superior, not-easy-to-attain knowledge. In the words of co-founder Mike Kameron, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn a mental level, DAATH acts as a doorway between instinct and intellect, and in our opinion the struggle between those two aspects of mind is what causes most of the ills in the world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (quote taken from the band's website.)\n\nDAATH's first album, &quot;Futility&quot;, was released in 2004, to a good reception from the music world. The album was independently produced by the band. Previously, they had released a single called &quot;Child Says/Filter&quot;.\n\nAfter getting signed by Roadrunner Records, DAATH went to the studio to begin writing for their sophomore opus. They released a single (&quot;Ovum&quot;), in 2006. In 2007 the band's second full-length, &quot;The Hinderers&quot;, saw the light. It was received with praise by the metal community.\n\nDAATH's music fuses elements of death, thrash, and black metal with elements of industrial music and with technical virtuosity and song complexity proper of progressive metal. According to the band, DAATH have a lot of influences that range from Gustave Mahler to the Doors to Aphex Twin, of course going over death and thrash metal masters. &quot;I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re traditional death metal. I would say that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re progressive extreme music. We draw from various styles of extreme music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ death, black, doom, whateverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ we throw in electronica, we throw in orchestral, we throw in some classic rock. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re definitely not sticking to death metal. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not limiting it. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re always trying to grow, and we already decided which aspects of our sound we want to emphasize more. Our goal is to add new elements with each record, and hopefully weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll always be doing something that people like.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Eyal Levi, quoted in the band's website.)\n\nThis Discography includes the following albums:\n\nFutility (2004)\nThe Hinderers (2007)\nThe Concealers (2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f3b2f957c374eb1825aadc2affce97b1935417b","amp;dn":"Daath+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f3b2f957c374eb1825aadc2affce97b1935417b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,59,47,149,124,55,78,177,130,90,173,194,175,252,233,123,25,53,65,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
