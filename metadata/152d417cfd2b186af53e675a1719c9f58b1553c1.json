Louis is visiting for three weeks and is staying with his mother's friend Marcelle while awaiting the return of his expectant mother. The girl befriends the boy and has decided to share her secrets with him during their summer adventure together. The boy learns to overcome the many challenges he's faced with.\n\nDiscover how the young man not only personally transforms, but also has a healing influence on the childless couple that he's staying with.\n\nAnd don't be deceived. This is not a children's film. Sure, a large part of it is about that feeling of discovery as a youth, but it is so much more. You will see the children's perspective of the adults, the adults perspective of the children, the children's perspective of the children, and the adults perspective of the adults.\n\nThis film ranks among my favorite French films such as Jean de Florette, Manon des sources, and Le chÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢teau de ma mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe hardcoded English subtitles have been meticulously synchronized and are easy to read due to size and placement.\n\n===================================================================================\n\n\n\nCodec: DIVX\n\nVideo: 704 x 432\n\n25 frame rate\n\n837 kbit/sec\n\nAudio: 2 channel\n\n48K Hz\n\n96 kb/s\n\nTime: 1:42:25","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152d417cfd2b186af53e675a1719c9f58b1553c1","amp;dn":"Le+grand+chemin+-+The+Grand+Highway.French.%5B1987%5D.hardsubs.ENG.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152d417cfd2b186af53e675a1719c9f58b1553c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,45,65,124,253,43,24,106,245,62,103,90,23,25,201,245,139,21,83,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
