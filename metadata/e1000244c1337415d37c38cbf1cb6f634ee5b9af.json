She's browsed in a bookstore, finding a blood-red-covered novel, a murder mystery with numerology that loops constantly around the number 23. The story captivates Walter: he dreams it, he notices aspects of his life that can be rendered by &quot;23,&quot; he searches for the author, he stays in the hotel (in room 23) where events in the novel took place, and he begins to believe it was no novel. His wife and son try to help him, sometimes in sympathy, sometimes to protect him. Slowly, with danger to himself and to his family, he closes in on the truth.\n\n\nName\t                 Source\tTarget\nAudio Codec\t          dts\tmp2\nAudio SampleRate(hz)\t48000\t44100\nAudio Bitrate(bps)\t          0\t128000\nAudio Channels\t     5.1 Channels\tStereo\nVideo Codec\t     mpeg2video\tmpeg2video\nVideo Size(pix)\t     1920*1080\t720*480\nVideo Bitrate(kbps)\t0\t3000\nVideo FrameRate(fps)\t23.976\t29.97\nFile Size\t\t2.18GB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1000244c1337415d37c38cbf1cb6f634ee5b9af","amp;dn":"The+Number+23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1000244c1337415d37c38cbf1cb6f634ee5b9af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,0,2,68,193,51,116,21,211,124,56,203,241,203,111,99,78,229,185,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
