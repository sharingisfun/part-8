Originally developed by Joseph H. Pilates to help strengthen and condition muscles, Pilates is the ultimate mind-body exercise for anyone who wants to tone, streamline, and realign their body without the bulked-up results of more conventional workout methods.\n\nNow, in The PilatesÃ‚Â® Body, author Brooke Siler--one of the most sought-after personal trainers in the country and owner of New York's top studio for Pilates training, re:AB--provides a complete, easy-to follow program of Pilates exercises that can be done anywhere, anytime, and without machines.\n\nWith step-by-step instructions, Siler guides the reader through the complete circuit of mat exercises, each of which is clearly illustrated by photographs, line drawings, and unique visualization exercises. With Pilates you will not only streamline your figure--you will dramatically improve your posture, flexibility, and balance, and enhance your physical and emotional well-being. The Pilates Body shows you how.\n\nPaperback: 208 pages\nPublisher: Harmony; 1 edition (January 4, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 076790396X\nISBN-13: 978-0767903967\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a777be2aff0de62a34e5ef54cfebfd36d21e90","amp;dn":"The+Pilates+Body+by+Siler+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a777be2aff0de62a34e5ef54cfebfd36d21e90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,167,119,190,42,255,13,230,42,52,229,239,84,207,235,253,54,210,30,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
