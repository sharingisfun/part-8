So a few brave but ordinary souls are trailblazing what could be the solution for all of us - trying to build their own house from scratch. Architectural journalist and critic Kieran Long and award-winning architect Piers Taylor are following self-builders as they take on the biggest gamble of their lives. Kieran and Piers will try to help them create the house they've longed for. But all have less than Ã‚Â£100k to spend, little or no experience and life savings on the line - it won't be easy.\n\n\n1)  Martin \nJournalist and curator Kieran Long and architect Piers Taylor follow the progress of people choosing to build a property rather than buy one. Martin Whyment saved enough money from his pizza van business to buy a site in the centre of Leeds to build his first home, but when the bank refused him a mortgage he asked his parents to lend him their own hard-earned nest egg. Kieran and Piers are keen to help him achieve his dream, but with his mum and dad's cash at stake they have an extra responsibility to navigate him away from making costly mistakes.\n\n2)  Sumati \nTwice-widowed Sumati Bala thought she'd found the perfect spot to spend the rest of her life, a Northumberland cottage in need of renovation just outside Berwick-upon-Tweed. After moving in, serious problems including asbestos and rising damp emerged and she was left with no option but to knock down her home and build a new one in its place with just Ã‚Â£50,000 left of her savings. To help Sumati make the most of her incredibly tight budget, Kieran Long and Piers Taylor attempt to steer her in the right direction.\n\n3)  Ruth and Tony \nJournalist and curator Kieran Long and architect Piers Taylor follow the progress of Ruth and Tony, who hope to transform their crumbling Shropshire farmhouse on a tight budget. With costs spiralling out of control and an entire wing of the building scrapped to keep the project afloat, Kieran and Piers try to steer the construction in the right direction, but severe winter weather presents another challenge.\n\n4)  Tom and Zoe \nJournalist and curator Kieran Long and architect Piers Taylor follow the progress of Tom and Zoe, who have opted to buy a plot of land on a Cambridgeshire housing estate and build their own home. Piers tries to prove that by removing walls and abandoning a whole bedroom they will save money and make the property unique, while Kieran suggests sourcing inexpensive items from the high street and customising them into bespoke pieces.\n\n5)  Jane and Andy \nLeaving behind their conventional city-housing, Jane and Andy have bought a plot of land in an eco community in west Wales, where they can build their own home and enjoy a self-sufficient lifestyle. Piers Taylor tries to find solutions that could help push the project along - even suggesting using parts of a 747 jet - while Kieran Long investigates the pros and cons of sustainable building when he visits award-winning environmentally friendly homes.\n\n6)  Justin and Mary \nJustin and Mary are planning to build a Ã‚Â£95,000 home in rural Devon, but Kieran Long worries the newly engaged couple have taken on too much when he discovers they only have Ã‚Â£60,000 to their names. Exploring some of the UK's finest examples of low-cost housing, he aims to prove it is possible for the pair to fulfil their dreams on a budget, while Piers Taylor encourages them to be more adventurous and incorporate unique architectural features. However, with the pressure of organising a wedding and working full-time job, the build soon falls behind schedule.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2272/iqta.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/2272/iqta.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/5126/3xtr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/5126/3xtr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4651/86sl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/4651/86sl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8199/xy26.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/8199/xy26.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/2797/wvy4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/2797/wvy4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/9760/txie.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/9760/txie.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/3638/au7x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/3638/au7x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/173/pz2y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/173/pz2y.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6397/t3nm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6397/t3nm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9818/o6ef.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9818/o6ef.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9702/7jbi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/9702/7jbi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8380/u5ld.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8380/u5ld.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4d002c24230d017e637d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1635 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832x468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: average 690 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03bjqk4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03bjqk4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dabcb9619de30264200ea2ba5877b61872112742","amp;dn":"BBC+The+House+That+100k+Built+3of6+Ruth+and+Tony+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dabcb9619de30264200ea2ba5877b61872112742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,188,185,97,157,227,2,100,32,14,162,186,88,119,182,24,114,17,39,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
