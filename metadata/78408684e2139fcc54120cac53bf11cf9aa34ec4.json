Ninou was deported to Greece along with all the other Greeks in Smyrna when she was only seven years old, and a few years later, her parents started a career as a musician and a singer in a nightclub/bar. In the short space of one decade, Ninou witnesses her father murder her mother, runs away from home, has a baby, and comes back to the nightclub to sing in an act with a childhood friend and a bouzouki player, Babis. Success finally comes big-time, but then Ninou's childhood friend is exiled for political reasons, and she and Babis leave for other venues. Although Ninou carries a torch for Babis, their relationship never seems to work out, and after many years and World War II go by, she sends her daughter away to a convent school and goes on a tour in America. At last, her fame may spread beyond the boundaries of Greece -- or so it seems. Sotiria Leonardou won the prize for &quot;Best Actress&quot; at the 1983 Thessaloniki Film Festival, for her portrayal of Ninou, and the film itself tied for &quot;Best Picture,&quot; and won three other awards as well (two &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot; prizes, and one for music). \n---------------------------------------\nTechnical Details\n---------------------------------------\nDirector Costas Ferris\nCertificate 12 years and over\nYear 1983\nScreen Widescreen 1.78:1\nLanguages Greek - Dolby Digital (5.1)\nSubtitles English\nDuration 2 Hours and 28 minutes (approx)\nRegion Region 2\n---------------------------------------\nSpecial Features / Extras\n---------------------------------------\nAustralia Released PAL/NTSC Region 0 DVD \nTrailer(s) \nScene Access \nInteractive Menu \nDeleted Scenes\n---------------------------------------\nActors\n---------------------------------------\nSotiria Leonardou, Nikos Kalogeropoulos, Michalis Maniatis, Themis Bazaka, Nikos Dimitratos, Giorgos Zorbas, Konstantinos Tzoumas, Vicky Vanita, Vaso Alexandridou &amp; Nikolas Asimos\n---------------------------------------\nGenre\n---------------------------------------\nDokumentary\t\n---------------------------------------\nLabel\n---------------------------------------\nRembetiko [1983 PAL DVD][El Subs[En]\n---------------------------------------\nInformation pÃƒÂ¥ svenska \n---------------------------------------\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78408684e2139fcc54120cac53bf11cf9aa34ec4","amp;dn":"Rembetiko+%5B1983+PAL+DVD%5D%5BEl+Subs%5BEn%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78408684e2139fcc54120cac53bf11cf9aa34ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,64,134,132,226,19,159,204,84,18,12,172,83,191,17,207,154,163,78,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
