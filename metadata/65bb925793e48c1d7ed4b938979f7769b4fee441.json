A drop of milk? A spoonful of poison? At first sight, nothing would make the very select club called Green Manor stand out from any other English club. Yet behind its thick walls, sunk into its deep chairs, hides the biggest bunch of con artists, bandits and murderers that Queen Victoria's England has ever seen. Expresso Collection brings together stories published in one or two volumes by CINEBOOK. Single or Double, Cinebook proposes to savour the best European Graphic novels selected for connoisseurs. Green Manor is a Cinebook Double Expresso.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65bb925793e48c1d7ed4b938979f7769b4fee441","amp;dn":"Green_Manor+%282008%29cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65bb925793e48c1d7ed4b938979f7769b4fee441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,187,146,87,147,228,140,29,126,212,185,56,151,159,119,105,180,254,228,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
