The restÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½96 percent of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is completely unknown.\n\n Richard Panek tells the dramatic story of how scientists reached this cosmos-shattering conclusion, and what theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing to find this &quot;dark&quot; matter and an even more bizarre substance called dark energy. This is perhaps the greatest mystery in all of science, and solving it will bring fame, funding, and certainly a Nobel Prize. Based on in-depth, on-site reporting and hundreds of interviewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“with everyone from BerkeleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feisty Saul Perlmutter and Johns HopkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s meticulous Adam Riess to the quietly revolutionary Vera RubinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the book offers an intimate portrait of the bitter rivalries and fruitful collaborations, the eureka moments and blind alleys, that have fueled their search, redefined science, and reinvented the universe.\n\n The stakes couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be higher. Our view of the cosmos is profoundly wrong, and Copernicus was only the beginning: not just Earth, but all common matter is a marginal part of existence. PanekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fast-paced narrative, filled with behind-the-scenes details, brings this epic story to life for the very first time\n\nJanuary 2011\nPublisher: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt\nFormat: Hardcover  297pp\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1663fc074b84545b458a42ca6ef04ef265a6505","amp;dn":"The+4+Percent+Universe%3A+Dark+Matter%2C+Dark+Energy+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1663fc074b84545b458a42ca6ef04ef265a6505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,102,63,192,116,184,69,69,180,88,164,44,166,239,4,239,38,90,101,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
