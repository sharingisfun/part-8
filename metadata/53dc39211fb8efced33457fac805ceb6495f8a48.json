I couldn't find it anywhere else when I looked. I BOUGHT this album and I HIGHLY encourage you to buy it too--the work here is simply incredible and as somebody who has met Papadosio many times, I can say they are incredible people and deserve to be paid for their work.\n\nI came to the conclusion that music this spiritual and uplifting simply needs to be spread. So without further adieu, I present Papadosio's latest album, TETIOS-To End the Illusion of Separation, in flac.\n*note-this does not include the visionary artwork--one for each song--because you should BUY THE ALBUM and you will then receive all of the amazing artwork that accompanies this masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53dc39211fb8efced33457fac805ceb6495f8a48","amp;dn":"Papadosio-TETIOS+%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53dc39211fb8efced33457fac805ceb6495f8a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,220,57,33,31,184,239,206,211,52,87,250,200,5,206,182,73,95,138,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
