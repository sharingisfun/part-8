It offers process priority optimization, CPU core affinity optimization, power plan automation, automated rules, and so much more; you name it (within this area), and Process Lasso does it!\r\n\r\nItâ€™s most popular feature is the unique process optimization technology called ProBalance (Process Balance) that will improve your PCâ€™s responsiveness and stability by making intelligent dynamic adjustments to the priority class and/or CPU affinity of problematic background processes.\r\n\r\nProBalance will intelligently adjust process priorities and CPU affinities to positively impact the responsiveness of any Windows PC and/or Server (all Windows Server variants).\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n Keep Windows PCs responsive during high CPU loads with ProBalance\r\n Optimize and automate process CPU affinities\r\n Optimize and automate process CPU priority classes\r\n Optimize and automate process I/O priority classes\r\n Optimize and automate other process settings\r\n Limit hyper-threaded core use\r\n Disallow processes from running\r\n Limit number of instances of a process (even per-user)\r\n Log and audit process activity\r\n Auto-restart processes\r\n Broad CPU compatibility (SMP, NUMA)\r\n Monitor PC Responsiveness /w our proprietary algorithm\r\n Light-weight native C++ code with negligible resource use\r\n Efficient stand-alone core engine that can run as a service\r\n Separate Graphical User Interface goes into sleep mode when minimized, or can be closed completely\r\n Does NOT inject hooks anywhere outside itself or change persistent system settings\r\n INI configuration for easy on-demand changes\r\n Unattended install and headless operation\r\n Extensive Documentation\r\n Quick Start Guide for Audiophile Servers\r\n Compatible with all Windows Server variants!\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: https://bitsum.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081816a5fea08a7ae6bcbd185f5b2e163f326d30","amp;dn":"Bitsum+Process+Lasso+Pro+v8.9.8.38","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081816a5fea08a7ae6bcbd185f5b2e163f326d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,24,22,165,254,160,138,122,230,188,189,24,95,91,46,22,63,50,109,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
