Information is divided into nine sections, beginning with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œObserving the Universe,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which covers a definition of space, a history of viewing the stars, telescopes, and observatories. Other chapters include ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Violent Universe,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSolar System,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEarth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Moon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Sun.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLiftoffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features information on space shuttles, satellites, and rockets. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHumans in SpaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ discusses our exploration of the universe (animals in space, space stations, and the future of space exploration). A final ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStars and StargazingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ section describes stars, other solar systems, and what you can see in the night sky. \n\nWithin each section, topics are examined on two-page spreads featuring a typical DK layout: title, large-font introductory paragraph, several medium-sized-font paragraphs of supporting information, and numerous photographs with captions that provide additional details. Though there is plenty of detail to keep would-be astronauts engaged, the illustrative material is obviously the highlight of this volume. \n\nThe stunning full-color photographs and visuals, courtesy of NASA and high-tech telescopes from around the world, show detail and clarity. This work will find popularity with space enthusiasts and browsers alike, although report writers will need additional research sources if focusing on only one topic.\n\nI FOUND THIS BOOK REALLY EXCITING.! B'COZ IT HAS MANY FANTASTIC VISUALS(PICS).!!\n\nENJOY.!\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING..\n\n&quot;LIVE AND LET LIVE&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4d1dd1b550ded24281149cf7331a43128217e5","amp;dn":"Space+-+A+Visual+Encyclopedia%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4d1dd1b550ded24281149cf7331a43128217e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,77,29,209,181,80,222,210,66,129,20,156,247,51,26,67,18,130,23,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
