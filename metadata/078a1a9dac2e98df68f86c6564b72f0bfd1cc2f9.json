The Germans enjoy a relationship with walking that has lasted over 200 years. By walking in four very different parts of Germany (the Rhine, the Bavarian Alps, the island of Ruegen and Saxony) Julia explores river valleys, coastlines, mountains and gorges, following in the footsteps of Richard Wagner, Caspar David Friedrich, Johannes Brahms as well as British romantics like William Turner and Lord Byron. This is Julia s chance to discover her own sense of German Wanderlust.\n\nE01 The Rhine 29.11\nE02 The Bavarian Alps 29.00\nE03 The Island of Rugen 28.48\nE04 Saxon Switzerland 29.12\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nSubs: English (soft)\n\nVideo; x264; 720*576 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:078a1a9dac2e98df68f86c6564b72f0bfd1cc2f9","amp;dn":"German+Wanderlust+with+Julia+Bradbury+DVDRip+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"078a1a9dac2e98df68f86c6564b72f0bfd1cc2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,138,26,157,172,46,152,223,104,248,108,101,100,183,47,11,253,28,194,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
