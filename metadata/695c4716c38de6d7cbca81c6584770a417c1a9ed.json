Sunless Sea is a 2D game of discovery, survival and loneliness set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London. Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot?\nEvents can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\nKey features:\n- A deep, compelling world packed with secrets and stories\n- Beautiful, hand drawn 2D art\n- Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Real-time, pausable combat with dozens of different abilities\n- Leave a legacy! When you die (and you will) your next captain may choose to inherit a skill, a chart of discovered islands or a beloved officer.\n- Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n- Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n- Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n- Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine and hallucinogenic honey...\n- Cross the wide black sea\n- Find your way home&quot;\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:695c4716c38de6d7cbca81c6584770a417c1a9ed","amp;dn":"Sunless+Sea+v0.6.2.1649","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"695c4716c38de6d7cbca81c6584770a417c1a9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,92,71,22,195,141,230,215,203,202,129,198,88,71,112,164,23,193,169,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
