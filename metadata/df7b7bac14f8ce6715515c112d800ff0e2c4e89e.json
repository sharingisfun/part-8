We second-guess ourselves, pass judgment on the world around us, and are at our most emotionally vulnerable. And the same needs to be true for our characters. \r\n\r\nInternal dialogue is one of the most powerful tools in a fiction writerâ€™s arsenal. Itâ€™s an advantage we have over TV and movie script writers and playwrights. Itâ€™s also one of the least understood and most often mismanaged elements of the writing craft. \r\n\r\nIn Internal Dialogue: A Busy Writerâ€™s Guide, youâ€™ll learnâ€¦ \r\n- the difference between internal dialogue and narration, \r\n- best practices for formatting internal dialogue, \r\n- ways to use internal dialogue to advance your story, \r\n- how to balance internal dialogue with external action, \r\n- clues to help you decide whether youâ€™re overusing or underusing internal dialogue, \r\n- tips for dealing with questions in your internal dialogue, \r\n- and much more! \r\n\r\nEach book in the Busy Writerâ€™s Guide series is intended to give you enough theory so that you can understand why things work and why they donâ€™t, but also enough examples to see how that theory looks in practice. In addition, they provide tips and exercises to help you take it to the pages of your own story, with an editorâ€™s-eye view. Most importantly, they cut the fluff so that you have more time to write and to live your life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df7b7bac14f8ce6715515c112d800ff0e2c4e89e","amp;dn":"Internal+Dialogue+%28Busy+Writer%27s+Guides+Book+7%29+-+Marcy+Kennedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df7b7bac14f8ce6715515c112d800ff0e2c4e89e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,123,123,172,20,248,206,103,21,81,92,17,45,128,15,240,226,196,232,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
