Sequential chapters describe the structure and function of the heart, the various disease states, and the treatments for each major disease. In addition, the book examines the vast array of diagnostic tests and the most advanced treatments available, from basic drugs for prevention such as aspirin to transplants and artificial hearts.\n\nDr. de Silva, who teaches at Harvard Medical School, also covers historical aspects of heart disease, discoveries about the structure and function of the heart, and the ways in which heart disease can be diagnosed and treated. Underlying conditions that affect the heart are described and linked to the treatments and devices used to correct disease conditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df220523cdb791e83f4d6e86ab3e92785f3ff714","amp;dn":"Heart+Disease+%28Biographies+of+Disease%29-+de+Silva+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df220523cdb791e83f4d6e86ab3e92785f3ff714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,34,5,35,205,183,145,232,63,77,110,134,171,62,146,120,95,63,247,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
