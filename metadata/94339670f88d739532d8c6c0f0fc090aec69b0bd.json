Known as &quot;Mr. Excitement&quot;, Wilson was important in the transition of rhythm and blues into soul. He was known as a master showman, and as one of the most dynamic singers and performers in R&amp;B and rock history. Gaining fame in his early years as a member of the R&amp;B vocal group Billy Ward and His Dominoes, he went solo in 1957 and recorded over 50 hit singles that spanned R&amp;B, pop, soul, doo-wop and easy listening. During a 1975 benefit concert, he collapsed on-stage from a heart attack and subsequently fell into a coma that persisted for nearly nine years until his death in 1984. By this time, he had become one of the most influential artists of his generation.\nA two-time Grammy Hall of Fame Inductee,Jackie Wilson was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Jackie Wilson #68 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Wilson#Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Wilson#Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nJackie Wilson - The Best Of Jackie Wilson\nThis compilation 2002\n\n01  Jackie Wilson - Reet Petite (The Finest Girl You Ever Want To Meet)\n02  Jackie Wilson - I Get The Sweetest Feeling\n03  Jackie Wilson - Whispers (Gettin' Louder)\n04  Jackie Wilson - Lonely Teardrops\n05  Jackie Wilson - No Pity (In The Naked City)\n06  Jackie Wilson - To Be Loved\n07  Jackie Wilson - The Greatest Hurt\n08  Jackie Wilson - (I Can Feel Those Vibrations) This Love Is Real\n09  Jackie Wilson - I Don't Want To Lose You Now\n10  Jackie Wilson - Nothing But Blue Skies\n11  Jackie Wilson - The Who Who Song\n12  Jackie Wilson - Since You Showed Me How To Be Happy\n13  Jackie Wilson - Soul Galore\n14  Jackie Wilson - St James Infirmary\n15  Jackie Wilson - Please Tell Me Why\n16  Jackie Wilson - Doggin Around\n17  Jackie Wilson - A Woman A Lover A Friend\n18  Jackie Wilson - My Yiddisher Momma\n19  Jackie Wilson - You Dont Know What It Means\n20  Jackie Wilson - Hard To Get A Thing Called Love\n21  Jackie Wilson - I've Lost You\n22  Jackie Wilson - I'll Be Satisfied\n24  Jackie Wilson - Baby Workout\n23  Jackie Wilson - Shake Shake Shake &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-jackie-wilson-metro-r926526&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-jackie-wilson-metro-r926526&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94339670f88d739532d8c6c0f0fc090aec69b0bd","amp;dn":"Jackie+Wilson+-+The+Best+Of+Jackie+Wilson+%282002%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94339670f88d739532d8c6c0f0fc090aec69b0bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,51,150,112,248,141,115,149,50,216,198,192,240,252,9,10,236,105,176,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
