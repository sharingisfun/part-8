McDonough\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nA remarkable memoir of small-unit leadership and the coming of age of a young soldier in combat in Vietnam.'\n\n&quot;Using a lean style and a sense of pacing drawn from the tautest of novels, McDonough has produced a gripping account of his first command, a U.S. platoon taking part in the 'strategic hamlet' program. . . . Rather than present a potpourri of combat yarns. . . McDonough has focused a seasoned storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye on the details, people, and incidents that best communicate a visceral feel of command under fire. . . . For the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s honesty and literary craftsmanship, Platoon Leader seems destined to be read for a long time by second lieutenants trying to prepare for the future, veterans trying to remember the past, and civilians trying to understand what the profession of arms is all about.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€œArmy Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c02b75ef79f328fbadfe285437e6242d5014ed","amp;dn":"Platoon+Leader%3A+A+Memoir+of+Command+in+Combat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0c02b75ef79f328fbadfe285437e6242d5014ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,192,43,117,239,121,243,40,251,173,254,40,84,55,230,36,45,80,20,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
