Its target readership includes teachers of ESOL, pre-service translators and interpreters, undergraduates in English linguistics programs, studious advanced learners and users of English, and anyone who is inquisitive about the English language. \n\nThe overall aim is to explain how and why meaning changes when one preposition is swapped for another in the same context. While retaining most of the structure of the original, this edition says more about more prepositions. It includes many more figures ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ virtually all new. The exposition draws on recent research, and is substantially founded on evidence from digitalized corpora, including frequency data. EPE gives information and insights that will not be found in dictionaries and grammar handbooks.............\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70cc250330cd211fcdb2f252fb76a077849f3fb8","amp;dn":"English+Prepositions+Explained-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70cc250330cd211fcdb2f252fb76a077849f3fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,204,37,3,48,205,33,31,205,178,242,82,251,118,160,119,132,159,63,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
