In these conversations, they reveal the secrets behind their successes and failures, offer uplifting stories about how faith in their talent has empowered their careers, and share colorful, entertaining anecdotes about popular movie stars and films.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\n*Starred Review* Much like The Mailroom (2003), which looked at the wheeling and dealing in Hollywood from the perspectives of power players who came up through agency mailrooms, Tales from the Script offers a comprehensive look at the realities of working as a screenwriter from the perspective of those who have made careers out of writing for the big screen. Editors Hanson and Herman interviewed 50 writers for the book, including William Goldman, Antwone Fisher, and Nora Ephron. The writers offer candid thoughts and anecdotes about everything from breaking into the business to learning how to accept rejection, from finding a niche in the business to dealing with getting fired off a project. In between the writersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ commentary are sections that feature thoughts from others involved in the business, including a contest judge, a development executive, and a therapist. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There is a sense of being in the Old West hereÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like panning for gold,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ writer Steve Koren opines. In all, this overview captures the excitement, frustration, and reality of being a working screenwriter in an accessible and essential volume that aspiring screenwriters will devour. --Kristine Huntley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e47cba3b7b05c70a13a2b056d0942af4e21ec9","amp;dn":"Tales+from+the+Script%3A+50+Hollywood+Screenwriters+Share+Their+St","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e47cba3b7b05c70a13a2b056d0942af4e21ec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,228,124,186,59,123,5,199,10,19,162,176,86,208,148,42,244,226,30,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
