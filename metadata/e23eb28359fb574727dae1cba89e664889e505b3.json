He has become far more than just a boy who won a game: he is the Savior of Earth, a hero, a military genius whose allegiance is sought by every nation of the newly shattered Earth Hegemony.\n\nHe is offered the choice of living in isolation on Eros, at one of the Hegemony&amp;#039;s training facilities, but instead the 12-year-old chooses to leave his home world and begin the long relativistic journey out to the colonies. With him went his sister Valentine, and the core of the artificial intelligence that would become Jane.\n\nThe story of those years has never been told...until now.\n\n****************************************************\nhaven&amp;#039;t listen to it yet.(other than checking at every ten min mark to see if it was in good working order.)\nthere in 2 MP3 files(don&amp;#039;t ask why only 2 file&amp;#039;s, i prefer 1 per chapter)\nit&amp;#039;s length is 13:45ish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e23eb28359fb574727dae1cba89e664889e505b3","amp;dn":"Ender+in+Exile+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e23eb28359fb574727dae1cba89e664889e505b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,62,178,131,89,251,87,71,39,218,225,203,168,158,102,72,137,229,5,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
