Generally, these modelsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ predictions were used without acknowledging that reality may or may not reflect the assumptions made and thus the predictions. The book aims to provide solutions on how to include model risk into existing risk measurement frameworks. It also aims to provide solutions on how to build models of higher accuracy and thus lower model risk.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\n\nDaniel RÃƒÂ¶sch and Harald Scheule\n\nSection 1: Concepts and Stochastic Frameworks for Model Risk\n\n1 Downturn Model Risk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Another View on the Global Financial Crisis\n\nDaniel RÃƒÂ¶sch and Harald Scheule\n\n2 Follow the Money from Boom to Bust\n\nJorge Sobehart\n\n3 Model Risk and Non-Gaussian Latent Risk Factors\n\nSteffi HÃƒÂ¶se and Stefan Huschens\n\n4 Model Risk in GARCH-type financial time series\n\nCorinna Luedtke and Philipp Sibbertsen\n\n\nSection 2: Regulatory Requirements for Model Risk\n\n5 Monetary Policy, Asset Return Dynamics and the General Equilibrium Effect\n\nKuang-Liang Chang, Nan-Kuang Chen and Charles Ka Yui Leung\n\n6 Capitals fall apart: Sensitivity of Economic and Regulatory Capital under Stress\n\nOleg Burd\n\nSection 3: Credit Portfolio Risk Models\n\n7 Diversified Asset Portfolio Modeling: Sources and Mitigants of Model Risk\n\nSean Keenan, Andrew Barnes, Stefano Santilli, Sukyul Suh, Colin McColloch and Harry Ma\n\n8 Transmission of macro shocks to loan losses in a deep crisis: The case of Finland\n\nEsa Jokivuolle, Oskari VÃƒÂ¤hÃƒÂ¤maa and Matti VirÃƒÂ©n\n\n\n9 Comparison of credit risk models for portfolios of retail loans based on behavioural scores\n\nLyn C Thomas and Madhur Malik\n\n10 Validating Structural Credit Portfolio Models\n\nMichael Kalkbrener and Akwum Onwunta\n\n11 Asymmetric Asset Correlation: Some Implications on the Estimation of Probability of Default\n\nPeter Miu and Bogie Ozdemir\n\n12 A Latent Variable Approach to Validate Credit Rating Systems\n\nKurt Hornik, Rainer Jankowitsch, Christoph Leitner, Manuel Lingo, Stefan Pichler and Gerhard Winkler\n\n\nSection 4: Liquidity, Market and Operational risk models\n\n13 Modelling Derivatives Cash Flows in Liquidity Risk Models\n\nStefan Reitz\n\n14 Potential Future Market Risk\n\nManuela Spangler and Ralf Werner\n\n15 Model Risk in Market Risk Modelling\n\nCarsten S.
