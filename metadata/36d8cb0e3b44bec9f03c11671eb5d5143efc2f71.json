However well intentioned they may be, leaders who deceive themselves always end up undermining their own performance.This straightforward book explains how leaders can discover their own self-deceptions and learn how to escape destructive patterns. The authors demonstrate that breaking out of these patterns leads to improved teamwork, commitment, trust, communication, motivation, and leadership.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d8cb0e3b44bec9f03c11671eb5d5143efc2f71","amp;dn":"Leadership+and+Self-Deception+-+The+Arbinger+Institute.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d8cb0e3b44bec9f03c11671eb5d5143efc2f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,216,203,14,59,68,190,201,240,60,17,103,30,181,213,20,62,252,47,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
