He received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for a creative poetic writing which illuminates man's condition in the cosmos and in present-day society, at the same time representing the great renewal of the traditions of Spanish poetry between the wars.&quot;\r\n\r\nAleixandre was one of the few writers to remain in Spain during the Spanish Civil War.  His passive but staunch political independence kept his writings banned for a decade, but his vivid poems of harmony and commonality would eventually symbolize much of what post-Civil War Spain aspired toward.\r\n\r\nThe bilingual Spanish-English collection A LONGING FOR THE LIGHT spans the entirety of Aleixandre's career, from the early surrealist work to his complex and fascinating &quot;dialogues.&quot;  It also contains prose interludes, an introduction by editor Lewis Hyde, and a descriptive bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following texts are in PDF format:\r\n\r\n* A Longing for the Light: Selected Poems of Vicente Aleixandre (Copper Canyon, 1985).  Bilingual edition.  Edited by Lewis Hyde.\r\n\r\n* The Nobel Prize Lecture (Nobel Foundation, 1977).\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT ME: You can reach me with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc., at TPB's forum, SuprBay (you will need to register an account):\r\n                          \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee  \r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED!
