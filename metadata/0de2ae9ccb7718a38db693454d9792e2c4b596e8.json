Born from a lab-enhanced clone mother and an Aedh father, she can not only talk to the souls of the dying and the dead, but she can see the reapers and walk the gray fields that divide this world from the next.\n\nThey are skill she rarely uses, however, preferring to concentrate on the business she shares with her two best friends. But when her mother asks her to help the parents of a little girl locked in a coma, she reluctantly agrees. What she discovers scares the hell out of her. Because the little girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul no longer resides in her body, and it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t death and the reapers that took her.\n\nSomeone had ripped her soul from her flesh.\n\nAs it turns out, a creature consuming the souls of the innocentÃ¢â‚¬â€œand not so innocentÃ¢â‚¬â€œis the least of her problems.\n\nBecause someone wants to rip open the gates that divided hell from earth, and Risa is a key component in their plans.\n\nAnd the only person standing between her and disaster is a reaper who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly on her side.\n\n\n                           Book 01 - Darkness Unbound\n\n                           Book 02 - Darkness Rising\n\n                           Book 03 - Darkness Devours\n\n                           Book 04 - Darkness Hunts\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de2ae9ccb7718a38db693454d9792e2c4b596e8","amp;dn":"Dark+Angels+Series+by+Keri+Arthur+%28Books+1+to+4%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0de2ae9ccb7718a38db693454d9792e2c4b596e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,226,174,156,203,119,24,163,141,182,147,69,77,151,146,226,196,181,150,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
