The bulk of the first and second discs were recorded at the World Amphitheater in suburban Chicago during the 1997 Test for Echo tour, along with three songs from the 1994 Counterparts tour. The third disc is taken from a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in London during the A Farewell to Kings tour in 1978.\n\nThis album was compiled and released in the wake of the deaths of Neil Peart's daughter and wife in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Production of the album occurred during Peart's recovery from his loss as chronicled in his book Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road and as a consequence he was not involved in the production of the album; at the time, Peart had declared to his bandmates that they should consider him retired, and so Lifeson and Lee were facing the possibility that it might be the band's last ever release. The album is dedicated to the memory of Neil Peart's daughter Selena, who died in a car accident in 1997, and his wife Jacqueline, who died of cancer 10 months later. The text, &quot;Suddenly... You were gone... from all the lives you left your mark upon. In loving memory of Jackie and Selena,&quot; is printed inside the foldout cardboard sleeve. The lyrics featured are from the song &quot;Afterimage,&quot; from their 1984 album Grace Under Pressure.\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n    &quot;Dreamline&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:34\n    &quot;Limelight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n    &quot;Driven&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:16\n    &quot;Bravado&quot; (recorded on April 30, 1994 at the Spectrum in Philadelphia) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:23\n    &quot;Animate&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:29\n    &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; (recorded on February 27, 1994 at the Miami Arena) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29\n    &quot;The Trees&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:28\n    &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:01\n    &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; (Lifeson, Lee, Peart, Peter Talbot) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n    &quot;2112: Overture&quot; - 4:35\n    &quot;2112: The Temples of Syrinx&quot; - 2:22\n    &quot;2112: Discovery&quot; - 4:19\n    &quot;2112: Presentation&quot; - 3:42\n    &quot;2112: Oracle&quot; - 1:51\n    &quot;2112: Soliloquy&quot; - 2:10\n    &quot;2112: Grand Finale&quot; - 2:37\n\nDisc 2\n\n    &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (Lifeson, Lee, Peart, Pye Dubois) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:15\n    &quot;The Analog Kid&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14\n    &quot;Freewill&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:36\n    &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:58\n    &quot;Stick It Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42\n    &quot;Resist&quot;  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:27\n    &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; (Lifeson, Lee) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n    &quot;The Rhythm Method - 1997&quot; (Peart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:19\n    &quot;Natural Science&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:05\n    &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (Lifeson, Lee, Peart, Pye Dubois) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:18\n    &quot;YYZ&quot; (Lee, Peart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:25\n\nDisc 3\n\nRecorded on February 20, 1978 in London at the Hammersmith Odeon.\n\n    &quot;Bastille Day&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;By-Tor &amp; The Snow Dog&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:59\n    &quot;Xanadu&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 12:32\n    &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:53\n    &quot;Something for Nothing&quot; (Lee, Peart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:01\n    &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:23\n    &quot;Anthem&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:47\n    &quot;Working Man&quot; (Lifeson, Lee) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:00\n    &quot;Fly by Night&quot; (Lee, Peart) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:04\n    &quot;In the Mood&quot; (Lee) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n    &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (Lee, Lifeson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb6504bb6ebbb61a444096c0dea3f6995cb3370","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Different+Stages+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb6504bb6ebbb61a444096c0dea3f6995cb3370","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,182,80,75,182,235,187,97,164,68,9,108,13,234,63,105,149,203,51,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
