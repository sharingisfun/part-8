The film chronicles the compelling and inspirational story of four teenage boys, the sons of Mexican immigrants, who entered a sophisticated underwater robotics competition, going up against the likes of engineering powerhouse MIT.\n\nThis inspiring feat first started when two energetic high school science teachers, on a whim, decided to enter their high school, a Title I school where most of the students live in poverty, into a sophisticated underwater robotics competition sponsored by the NASA and the Office of Naval Research, among others. Only four boys signed up for the competition, but once assembled, with enthusiasm and verve, they started calling oceanic engineers and military contractors for design help. They were advised that their underwater robot would require glass syntactic flotation foam. Short on money, all they could afford was PVC pipe from Home Depot. And some duct tape.\n\nWhat occurred, when they arrived at the competition to face college teams in matching gear, with robots sponsored by the likes of Exxon Mobil, shaped a legacy that could not have been imagined. A legacy of aspiration. Of activism. Of dreamers.\n\n\n----------------------\n\ntitle........: underwater dreams\ngenre(s).....: documentaries\nruntime......: 43:32\nsize.........: 272MB\nresolution...: 720x404\nvideo........: x264\naudio........: AAC 2ch\nair date.....: 2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574916f96c4a8d062811ffd5ddbc0ee36a4ed8f0","amp;dn":"Underwater.Dreams.HDTV.x264-DaViEW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574916f96c4a8d062811ffd5ddbc0ee36a4ed8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,73,22,249,108,74,141,6,40,17,255,213,221,188,14,227,106,78,216,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
