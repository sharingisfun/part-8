He enjoyed entertaining his colleagues by singing opera arias while he polished the cars, and one day was overheard by a client with connections in the music industry who was so impressed, he suggested Boe should go to London and audition for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. His audition was a success and he gave up polishing cars to embark on a singing career. Boe has never been able to trace the customer who suggested he go for the audition, having lost the man's business card.\n\n1. &quot;Bring Him Home&quot;     \n2. &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;     \n3. &quot;Come What May&quot; (with Kerry Ellis)   \n4. &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot;     \n5. &quot;As If We Never Said Goodbye&quot;     \n6. &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot;     \n7. &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;     \n8. &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; (with Matt Lucas)   \n9. &quot;If I Loved You&quot;     \n10. &quot;Tell Me It's Not True&quot;     \n11. &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot;     \n12. &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot;   \n\n160kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205364d5f71024a581443403e69e24e624554d2c","amp;dn":"Alfie+Boe+-+Bring+Him+Home+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205364d5f71024a581443403e69e24e624554d2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,83,100,213,247,16,36,165,129,68,52,3,230,158,36,230,36,85,77,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
