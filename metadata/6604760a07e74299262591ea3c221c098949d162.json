The object of the book is to provide the reader with a with a description of the origins of coal together with the physical and chemical properties of coal and coal petrology before proceeding to cover all areas of coal exploration, production and use.\n\n- Bridges the gap between academic aspects of coal geology and the practical role of geology in the coal industry\n- Examines historical and stratigraphical geology, together with mining, environmental issues, geophysics and hydrogeology and the marketing of coal\n- Defines worldwide coal resource classifications and methods of calculation\n- Addresses the alternative uses of coal as a source of energy, together with the environmental implications of coal usage\n- Includes improved illustrations including a colour section\n- Offers a global approach covering expanding fields in America, China and India\n\nThe truly global approach, drawn from the international experiences of the author, recognizes the growing role of coal use in emerging markets. With fully revised coverage of the latest modelling techniques, environmental legislation, equipment and recording methods, the second edition offers a truly invaluable resource for anyone studying, researching or working in the field of coal geology, geotechnical and mining engineering and environmental science.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface To First Edition, ix\nPreface, xi\n1 Preview, 1\n2 Origin of Coal, 3\n3 Age and Occurrence of Coal, 53\n4 Coal as a Substance, 87\n5 Coal Sampling and Analysis, 137\n6 Coal Exploration and Data Collection, 151\n7 Coal Resources and Reserves, 185\n8 Geophysics of Coal, 211\n9 Hydrogeology of Coal, 253\n10 Geology and Coal Mining, 271\n11 Coal as an Alternative Energy Source, 303\n12 Coal Use and the Environment, 339\n13 Coal Marketing, 369\nReferences, 385\nAppendix 1 List of International and National Standards used in Coal and Coke Analysis and Evaluation, 399\nAppendix 2 Tables of True and Apparent Dip, Slope Angles, Gradients and Per Cent Slope, 415\nAppendix 3 Calorific Values Expressed in Different Units, 417\nAppendix 4 Units of measurement, 421\nAppendix 5 Methane Units Converter, 423\nGlossary,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6604760a07e74299262591ea3c221c098949d162","amp;dn":"Coal+Geology+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6604760a07e74299262591ea3c221c098949d162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,4,118,10,7,231,66,153,38,37,145,234,60,34,28,9,137,73,209,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
