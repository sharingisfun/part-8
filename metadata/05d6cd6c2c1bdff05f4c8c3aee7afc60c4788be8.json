It gives readers a thorough understanding of the key concepts in strategic thought, concepts that have endured since the Athenian general Thucydides and the Chinese philosopher/warrior Sun Tzu first wrote about strategy some 2500 years ago. It also examines the influence on strategic choice and military strategy of political, legal and technological change. This book discusses strategy at every level of competition, employing a thematic approach and using historical examples from 500 BCE to the present. It discusses the contraints and opportunities facing military commanders in the 21st century, and demonstrates that the formulation of military strategy will continue to be perhaps the single most important responsibility for senior security officials. Making Sense of War offers original insights into the imperatives of military success in the era of asymmetric warfare.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Making-Sense-War-Strategy-Century/dp/0521676649&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Making-Sense-War-Strategy-Century/dp/0521676649&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05d6cd6c2c1bdff05f4c8c3aee7afc60c4788be8","amp;dn":"Making+Sense+of+War%3A+Strategy+for+the+21st+Century","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05d6cd6c2c1bdff05f4c8c3aee7afc60c4788be8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,214,205,108,44,27,223,240,95,76,140,58,238,122,252,96,196,120,139,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
