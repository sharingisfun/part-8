At its controls was a 21-year-old pilot. Half his crew lay wounded or dead. It was their first mission. Suddenly, a sleek, dark shape pulled up on the bomberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tailÃ¢â‚¬â€a German Messerschmitt fighter. Worse, the German pilot was an ace, a man able to destroy the American bomber in the squeeze of a trigger. What happened next would defy imagination and later be called the most incredible encounter between enemies in World War II.\n\nThis is the true story of the two pilots whose lives collided in the skies that dayÃ¢â‚¬â€the AmericanÃ¢â‚¬â€2nd Lieutenant Charlie Brown, a former farm boy from West Virginia who came to captain a B-17Ã¢â‚¬â€and the GermanÃ¢â‚¬â€2nd Lieutenant Franz Stigler, a former airline pilot from Bavaria who sought to avoid fighting in World War II.\n\nA Higher Call follows both Charlie and FranzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harrowing missions. Charlie would face takeoffs in English fog over the flaming wreckage of his buddiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ planes, flak bursts so close they would light his cockpit, and packs of enemy fighters that would circle his plane like sharks. Franz would face sandstorms in the desert, a crash alone at sea, and the spectacle of 1,000 bombers each with eleven guns, waiting for his attack.\n\nUltimately, Charlie and Franz would stare across the frozen skies at one another. What happened between them, the American 8th Air Force would later classify as Ã¢â‚¬Å“top secret.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It was an act that Franz could never mention or else face a firing squad. It was the encounter that would haunt both Charlie and Franz for forty years until, as old men, they would search for one another, a last mission that could change their lives forever.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nMilitary historian and aviation enthusiast Makos, along with WWII biographer Alexander (In the Footsteps of the Band of Brothers), delivers a top-notch narrative of the unlikely encounter between one of GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading fighter aces, Franz Stigler, and the rookie crew of an American bomber in the frigid skies of Germany in December 1943Ã¢â‚¬â€upon engaging the already damaged American plane, Stigler had mercy on his enemies and escorted them to safety. Building on the events of that encounter, Makos crafts a multifaceted story, relating the career of Stigler from his first taste of combat in North Africa to his final assignment flying jet fighters in the waning battles of the war in Europe. He also follows American Lt. Charlie Brown and his crew through training and to the successful completion of their combat tour in April 1944. Based on thousands of hours of interviews and an evident knowledge of his subject, Makos details the frantic life of the German fighter pilots living on the edge, and the American bomber crews, far from home, fighting to survive. The book is a riveting story of humanity and mercy set against the ghastly backdrop of war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125262ae026fc65e45969f1e4736ebe5bd48f43f","amp;dn":"Adam+Makos+-+A+Higher+Call+%5B96%5D+Unabridged+%28WWII+History%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125262ae026fc65e45969f1e4736ebe5bd48f43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,82,98,174,2,111,198,94,69,150,159,30,71,54,235,229,189,72,244,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
