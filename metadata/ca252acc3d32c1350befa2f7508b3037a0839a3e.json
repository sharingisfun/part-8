Neko's principal charm may be her voice--sometimes \n\ncoming on with Dusty Springfield's indigo-eyed soul (the dreamlike \n\n&quot;Porchlight&quot;), Patsy Cline's aching slow burn (the slinky &quot;No Need to Cry&quot;), \n\nand Wanda Jackson's imperious sexuality (the rockabilly &quot;Mood to Burn \n\nBridges&quot;)--but her songwriting (she cowrote every tune) is surprisingly \n\nconsistent and memorable. She celebrates the &quot;passion for life&quot; found in her \n\nabandoned home of Tacoma, Washington, or a strapped-on Telecaster, and \n\non her best song, &quot;Guided by Wire,&quot; she balances between &quot;darkest \n\nrecollection&quot; and the freedom of music, the kind that matters most, all those \n\nvoices &quot;singing my life back to me.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/20/neko-case/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/20/neko-case/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca252acc3d32c1350befa2f7508b3037a0839a3e","amp;dn":"Neko+Case+and+her+Boyfriends...Furnace+Room+Lullaby%282000%29reissue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca252acc3d32c1350befa2f7508b3037a0839a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,37,42,204,61,50,193,53,11,239,162,247,80,139,48,55,160,131,154,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
