Platform games are a great way to get your feet wet in the world of game development.\n\nI create the game used in the course from scratch once, and then recreate again while recording and explaining exactly what I am doing.\n\nYou will learn by watching the videos and following along at your own pace, pausing when needed.  I try to pause at key spots to give you a chance to get a good look and understanding of what I am teaching.  \n\nIf you are a beginner to Construct 2 or game design in general, this is a great class for you.\n\nSource Code, Graphics, and Sound files are all included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8d166b9f75ab3b50ee82b3aa86c4adc3413fba9","amp;dn":"Platform+Game+Creation+With+Construct+2+%28HTML5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8d166b9f75ab3b50ee82b3aa86c4adc3413fba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,209,102,185,247,90,179,181,14,232,43,58,168,108,74,220,52,19,251,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
