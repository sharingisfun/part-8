GAME.TYPE ........: CRPG\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years after the fateful events in Part 1 of the &quot;Two Worlds&quot; saga, the\n\npower of Gandohar, the Dark Imperator, is at its peak. The joy and relief\n\nexperienced by the populace of Antaloor when he conquered the proud Orcs was\n\nsoon brutally stifled by his reign of unbelievable terror. The depths of his\n\nevil character were revealed much too fast... and much too cruelly. Only one\n\nwarrior with the combined power of two worlds can destroy this spell of evil\n\n- and the people yearn for his coming. But... the hero is a prisoner in the\n\ncity's deepest dungeon, so he'll have to start out on the path to his\n\nadventures from this dark and gloomy location. He'll enjoy victories and\n\ntaste bitter defeats, he'll be betrayed and befriended and he'll be met by\n\nmind-boggling mysteries and sudden surprises on his travels. However, new\n\npowers are entering the scene - and they will plunge the player deep into\n\nAntaloor's past. One quest will take the hero back to his roots, present him\n\nwith surprising twists and turns in the game - and transport him into a truly\n\nnew dimension in the RPG genre. Gameplay&quot;Two Worlds II&quot; offers a perfect\n\nsymbiosis of the most important RP features - sheer atmosphere and dazzling\n\ntechnology.
