There are however some really exciting things on the horizon for texture painting as well as lighting and rendering of these assets. \n\nThis training will begin to introduce you to some of these techniques including using a physically based workflow which will give us highly realistic looking results. To get things started weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create our MARI project and bring in our geometry as well as both normal and ambient occlusion maps that have been baked out from the high resolution model. From here weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use HDR images as image based lighting for our textures right inside of MARI. Throughout this training, we'll focus on painting a color or Albedo map, a reflectance map and a gloss map for the asset. \n\nTo wrap things up, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to get our maps out of MARI so they can be used in our game engines. After completing this tutorial, you will have a good grasp over the process of texturing a game asset using a physically based workflow in MARI. \n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and project overview\n\n2.Setting up the project\n\n3.Creating selection groups\n\n4.Painting color for the wood handle\n\n5.Painting color for the metal\n\n6.Painting color for metal accents\n\n7.Painting heavy wear and stains\n\n8.Painting scratches\n\n9.Texture creation for physically based rendering\n\n10.Painting a reflectance map\n\n11.Painting a gloss map\n\n12.Tweaking color textures\n\n13.Exporting final texture maps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3738303267e6d81774146b945a4bb92603e93906","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Painting+Textures+for+Low+Polygon+Props+in+MARI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3738303267e6d81774146b945a4bb92603e93906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,56,48,50,103,230,216,23,116,20,107,148,90,75,185,38,3,233,57,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
