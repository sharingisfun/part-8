John Hersey transports us back to the streets of Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the day the city was destroyed by the first atomic bomb. Told through the memories of six survivors, Hiroshima is a timeless, powerful classic that will awaken your heart and your compassion. In this new edition, Hersey returns to Hiroshima to find the survivorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and to tell their fates in an eloquent and moving final chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ab311ceeb422cf2af9c685360cedf4098bf283","amp;dn":"HIROSHIMA+-+John+Hersey.+Read+by+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ab311ceeb422cf2af9c685360cedf4098bf283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,171,49,28,238,180,34,207,42,249,198,133,54,12,237,244,9,139,242,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
