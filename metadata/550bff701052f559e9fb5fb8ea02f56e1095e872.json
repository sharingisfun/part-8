I present a new and very easy method for cooking ephedrine from health food store and hardware store materials. This eliminates the need to purchase the heavily regulated and polluted pills. I also present a series of new recipes which eliminate the need for obtaining iodine, red Phosphorus or anhydrous ammonia. The older recipes have been improved to make use of the weak or adultered materials now commonly found on store shelves. Everyone interested in the rapidly changing field of clandestine chemistry should have a copy of this book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550bff701052f559e9fb5fb8ea02f56e1095e872","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Methamphetamine+Manufacture%2C+8th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550bff701052f559e9fb5fb8ea02f56e1095e872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,11,255,112,16,82,245,89,233,251,95,184,234,2,245,110,16,149,232,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
