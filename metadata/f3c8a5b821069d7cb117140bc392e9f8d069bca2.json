We had a couple hiccups with the standalone build getting rolled out before it was quite ready, but the issues that caused should be solved now. I'm about to set the build live on Steam, so I'm putting up the patch notes now.\n \nPatch Notes for Rev 102535\n \n \nBug Fixes\n \nCrashes\nFixed crash that could occur when Catcoon vomited (believe cause was if it switched from neutral to friendly while it was retching a high number of times).\nFixed crash that would occur a few seconds after a Slurtle had been lit on fire.\nFixed crash that could occur when Birchnut Tree switched its leaf state (to a different season or to its monster version) - OverrideSymbol crash.\nFixed crash that would occur when a Lureplant ate something that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stackable (i.e. tallbird egg).\nFixed crash that could occur when something died when playing as Wendy.\n \nWorld and Systems\nShadows from falling items (specifically moles and rabbits, I believe) will no longer stick around permanently after an earthquake.\nSummer DSP (i.e. muffled sounds) will no longer get into a bad state when transitioning from Spring to Summer.\nRain will now continue properly when loading a game that was saved with rain falling at the time of the save.\nLightning strikes at the start of Night will no longer cause the lighting to go to full darkness after the lightning.\nPlayer will now enter Ruins at the location of the rope after dying in the Ruins, rather than at their death location.\nItems that transform during a Full Moon will no longer get stuck in a bad state due to entering/exiting caves surrounding a Full Moon.\nThe Game is Afoot adventure level should now use the correct season mode in Reign of Giants (seasons as described on the wiki).\nWetness threshold on the world now matches the wetness threshold on the inventory.\n \nCreatures\nFireflies now turn light on and off and disperse appropriately.\nMoleworms will make new Burrows after being dropped (provided their home Burrow has been dug up) again.\nSnurtle and Slurtle will drop shell pieces again.\nGlommer will stay bound to the Glommer Flower when entering/exiting caves instead of starting to follow the player.\nFrogs will now only steal leafy meat from a Lureplant if the Lureplant is showing the meat.\nBees and Butterflies can no longer be combined into a stack from the inventory with a wild bee/butterfly.\nCreatures following the player will no longer respawn and immediately die when entering/exiting the caves.\nVolt Goats will now attack walls.\nWalrus Camps will no longer spawn additional creatures on load.\nCreatures no longer get stuck in a behavior (i.e. OnFire or GoHome: manifested as creatures walking into walls forever, etc).\nHound wave warning sfx no longer get stuck playing if save/load while they are playing.\nIce Hounds will now spawn in hound waves during Spring.\n \nItems\nEndothermic fire sfx will now fall off properly.\nOval screen overlay is now less visible when wearing the Moggles.\nFoods cooked in a Crock Pot no longer inherit the moisture from their ingredients: the product will always be dry when it finishes cooking.\nWaterproof items can no longer get wet.\nWigfridÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spear and Helm are now set to be specific to her.\nWillowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lighter no longer cools the player during Summer.\nAn Egg that rots in an Ice Box will no longer disappear (Rotten Eggs can now go in the Ice Box).\nItems (inventory items and planted items) will no longer disappear on load if they have been lit on fire and extinguished.\n \nCharacters\nChanging the Wigfrid Umlaut option while in a game will now make the change take effect immediately, instead of only after loading the game.\nWickerbottom will now get correct penalties for eating stale or spoiled food.\nWebber will no longer target spiders when pressing F to attack.\n \nMisc\nButton hint for controllers was not showing when focus was on the Reign of Giants toggle button on the new game screen.\nFix Ã¢â‚¬Å“ACTIONÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ button hint text on some inventory items when using a controller.\n \nChanges\nHambat can now be placed in the Ice Box.\nBrightened dusk in Spring slightly.\nSleeping in a Siesta Canopy or Tent now dries you by 30 moisture points instead of reducing moisture to 0.\nMoles and Rabbits will no longer get dropped by earthquakes in the Ruins.\nImprove the way that the Spring giantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warning sfx are played.\nMake number of frogs spawned from Frog Rain increase over time (starts lower than previous default).\nImprove the way rain damage is calculated for WX-78.\nRe-export strings.pot files to include some new strings.\n \nAdditions\nCan now click a button to select a random character on the character select screen.\nAdded a maximum number of flowers spawned in an area from rain during Spring.

The variables are Ã¢â‚¬Å“dont_starve_compatibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“reign_of_giants_compatibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (no quotes) respectively.\nAdded support for mod configuration options.
