As such, this is not the ideal Toto best-of and earns its &quot;pick&quot; designation over Toto IV only by virtue of its inclusion of the group's first hit, &quot;Hold the Line.&quot;\nAll Music Review by William Ruhlmann\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Love Has The Power\n[02] Africa\n[03] Hold The Line\n[04] Out Of Love\n[05] Georgy Porgy\n[06] I'll Be Over You\n[07] Can You Hear What I'm Saying\n[08] Rosanna\n[09] I Won't Hold You Back\n[10] Stop Loving You\n[11] 99\n[12] Pamela\n[13] Animal\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:04m:57s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 155mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
