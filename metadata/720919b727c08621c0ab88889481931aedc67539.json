We know their mistakes, their struggles, and their joys. But have you ever wondered how celebrities and other public figures would reflect on their lives since they passed? \n\nChanneled by a psychic medium and written in interview format, Conversations with History takes us on a unique journey with 22 spirits who were famous (or infamous) during their time on Earth, ranging from 600 B.C. to A.D. 2011. Renowned personalitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€from Charlemagne, Ben Franklin, and Eva PerÃƒÂ³n to Gandhi, Walt Disney, and Steve JobsÃ¢â‚¬â€have returned with the clarity that can be gained only from the Other Side. These spirits are taking center stage one more time to offer new insights into their lives and share important messages with us about abundance and prosperity, love and relationships, creativity and art, personal responsibility for the world around us, and the legacy we leave for future generations. In every interview, there are simple but powerful lessons that we can use to improve our lives every day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720919b727c08621c0ab88889481931aedc67539","amp;dn":"Conversations+with+History+%28Psychic+Medium%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720919b727c08621c0ab88889481931aedc67539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,9,25,183,39,192,134,33,192,171,136,136,148,129,147,26,237,198,117,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
