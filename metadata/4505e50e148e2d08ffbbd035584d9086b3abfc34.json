He is an Australian musician, songwriter, author, screenwriter, painter, and occasional actor. He is best known for his work in the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, established in 1984, who have become critically acclaimed for their fascination with American roots music. Before that, he had fronted the group The Birthday Party in the early 1980s, a band renowned for its highly dark, challenging lyrics and violent sound influenced by free jazz, blues, and post-punk. In 2006, he formed the garage rock band Grinderman that released its debut the following year. Cave's music is generally characterised by intensity and a wide variety of influences. Nick Cave currently lives in Brighton &amp; Hove, England.\n\nUpon Cave's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, ARIA Awards committee chairman Ed St John said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNick Cave has enjoyed - and continues to enjoy - one of the most extraordinary careers in the annals of popular music. He is an Australian artist like Sidney Nolan is an Australian artist - beyond comparison, beyond genre, beyond dispute.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
