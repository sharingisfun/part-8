In spoken English, if a contraction exists for a pair of words, the full forms will be used relatively infrequently (mostly for emphasis). For example, the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œit isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are often written and pronounced ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll notice that English spelling is irregular, with the same sounds being written in different ways.\nSometimes words may be spelled the same but have different meanings and pronunciations.
