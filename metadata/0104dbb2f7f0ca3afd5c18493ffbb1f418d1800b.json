It was the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States, with sales of 7.6 million copies.[3] At the 2003 Grammy Awards it was nominated for Album of the Year and became Eminem's third LP in four years to win the award for Best Rap Album.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling approximately 284,000 units in its first week, which due to a premature release by retailers and street-date violations, counted only a day and a half of sales.[4] The album sold 1,322,000 copies the following week, where it registered a full week of sales.[5][6] The album topped the Billboard 200 for five consecutive weeks.[7][8] The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart.[9] It has gone on to sell over ten million copies.[10] On March 7, 2011, the album was certified ten-times-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America,[11] making it Eminem's second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States.\n\nIn 2009, the album was ranked #317 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and was later ranked at #84 on the same magazine's best albums of the 2000s decade. The album received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem's most personal and best work. Eminem himself acknowledged during an interview with MTV that was recorded on May 25, 2002, that he felt that The Eminem Show was his &quot;best record so far&quot;.[12] The Eminem Show was Eminem's first album to be mainly self-produced.\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tProducer(s) \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Curtains Up&quot; (skit)  \t0:30\n2. \t&quot;White America&quot;   \t5:24\n3. \t&quot;Business&quot;    \t        4:11\n4. \t&quot;Cleanin' Out My Closet&quot;\t4:58\n5. \t&quot;Square Dance&quot;    \t5:24\n6. \t&quot;The Kiss&quot; (skit) \t1:16\n7. \t&quot;Soldier&quot;   \t \t3:46\n8. \t&quot;Say Goodbye Hollywood&quot; 4:33\n9. \t&quot;Drips&quot; (featuring Obie Trice) \t4:45\n10. \t&quot;Without Me&quot;   \tMathers \t4:50\n11. \t&quot;Paul Rosenberg&quot; (skit) \t0:23\n12. \t&quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;   \t5:40\n13. \t&quot;Superman&quot; (featuring Dina Rae) 5:50\n14. \t&quot;Hailie's Song&quot;   \t \t5:21\n15. \t&quot;Steve Berman&quot; (skit) \t  \t  \t0:33\n16. \t&quot;When the Music Stops&quot; (featuring D12) \t4:29\n17. \t&quot;Say What You Say&quot; (featuring Dr. Dre) \t5:09\n18. \t&quot;'Till I Collapse&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg)4:57\n19. \t&quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot; (featuring Hailie Jade) \t4:28\n20. \t&quot;Curtains Close&quot; (skit) 1:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0104dbb2f7f0ca3afd5c18493ffbb1f418d1800b","amp;dn":"The+Eminem+Show","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0104dbb2f7f0ca3afd5c18493ffbb1f418d1800b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,4,219,178,247,240,202,58,253,92,24,73,63,251,177,244,24,209,128,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
