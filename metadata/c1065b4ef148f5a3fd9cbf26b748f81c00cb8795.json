Stargaze with a telescope, binoculars, or even your naked eye. Allow Dr. Jason Lisle, a research scientist with a masters and PhD in astrophysics, to guide you in examining the beauty of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Creation.\nLisle designed Stargazer's Guide to the Night Sky for everyone from young students to amateur astronomers. In it you will:\n-Learn the best ways and optimal times to observe planets and stars\n-Discover how to choose the best telescope for you\n-Find 150 stunning, full-color star-charts and other easy to use illustrations for success\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“How do phases of the moon work?

What sorts of objects can be seen with binoculars?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These questions and many more are easily answered with the helpful tips and basic understanding of astronomy presented in this book.\nCreate or expand the hobby of stargazing; an outdoor, educational hobby to enjoy with friends or family. Regardless of your circumstances and the economy, you will always be able to marvel at the beauty of our night sky.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Lisle graduated summa cum laude from Ohio Wesleyan University where he double-majored in physics and astronomy, and minored in mathematics. He did graduate work at the University of Colorado where he earned a MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics. While there, Dr Lisle used the SOHO spacecraft to investigate motions on the surface of the sun as well as solar magnetism and subsurface weather. His thesis was entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Probing the Dynamics of Solar Supergranulation and its Interaction with Magnetism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Among other things, he discovered a previously unknown polar alignment of supergranules (solar convection cells), and discovered evidence of solar giant cells. He has also authored a number of papers in both secular and creation literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1065b4ef148f5a3fd9cbf26b748f81c00cb8795","amp;dn":"The+Stargaze%27s+Guide+To+The+Night+Sky+-+Dr.+Jason+Lisle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1065b4ef148f5a3fd9cbf26b748f81c00cb8795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,6,91,78,241,72,245,163,253,156,191,38,183,72,248,28,0,203,135,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
