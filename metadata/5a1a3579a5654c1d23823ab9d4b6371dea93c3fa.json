How Sex Works challenges common perceptions about our bodies and provides astonishing discoveries from the frontiers of science as it traces the transformation of sex across species and through time to its current role in human societies.\n\nFind out the answers to such provocative questions as:\n\n* Can the birth control pill influence the type of men women are attracted to?\n* What do men and honeybees have in common when it comes to sex?\n* Why do hourglass-shaped women tend to be especially fertile?\n* When are women most likely to cheat?\n* Can twins have different fathers?\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1a3579a5654c1d23823ab9d4b6371dea93c3fa","amp;dn":"How+Sex+Works%3A+Why+We+Look%2C+Smell%2C+Taste%2C+Feel%2C+and+Act+the+Way+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1a3579a5654c1d23823ab9d4b6371dea93c3fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,26,53,121,165,101,76,29,35,130,58,185,212,182,55,29,234,147,195,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
