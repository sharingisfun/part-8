Released in 1967 the album sounds    **\n*just as fresh and exciting today as it did then. A mix of blues, rock and jazz,**\n*together with the voice and lyrics of Jim Morrison made the album one of the   **\n*greatest debut albums of all time. \t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*By the use of interviews, musical demonstration, rare archive footage and live **\n*performances, the program tells the story behind the conception and recording  **\n*of this groundbreaking album. The surviving members of the Doors share their   **\n*memories of the bands early days, the making of this album, and throw essential**\n*light onto living with the lyrical genius Jim Morrison.\t\t\t**\n*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*With musical demonstrations from Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore **\n*we hear some of the elements that went into creating the unique sound of the   **\n*Doors.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*In exclusive interviews the leading players in this story add insight to the \t**\n*Doors as musicians, composers and leaders of a generation.

Further insight is provided by musicians Henry **\n*Rollins, Perry Farrell, legendary Los Angeles DJ Jim Ladd, fellow film student **\n*Paul Ferrara, and music writer Ben Fong Torres. Bruce Botnick, the engineer on **\n*this and every subsequent Doors album, guides us through the process of how it **\n*was recorded.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n*There have been many myths buit up around the Doors, and Jim Morrison in \t**\n*particular. In this program which features cuts from &quot;Break On Through (To The **\n*Other Side),&quot; &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; &quot;End Of The Night,&quot; &quot;Alabama Song,&quot; &quot;The\t**\n*Chrystal Ship,&quot; &quot;Back Door Man,&quot; &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and &quot;The End,&quot; the music takes **\n*center stage, confirming the undeniable fact that the Doors eponymous record   **\n*was and remains a true Classic Album.\t\t\t\t\t\t**\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************************************************************\n****************************This torrent also includes:***************************\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************BONUS MATERIAL:*********************************\n**********************************************************************************\n*Contains over 38 minutes of additional material not included in the TV broadcast*\n*Running time of both movies together is about 88 minutes.************************\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************Video Details:**********************************\n**********************************************************************************\nFrame Width:\t\t720\nFrame Height:\t\t480\nData Rate:\t\t1566kbps\nTotal Bitrate:\t\t1726kbps\nFrame Rate:\t\t29frames/second\nCodec:\t\t\tDivX AVI\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************Audio Details:**********************************\n**********************************************************************************\nBit Rate:\t\t160kbps\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate:\t48kHz\n**********************************************************************************\n**************************************Other:**************************************\nClassic Albums - The Doors runs 50 minutes and is about 468mb.\nClassic Albums - The Doors DVD Extras runs about 38 minutes and is about 192mb.\n**********************************************************************************\n**********************************************************************************\nI uploaded this torrent because I noticed it was not on The Pirate Bay.\nThis is my FIRST torrent.\nThs has been made possible by:\nJugzG0nn4G3tY4.\n**********************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84ef2bc34484e69bd20393f4c3782bbc27520ff5","amp;dn":"Classic+Albums+-+The+Doors...+the+definitive+story+of+the+album.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84ef2bc34484e69bd20393f4c3782bbc27520ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,239,43,195,68,132,230,155,210,3,147,244,195,120,43,188,39,82,15,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
