He wanders into the midst of the Riel Rebellion, in which MÃƒÂ©tis (people of French and Native heritage) and Natives want a separate nation. Dusty falls for nurse April Logan, who is also loved by Mountie Jim Brett. April's brother is involved with Courbeau's daughter Louvette, which leads to trouble during the battles between the rebels and the Mounties. Through it all Dusty is determined to bring Corbeau back to Texas (and April, too, if he can manage it.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8846abd27eb562241d6757852e59d1054f131fef","amp;dn":"North+West+Mounted+Police++%28Western+1940%29++Gary+Cooper%2C+Madelein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8846abd27eb562241d6757852e59d1054f131fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,70,171,210,126,181,98,36,29,103,87,133,46,89,209,5,79,19,31,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
