Players will take part in The Russian trophy, Off-Road\nTrial, Thai Trophy and many other events through the worst driving\nconditions with a variety of natural obstacles like swamps, rocks\nsnow and sand. No other game features this variety of off-road sport\nvehicles including tuned stock SUVs and trucks, as well as several\nclasses of prototypes specifically built for off-road driving. The\nvehicles can be equipped with an assortment of special cross-country\nequipment and accessories including winches, low gear, differential\ngear locking, clinometer, altimeter, tire air pressure control, sand\ntracks, etc\n\nThere has never been such an innovative simulation of interactive\nterrain response as well. Terrain under the vehicle will act just like\nit does in real life, the car will sink in dirt, the dirt will create a\nrut and will stick to the car and tires affecting its handling. Stones\nwill fly from underneath the wheels and damage other trucks. The game\nwill feature various surfaces that will not only affect tire friction\nbut have complex reactions based on car weight, speed, wheel torque\ntire condition, time on this surface, depth of car immersion into the\nsurface and much more\n\nFeatures:\n\nLeading international off-road championships\n\nRacing and mud bogging\n\nTough challenges and obstacles to beat\n\nSpecial off-road equipment and accessories (Lowered gearing, front/rear\nlocking differentials, winch, etc.)\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n2.
