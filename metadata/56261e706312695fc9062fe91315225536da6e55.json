Different cultures have different perspectives on what it means to be creative, yet it is nearly always the American or Western perspective that is represented in the psychological literature. The goal of this handbook is to present a truly international and diverse set of perspectives on the psychology of human creativity. Distinguished international scholars have contributed to this book's chapters on the history and current state of creativity research and theory in their respective parts of the world. Much of the work discussed has never before been available in English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56261e706312695fc9062fe91315225536da6e55","amp;dn":"The+International+Handbook+of+Creativity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56261e706312695fc9062fe91315225536da6e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,38,30,112,99,18,105,95,201,6,47,233,19,21,34,85,54,218,110,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
