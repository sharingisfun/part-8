Though Highway to Hell offers catchier tunes and Back in Black was the commercial behemoth, Flick of the Switch is the band at its most uncompromising, loaded with writhing electric-guitar work, seething energy, groove, and a darker touch. From the bone-rattling power chords of &quot;Rising Power&quot; to the lumbering drive of &quot;Guns for Hire&quot;, AC/DC sounds metallic and tough, Brian Johnson taking his ragged vocal style to its limit (before he turned into the hoarse, oddly interesting, yet not-for-all-tastes screech in the '90s). Possibly my favourite of the Brian Johnson AC/DC albums, even if it's less commercial, less anthemic, and less hook-laden than Back in Black. \n\nby D.
