The protagonist of the film takes us on a journey to discover life in Athens, through meeting numerous pedestrians and eating lots of fruit along the way. Adapted by the bestselling novel of the same name, THE FRUIT TREES OF ATHENS uncovers human connection through literature, travel and fruit, all through the bumbling misunderstandings of the hero, played to perfection by Greek actor and Athens native Lefteris Vogiatzis.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LajIBAAeC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LajIBAAeC&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat            : AVI at 2035 Kbps\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 26mn 29s 320ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1835 Kbps\nAspect            : 704 x 400 (1.760) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e64603eff76c1f137be41930122bbd8702a91e4","amp;dn":"Ta+Oporofora+tis+Athinas+2010+Greek+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e64603eff76c1f137be41930122bbd8702a91e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,100,96,62,255,118,193,241,55,190,65,147,1,34,187,216,112,42,145,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
