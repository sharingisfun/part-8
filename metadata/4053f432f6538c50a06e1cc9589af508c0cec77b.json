Because the most popular\nalgorithms frequently change, it is increasingly important for researchers\nand implementors to have a basic understanding of the principles of image\nsynthesis. Focusing on theory, Andrew Glassner provides a comprehensive\nexplanation of the three core fields of study that come together to form\ndigital image synthesis: the human visual system, digital signal\nprocessing, and the interaction of matter and light. Assuming no more than\na basic background in calculus, Glassner transforms his passion and\nexpertise into a thorough presentation of each of these disciplines, and\ntheir elegant orchestration into modern rendering techniques such as\nradiosity and ray tracing.\nAbout the Author\nAndrew Glassner's contributions to computer graphics span 20 years. His work at Microsoft Research, Xerox PARC, the IBM Watson Research Labs, Bell Communications Research, and the Delft University of Technology has produced numerous technical articles on rendering theory and practice, animation, modeling, and new media. He currently creates new computer graphics tools at Microsoft Research. Among his recent work is Chicken Crossing, a 3D animated short film that has been shown internationally at film festivals and on television, and Dead Air, an interactive game for play over the Internet. Dr. Glassner is the author of the two volume bible, Principles of Digital Image Synthesis and 3D Computer Graphics: A Handbook for Artists and Designers. He has also edited An Introduction to Ray Tracing, and created the Graphics Gems series for programmers.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4053f432f6538c50a06e1cc9589af508c0cec77b","amp;dn":"%5BAndrew_S._Glassner%5DPrinciples+of+Digital+Image+Synthesis%28pdf%29%7BZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4053f432f6538c50a06e1cc9589af508c0cec77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,83,244,50,246,83,140,80,160,110,28,201,88,154,245,8,192,206,199,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
