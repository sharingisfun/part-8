This book can be used for analysis as well as for composition. On the one hand, it has the practical objective of introducing students to the process of composing in a systematic way, from the smallest to the largest forms; on the other hand, the author analyzes in detail, with numerous illustrations, those particular sections in the works of the masters which relate to the compositional problem under discussion.\n\nPaperback: 240 pages\nPublisher: Faber and Faber (March 15, 1999)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0571196586\nISBN-13: 978-0571196586","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a26468ee306966cb1bc8441d3759c44d8614d6c","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Musical+Composition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a26468ee306966cb1bc8441d3759c44d8614d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,38,70,142,227,6,150,108,177,188,132,65,211,117,156,68,216,97,77,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
