This simple romantic tragedy begins in 1957. Guy Foucher (Nino Castelnuovo), a 20-year-old French auto mechanic, has fallen in love with 17-year-old GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve Emery (a luminous Catherine Deneuve), an employee in her widowed mother's chic but financially embattled umbrella shop. On the evening before Guy is to leave for a two-year tour of combat in Algeria, he and GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve make love. She becomes pregnant and must choose between waiting for Guy's return or accepting an offer of marriage from a wealthy diamond merchant (Marc Michel, reprising his role from Demy's masterful debut, Lola). A completely sung movie, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is closest in form to a cinematic opera. Composer Michel Legrand composed the score, modeling it around the patterns of everyday conversation. Umbrellas was re-released in 1997. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058450/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058450/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58450/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-58450/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:27:37\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x416  1.73:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 2370 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,32 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6865f1c7142ca58e6c03fbedb0068a44de92321d","amp;dn":"The+Umbrellas+of+Cherbourg+%281964%29+Catherine+Deneuve+Fr+Engsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6865f1c7142ca58e6c03fbedb0068a44de92321d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,101,241,199,20,44,165,142,108,3,251,237,176,6,138,68,222,146,50,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
