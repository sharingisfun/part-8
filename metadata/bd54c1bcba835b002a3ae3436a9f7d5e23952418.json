Lewis, Evelyn Dorothy Oliver \n\nVisible Ink Press | English | 2009-05-01 | ISBN: 157859216X | 450 pages | PDF | 8 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the fascinating world of dreams, this comprehensive reference examines more than 250 dream-related topics, from art to history to science, including how factors such as self-healing, ESP, literature, religion, sex, cognition and memory, and medical conditions can all have an effect on dreams. \n\n\nDream symbolism and interpretation is examined in historical, cultural, and psychological detail, while a dictionaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½updated with 1,000 symbols and explanationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½offers further insights. Dreaming about teeth, for instance, can indicate control issues, and dreaming of a zoo can indicate that the dreamer needs to tidy up some situation. Examining these concepts and more, this is the ultimate dreamer's companion.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd54c1bcba835b002a3ae3436a9f7d5e23952418","amp;dn":"The+Dream+Encyclopedia+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd54c1bcba835b002a3ae3436a9f7d5e23952418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,84,193,188,186,131,91,0,42,58,227,67,106,159,125,94,35,149,36,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
