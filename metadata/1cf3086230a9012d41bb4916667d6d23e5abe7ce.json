Renowned as a scholar and translator of Nietzsche, he also wrote extensively on a broad range of other subjects, such as authenticity and death, the background and development of existentialism, ancient Greek tragedy, theism and atheism, Christianity and Judaism, as well as the deep relationships between philosophy, religion, and poetry.  Kaufmann's work is a unique blend of scholarship and critique that emphasizes the emancipation of the self-empowered, creative and socially responsible individual.\n\nIn addition to several works by Kaufmann, this collection includes two classic anthologies edited by him: EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE (1956) provides basic writings of Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Rilke, Kafka, Jaspers, Heidegger, Sartre, and Camus; and RELIGION FROM TOLSTOY TO CAMUS (1964), a compilation of significant texts on religious thought.  Both texts feature valuable introductory essays.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format, all of which are improved versions of older scans in which the page images have been completely reprocessed with contents in bookmarks and accurate pagination.\n\n* EXISTENTIALISM FROM DOSTOEVSKY TO SARTRE (Meridian, 1956).
