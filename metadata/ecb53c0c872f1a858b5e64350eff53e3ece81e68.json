At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most popular writers in the world.\n\nZweig was a prominent writer in the 1920s and 1930s, befriending Arthur Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud. He was extremely popular in the United States, South America and Europe, and remains so in continental Europe; however, he was largely ignored by the British public, and his fame in America has since dwindled. Since the 1990s there has been an effort on the part of several publishers (notably Pushkin Press and The New York Review of Books) to get Zweig back into print in English. Plunkett Lake Press Ebooks has begun to publish electronic versions of his non-fiction as well.\n\nCriticism over his oeuvre is severely divided between some English-speaking critics, who despise his literary style as poor, lightweight and superficial, and some of those more attached to the European tradition, who praise his humanism, simplicity and effective style.\n\nZweig is best known for his novellas (notably The Royal Game, Amok, Letter from an Unknown Woman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ filmed in 1948 by Max OphÃƒÂ¼ls), novels (Beware of Pity, Confusion of Feelings, and the posthumously published The Post Office Girl) and biographies (notably Erasmus of Rotterdam, Conqueror of the Seas: The Story of Magellan, and Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles and also posthumously published, Balzac). At one time his works were published without his consent in English under the pseudonym 'Stephen Branch' (a translation of his real name) when anti-German sentiment was running high. His biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette was later adapted for a Hollywood movie, starring the actress Norma Shearer in the title role.\n\nZweig's autobiography, The World of Yesterday, was completed in 1942 on the day before he committed suicide. It has been widely discussed as a record of &quot;what it meant to be alive between 1881 and 1942&quot; in central Europe; the book has attracted both critical praise and hostile dismissal.\n\nZweig enjoyed a close association with Richard Strauss, and provided the libretto for Die schweigsame Frau (The Silent Woman). Strauss famously defied the Nazi regime by refusing to sanction the removal of Zweig's name from the programme for the work's premiÃƒÂ¨re on June 24, 1935 in Dresden. As a result, Goebbels refused to attend as planned, and the opera was banned after three performances. Zweig later collaborated with Joseph Gregor, to provide Strauss with the libretto for one other opera, Daphne, in 1937. At leastmone other work by Zweig received a musical setting: the pianist and composer Henry Jolles, who like Zweig had fled to Brazil to escape the Nazis, composed a song, &quot;ÃƒÅ¡ltimo poema de Stefan Zweig&quot;, based on &quot;Letztes Gedicht&quot;, which Zweig wrote on the occasion of his 60th birthday in November 1941. During his stay in Brazil, Zweig wrote Brasilien, Ein Land der Zukunft (Brazil, Land of the Future) which was an accurate analysis of his newly adopted country and in his book he managed to demonstrate a fair understanding of the Brazilian culture that surrounded him.\n\nZweig was a passionate collector of manuscripts. There are important Zweig collections at the British Library and at the State University of New York at Fredonia. The British Library's Stefan Zweig Collection was donated to the library by his heirs in May 1986. It specialises in autograph music manuscripts, including works by Bach, Haydn, Wagner, and Mahler. It has been described as &quot;one of the world's greatest collections of autograph manuscripts&quot;.One particularly precious item is Mozart's &quot;VerzeichnÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÅ¸ aller meiner Werke&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is, the composer's own handwritten thematic catalogue of his works.\n\nThe 1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1994 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format unless otherwise stated:\n\n* Beware of Pity \n\n* Burning Secret\n\n* Chess\n\n* Confusion\n\n* Fantastic Night &amp; Other Stories\n\n* Fear\n\n* Journey into the Past \n\n* Kaleidoscope Two -- PDF\n\n* Letter from an Unknown Woman and Other Stories\n \n* The Governess and Other Stories\n\n* The Post Office Girl\n\n\nRead the following articles, check out the websites, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stefanzweig.org/en/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stefanzweig.org/en/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Zweig&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Zweig&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2014/04/02/298340082/the-rise-and-fall-of-stefan-zweig-who-inspired-grand-budapest-hotel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2014/04/02/298340082/the-rise-and-fall-of-stefan-zweig-who-inspired-grand-budapest-hotel&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10684250/I-stole-from-Stefan-Zweig-Wes-Anderson-on-the-author-who-inspired-his-latest-movie.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10684250/I-stole-from-Stefan-Zweig-Wes-Anderson-on-the-author-who-inspired-his-latest-movie.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb53c0c872f1a858b5e64350eff53e3ece81e68","amp;dn":"Stefan+Zweig+-+Novels+and+Short+Stories+%2811+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb53c0c872f1a858b5e64350eff53e3ece81e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,181,60,12,135,47,26,133,139,94,100,53,14,255,83,227,236,232,30,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
