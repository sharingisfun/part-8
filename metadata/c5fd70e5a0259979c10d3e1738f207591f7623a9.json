This DVD appears unprotected and region code free for all applications and the Windows operating system as well. AnyDVD works in the background to automatically remove the copy protection of a DVD movie as soon as it's inserted into the drive, allowing you then to backup the movie using a DVD backup tool such as CloneDVD and CloneDVD mobile. You can also remove the RPC region code, thereby making the movie region free and viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player software.\nAnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent 'PC-friendly' software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD.\n\nDecryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays.\nBut AnyDVD doesn't just stop at DVDs. It also decrypts protected audio CDs to allow you to copy them.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIBM-compatible PC with a minimum 2 GHz Pentium-class microprocessor and 512 MB RAM\nWindows 2000/XP/XP64/VISTA/VISTA64/Win7/Win7-64/Win8/Win8-64\nFor Blu-ray or HD DVD media, a Blu-ray or HD DVD compliant drive is required.\nFor HD decryption and ripping, the minimum OS is Windows 2000 (latest SP).\nPC player software usually requires Windows XP SP2 as minumum OS.\n\nHomepage: http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvdhd.html\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program.\n- Patching instructions given in crack folder\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5fd70e5a0259979c10d3e1738f207591f7623a9","amp;dn":"SlySoft+AnyDVD+%26amp%3B+AnyDVD+HD+7.1.4.0+Incl+Crack+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5fd70e5a0259979c10d3e1738f207591f7623a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,253,112,229,160,37,153,121,193,13,62,23,56,242,7,89,31,118,35,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
