Go ahead and virus scan \n\nthe files. Please leave a comment if you think you like \n\nwhat is in the content. Like if you downloaded and had no viruses and that the content is legit. :) Yes there is a ad on the link. There are alot of dead torrents for this type of thing and this should be easy to keep seeding.\n\nBut its not like a gay survey ad where it locks it. So go ahead and give it a try. There are tons of ways to make devices to extract potential energy from the environment around you. If your a hobbiest and want to experiment for education purposes or if your are going full scale this is the torrent for you. I've looked in these files and I think i can conclude with all these schematics, plans, and ideas that they were being sold for $300! So instead of paying $300 for something that should be free you can get annoyed by one 10 second ad. :) The reason I did not put all the files on this torrent or the link itself because I can't seed and keep my pc on forever and if the torrent shows Low seeds it looks unattractive to download. But give it a try and if you find a virus go ahead and spam the comments with i found a virus. yadadada! It should be easy to seed since its only a text file and only a few bytes big.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b65fbc61acdf6974819db4a015c62e6aa1e9e59","amp;dn":"Free+energy+device+schematics%2Fplans%2Fhistory+Link+to+dropbox+acco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b65fbc61acdf6974819db4a015c62e6aa1e9e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,101,251,198,26,205,246,151,72,25,219,74,1,92,98,230,170,30,158,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
