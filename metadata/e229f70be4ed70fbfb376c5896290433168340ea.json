It is the first game in the series to be developed and published by Namco Bandai Games after Namco Tales Studio was dissolved earlier in 2012, though the core development staff remains the same.[1] It is a direct sequel to Tales of Xillia, taking place one year after the events of the original. Like its predecessor, it also features a theme song sung by Ayumi Hamasaki, called &quot;Song 4 u&quot;. The game was released in Japan on November 1, 2012 in Japan for the PlayStation 3. While not announced for release in any other regions, series producer, Hideo Baba says there's a &quot;good chance&quot; of an international release if the original game sells well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e229f70be4ed70fbfb376c5896290433168340ea","amp;dn":"tales+of+xillia+2+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e229f70be4ed70fbfb376c5896290433168340ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,41,247,11,228,237,112,251,251,55,108,88,150,41,4,51,22,131,64,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
