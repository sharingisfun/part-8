The time has come for us to add one more name to the pantheon of great Malian artists.\n-- The Observer (*****)\n\nSimply magnificent and a truly important recording that deserves the widest of exposure.\n-- Music-News.com\n\nThe agreeable tension between the abrasive roots elements and the overlay of Western production values is what makes this such a resonant listen.\n-- The Independent\n\nWith Mali Koura, Bagayogo delivers 11 songs that are not only rhythmically compelling, but also stretch his sound in the direction of jazz.\n-- New Music Reviews\n\nWith Mali Koura Techno Issa takes a quantum leap.\n-- AllMusic.com (****)\n\nIt's the juxtaposition of [...] European elements with the buzz and clang of the kamalengoni and the polyrhythmic clatter of African percussion that makes this album so compelling.\n-- SongLines\n\n\nThe hate reviews -\n\n[...] put me into a sleep where I dreamed that this was a transitional record to a mature phase. Then I woke up and thought a transition anywhere might be desirable.\n-- Pop Matters\n\nCrucially, too many of Wernhert and fellow keyboard player/guitarist Gael Le Billan's contributions sound like generic noodling.\n-- All About Jazz\n\nYou be the judge :)\n\nTracks\n01- Sebero\n02- Filaw\n03- Poye\n04- Tcheni Tchemakan\n05- Dibi\n06- Dunu Kan\n07- N'Tana\n08- Ahe Sira Bila\n09- Namadjidja\n10- Fimani\n11- M'Ba Fodi\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan), EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c82a5fa7ce288b34fdfd3d114ca91b9b34ddad","amp;dn":"Issa+Bagayogo+-+Mali+Koura+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c82a5fa7ce288b34fdfd3d114ca91b9b34ddad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,200,42,95,167,206,40,139,52,253,253,61,17,76,169,27,155,52,221,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
