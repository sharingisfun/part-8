Starting as single-celled yellow organisms, Minions evolve through the ages, perpetually serving the most despicable of masters. After accidentally killing off so many of themÃ¢â‚¬â€from T. rex to NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â€the Minions find themselves without a master to serve and fall into a deep depression. Featuring a soundtrack of hit music from the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s that still permeates our culture today, Minions is produced by IlluminationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and is directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. Brian Lynch has written the screenplay for the 3D-CG comedy adventure, and Chris Renaud serves as executive producer of the film.\n\nDirector: Pierre Coffin, Kyle Balda\n\nWriters: Brian Lynch\n\nActors: Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm\n\nGenre: Comedy, Action and Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21e756f70defa768100a455903d09364f936109d","amp;dn":"Minions.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21e756f70defa768100a455903d09364f936109d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,231,86,247,13,239,167,104,16,10,69,89,3,208,147,100,249,54,16,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
