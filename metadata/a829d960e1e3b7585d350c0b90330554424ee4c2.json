It was designed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1, programmed by Intelligent Systems, and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. The game was released in Japan in March 1994, in North America in April 1994, and in Europe in July 1994. It was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. Under development for 18 months, Super Metroid was directed by Yoshio Sakamoto and produced by Makoto Kano with Gunpei Yokoi serving as general manager. The game's story follows Samus Aran as she attempts to retrieve a stolen Metroid from the Space Pirates.\n\nThe game was given near-universal acclaim, receiving an aggregated score of 96% from Game Rankings, making it the website's 19th highest-rated game. Electronic Gaming Monthly named it the Game of the Month for May 1994, gave it an Editor's Choice Award, awarded it as the Best Action Game of 1994, and named it the Best Game of All Time in 2003. In 2007, IGN ranked Super Metroid 7th in its list of Top 100 Games of All Time. Despite a positive critical reaction, the game sold poorly in Japan, but fared better in North America and Europe. Nevertheless, due to the game's critical success, Nintendo placed it on their Player's Choice marketing label.\n\n\n\n\nHow to play\n...........\n\n1.
