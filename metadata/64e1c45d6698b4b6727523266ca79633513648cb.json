Although, to be fair, the Minneapolis duo never really took that much time off from the road. They also found plenty of time to record two projects, 2008\\'s free Leak At Will EP and 2010\\'s double-EP, To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy. The latter continued the live band-sound heard on When Life Gives You Lemons while further expanding Slug\\'s lyrical content. While it hasn\\'t been confirmed, you can expect more of that on The Family Sign, the rapper\\'s sixth album with producer Ant. Also, if the title in any indication, perhaps we will hear even more about Slug\\'s family life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e1c45d6698b4b6727523266ca79633513648cb","amp;dn":"Atmosphere+-+The+Family+Sign","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e1c45d6698b4b6727523266ca79633513648cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,225,196,93,102,152,180,182,114,117,35,38,108,167,150,51,81,54,72,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
