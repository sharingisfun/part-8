Yet many practitioners begin seeing couples without extensive training in couples work. To fill this gap in their therapeutic repertoires, noted couples therapist Michele Harway brings together other wellÃ¢â‚¬â€œknown experts in marriage and family therapy to offer the Handbook of Couples Therapy, a comprehensive guide to the study and practice of couples therapy. The book2s chapters provide a variety of perspectives along developmental, theoretical, and situational lines. Recognizing the need for clinically proven, evidenceÃ¢â‚¬â€œbased approaches, chapters provide detailed coverage of the most effective treatment modes. Couples at different stages of the lifecycle feature prominently in the text, as do relevant special issues and treatment approaches for each stage. Subjects covered include: Premarital counseling from the PAIRS perspective (an extensive curriculum of interventions for premarital couples) The first years of marital commitment Couples with young children Couples with adolescents Therapy with older couples Same sex couples A variety of theoretical approaches, including CognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œBehavioral, Object Relational, Narrative, Integrative, and Feminist and Contextual Special issues and situations, including serious illness, physical aggression, addiction, infidelity, and religious/spiritual commitments or conflicts Providing a diverse set of treatment approaches suited to working with a wide range of adult populations, the Handbook of Couples Therapy is an essential resource for mental health professionals working with couples.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afc86415f9870fa74fc6eeeb9422235f603ad8e","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+couples+therapy.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afc86415f9870fa74fc6eeeb9422235f603ad8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,252,134,65,95,152,112,250,116,252,110,238,185,66,34,53,246,3,173,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
