The Seekers were at the head of the British Invasion's acoustic folk-rock division, right there with Peter &amp; Gordon and Chad &amp; Jeremy but without the personal Beatles connection of the former and more successful than either -- they scored a string of number one hits in England and Top Ten successes in America that lasted into 1967, two years later than most of the rest of the British exports to this country. They played acoustic instruments (even the upright bass), and they were closer in image and inspiration to the likes of the Rooftop Singers (&quot;Walk Right In&quot;), the New Christy Minstrels (&quot;Green Green,&quot; etc.), or Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, than to the Beatles or even the Searchers, yet they managed to hang onto young listeners, as well as older teenagers and their parents, with songs like &quot;I'll Never Find Another You,&quot; &quot;A World of Our Own,&quot; &quot;Come the Day,&quot; or &quot;Georgy Girl.&quot; ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifixqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:wifixqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe Seekers' folk-pop sound formed a bridge between the Kingston Trio and the Association, putting the Australian quartet in the same international quasi-folk neighborhood as the Sandpipers and Peter &amp; Gordon. &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; and &quot;I'll Never Find Another You&quot; were the group's two big hits, but their repertoire included everything from traditional folk songs and spirituals to pure pop. With strummy acoustic guitars and intricate vocal arrangements, the Seekers paved the way for the folk-oriented pop vocal groups that followed, from the aforementioned Association to the 5th Dimension. Capitol Collectors Series is a 23-track anthology that presents their hits and more, with several excellent tracks among the obscurities. Seekers fanatics will want the Australian complete recordings box set, but this collection is more than adequate for everyone else. Keep listening after the last song for the unlisted bonus track: a vintage Seekers radio ad for Coca-Cola.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. I'll Never Find Another You\n02. Open Up Them Pearly Gates\n03.
