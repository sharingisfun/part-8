Life has gotten very busy for me.  But since yesterday's 20th bundle seeded in almost record time, and since I was able to free up a little of my morning today, I thought I'd keep the momentum going with another torrent.\n\nAs always, please enjoy the music, share it with your family friends and neighbors, support those musicians you intend on keeping, and above all else, praise God for whom it was all written.
