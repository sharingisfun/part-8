The grifter classÃ¢â‚¬â€made up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their biddingÃ¢â‚¬â€has been growing in power, and the crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve hijacked AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political and economic life.\n\nMatt Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing account yet written of this ongoing American crisis. He offers fresh reporting on the backroom deals of the bailout; tells the story of Goldman Sachs, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and uncovers the hidden commodities bubble that transferred billions of dollars to Wall Street while creating food shortages around the world.\n\nThis is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the labyrinthine inner workings of this country, and the profound consequences for us all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10b67329bed8db5c735389b939c79ead268cc924","amp;dn":"Griftopia%3A+Bubble+Machines%2C+Vampire+Squids%2C+and+the+Long+Con+Tha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10b67329bed8db5c735389b939c79ead268cc924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,182,115,41,190,216,219,92,115,83,137,185,57,199,158,173,38,140,201,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
