Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in American culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation agreements. It was not until the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when IsraelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it enjoys today. Leaders of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of NazismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket. Thoroughly researched and closely argued, The Holocaust Industry is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.\n\nIn a devastating new postscript to this best-selling book, Norman G. Finkelstein documents the Holocaust industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scandalous cover-up of the blackmail of Swiss banks, and in a new appendix demolishes an influential apologia for the Holocaust industry.\n\n286 pages\nPublisher: Verso; Second Edition edition (October 17, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 185984488X\nISBN-13: 978-1859844885","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f637f5b81e49ec8ff48fbe642a25bc54e25d9797","amp;dn":"The+Holocaust+Industry+%5B2nd+Ed%5D+%282003%29+by+Norman+Finkelstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f637f5b81e49ec8ff48fbe642a25bc54e25d9797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,55,245,184,30,73,236,143,244,143,190,100,42,37,188,84,226,93,151,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
