Led by Dr. Grant Gilmore of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, a group of American scientists and ichthyologists participated in this cooperative research mission along with a team of Cuban scientists aboard the Seward Johnson research vessel. The scientists made numerous dives in a sophisticated, deep-sea submersible known as the Johnson Sea Link, which is capable of diving up to 2500 feet below the water's surface. The team of scientists found new marine species, searched rich coral reefs, and investigated marine life that may hold cures to diseases.\n\n5)  Forbidden Depths - Part 2 \nUsing sophisticated underwater technology U.S. and Cuban sclentists explore the rich but relatively unknown waters off the coast of Cuba. With underwater photographer Al Giddings and the submersible from Discovery Channel's landmark voyage to Galapagos, this rich underwater site is explored the first time.The scientists on board include Shirley Pomponi, a sponge expert; Tammy Frank, who studies shrimp-like species to understand adaptability; and Edie Vidder, a bioluminescence expert. The expedition identifies species new to the region and new to science.\n\nNarrator: Martin Sheen\nProducers &amp; Directors: James Lipscomb, Al Giddings\nExecutive Producers, Discovery Communications: Bill\nCosmas, Michael Ouattrone\nIn Association with James Lipscomb Inc.\n1998 Discovery Communicetions, Inc.\n\n6)  Great White Down under \nOf all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the Great White Shark. Nowhere on earth is the Great White more dreaded than on the island continent of Australia, where the vast majority of people live along the coastline, a mere stones throw from over 170 species of sharks. In Australia, the coexistence between humans and sharks is not a choice, but a necessity. This programme examines the history of the White Shark in Australia, from gruesome encounters with humans to the Iatest research. Now, by catching White Sharks and implanting transmitters into thern, researchers are tracking these predators and understanding for the first time where they go and what they do.\n\nNarrator: Malcolm McDowell\nDirector: Jody Helzer, Jed Udall\nProducers: Thomas F.

He follows their 3-month migration to the herring-rich waters off Alaska, where they hunt in packs. Giddings, experienced producer of underwater scenes of documentaries and feature films including Cameron's recent Titanic, returns to documentaries to featue information gathered about Humpbacks over several decades.\n\nNarrator: Susan Sarandon\nProducers &amp; Directors: Al Giddings &amp; David Clark\nExecutive Producers: Michael Quattrone, Tim\nCowling, Steven Manuel\nA Presentation of Discovery Channel in\nassociation with Al Giddings Images, Inc.\n1998 Discovery Communicatione, Inc.\n\n8)  The Free Willy Story - Keiko's Journey Home \nThis is the story of Keiko, the Orca Whale that starred in the movie Free Willy, and his journey home to the coastal waters of Iceland.

Zipping around in an inflatable boat, responding to sightings phoned in to a hotline, Visser tracks pods of the animals as they cavort gracefully in the scenic waters of northern New Zealand. During her years of tracking the animals, Visser has been able to identify individual killer whales, or orcas, and we even see her interacting with one wild killer whale that seems to recognize and greet her. For many years, humans believed that killer whales would attack humans, but that fear turns out to be unfounded. Visser is usually in close proximity to the large creatures in the wild, but in underwater footage she is seen actually swimming among them. An energetic and engaging subject for a documentary, Visser displays a spirit in tracking the whales that is infectious. In interview segments she explains her fascination for the orcas, and provides insights into their behavior and her fears for their future as manmade pollution begins to seriously threaten their habitats.\n\nNarrator: Ralph Cosman\nProducer &amp; Director : Andrew Penniket\nProduction Executive : Michael Stedman\nExecutive Producer : Neil Harraway\nA Presentation of Discovery Channel in\nassociation with TVNZ Natural History\n1997 Discovery Communications Inc.\n\n10)  Sharks of the Deep Blue \nTwo fierce predators, the Oceanic White Tip Shark that inhabits deep offshore waters and the Bull Shark that patrois the murky shallows of rivers and estuaries, are examined.

Using their cameras for defence, they demonsrrate how to survive an encounter with the predator responsible for the deaths of hundreds of shipwreck victims, including those of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\n\nIn the shallow Bahaman waters, a scientist shows how to avoid being attacked by Buil Sharks using relaxation methods and body language techniques.\n\nNarrator: Malcolm McDowell\nDirector: Jeff Kurr\nProducers: Thomas F.
