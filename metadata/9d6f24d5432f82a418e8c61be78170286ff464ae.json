Some I did rip from my own albums (yes I buy albums), some I downloaded. I just collected the albums and organised them in a good way. Put the map in Media Player and all should look neat and clean.\n\nAnd as always. If you like the music please buy an album or more from this great band so they can continue to make the music we all love.\n\nStay Metal.\n\nMetalian.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6f24d5432f82a418e8c61be78170286ff464ae","amp;dn":"After+Forever+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6f24d5432f82a418e8c61be78170286ff464ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,111,36,213,67,47,130,164,24,232,198,27,231,129,112,40,111,244,100,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
