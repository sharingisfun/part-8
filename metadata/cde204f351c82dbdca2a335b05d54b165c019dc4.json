The helpers will even continue to work while you are not playing the game, and some new gold should always be waiting for you on your return!\r\n\r\nIt is good to keep your eyes open though as sometimes some mean critters will invade your garden. Hunt them out yourself or invest in a guard dog to keep the order.\r\n\r\nGo up in level to unlock new plants, bushes, trees and animals and continue to expand and improve your garden!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde204f351c82dbdca2a335b05d54b165c019dc4","amp;dn":"Plantera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde204f351c82dbdca2a335b05d54b165c019dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,226,4,243,81,200,45,189,202,42,51,91,5,213,75,22,92,1,157,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
