The film concerns three working women living out their fantasies of getting even with, and their successful overthrow of, the company's autocratic, &quot;sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot&quot; boss.\n\n9 to 5 was a hit, grossing over $3.9 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. and is the 20th highest-grossing comedy film. As a star vehicle for singer Parton, it launched her permanently into mainstream popular culture. Although a television series based on the film was less successful, a musical version of the film (also titled 9 to 5), with new songs written by Parton, opened on Broadway on April 30, 2009.\n\n9 to 5 is number 74 on the American Film Institute's &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; and is rated &quot;82% fresh&quot; on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\nCast\n\nane Fonda\t ...\tJudy Bernly\nLily Tomlin\t ...\tViolet Newstead\nDolly Parton\t ...\tDoralee Rhodes\nDabney Coleman\t ...\tFranklin M.
