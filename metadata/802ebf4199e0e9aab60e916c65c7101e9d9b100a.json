She finds herself spending too much time staring out her window, though ... until she realizes sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotten used to seeing a young man across the street staring out his window, too.\nThey eventually embark on a hesitant romance, until she learns that he has been the victim of some form of childhood trauma. Visiting two of his friends who live a monastic life beside a beautiful lake, she begins to piece together a series of clues that lead her to suspect his experience may have had something to do with a bizarre religious cult. . . .\nWith its echoes of the infamous, real-life Aum Shinrikyo cult (the group that released poison gas in the Tokyo subway system), The Lake unfolds as the most powerful novel Banana Yoshimoto has written. And as the two young lovers overcome their troubled past to discover hope in the beautiful solitude of the lake in the country- side, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one of her most moving.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - May 3rd 2011\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802ebf4199e0e9aab60e916c65c7101e9d9b100a","amp;dn":"The+Lake+by+Banana+Yoshimoto+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802ebf4199e0e9aab60e916c65c7101e9d9b100a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,46,191,65,153,224,233,170,182,14,145,108,101,199,16,30,157,155,16,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
