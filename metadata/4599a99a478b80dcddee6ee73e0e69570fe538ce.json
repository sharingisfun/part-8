I still do not feel it is every single 3.5e book, but it is a massive chunk. I know I am most likely missing a few adventures and probably even supplements and cores, so as with the last one, please comment the missing books. I will be seeding this one probably indefinitely. I am also working on another tabletop torrent consisting of various tabletop books as a kind of starter kit, but that is probably months in the works. for now please enjoy this collection of 3.5e D&amp;D books. I also apologize for the naming mechanics as I am very lazy and have not bothered to rename them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4599a99a478b80dcddee6ee73e0e69570fe538ce","amp;dn":"Dungeons+and+dragons+3.5+edition+book+collection+v2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4599a99a478b80dcddee6ee73e0e69570fe538ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,153,169,154,71,139,128,220,221,238,110,231,62,14,105,87,15,229,56,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
