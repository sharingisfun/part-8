The transition from adaptable to evolvable and finally to self-evolvable systems is highlighted, self-properties such as self-organization, self-configuration, and self-repairing are introduced and challenges and limitations of the self-evolvable engineering systems are evaluated.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682b512ae734f0836956f89668fbb2faf4ce251c","amp;dn":"Self-Evolvable+Systems%3A+Machine+Learning+in+Social+Media","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682b512ae734f0836956f89668fbb2faf4ce251c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,43,81,42,231,52,240,131,105,86,248,150,104,251,178,250,244,206,37,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
