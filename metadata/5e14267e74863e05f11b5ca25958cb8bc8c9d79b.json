The new Jake soon finds love, something that eluded him when he was encased in flesh: he falls for the android version of Karen, a woman rediscovering all the joys of life now that she's no longer constrained by a worn-out body either.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly Karen's son sues her, claiming that by uploading into an immortal body, she has done him out of his inheritance. Even worse, the original version of Jake, consigned to die on the far side of the moon, has taken hostages there, demanding the return of his rights of personhood. In the courtroom and on the lunar surface, the future of uploaded humanity hangs in the balance.\r\n\r\nMindscan is vintage Sawyer -- a feast for the mind and the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e14267e74863e05f11b5ca25958cb8bc8c9d79b","amp;dn":"Robert+J.+Sawyer+-+Mindscan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e14267e74863e05f11b5ca25958cb8bc8c9d79b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,20,38,126,116,134,62,5,241,27,92,162,89,88,203,139,200,201,215,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
