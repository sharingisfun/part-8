The plot centers around Oyuki, an assassin who seeks vengeance against the bandits who raped her mother and murdered her father and brother, often using her sexual appeal as a weapon. Originally published in Japan in the early 1970s, it was translated and published in English by Dark Horse Comics.\n\nThe Japanese title Shurayuki-hime is apparently a pun originating from ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃ‚ÂªÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â« (Shirayuki-hime &quot;Princess Snow-White&quot;), which was the Japanese title of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Kanji character ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â®ÃƒÂ§Ã‚Â¾Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ (shura) means carnage. The title was translated into &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; because the character is connected the terms shura-no-chimata (bloodshed) and shuraba/shurajÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ &quot;scene of carnage&quot;. \n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16117ed921a5b54f0f4557683d2f0229e5359506","amp;dn":"Lady+Snowblood+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16117ed921a5b54f0f4557683d2f0229e5359506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,17,126,217,33,165,181,79,15,69,87,104,61,47,2,41,229,53,149,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
