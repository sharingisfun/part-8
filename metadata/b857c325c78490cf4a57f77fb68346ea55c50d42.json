It sweeps away the myth that the army suffered from poor morale, and that it only won its battles through the use of 'brute force' and by reverting to the techniques of the First World War. Few soldiers were actively eager to close with the enemy, but the morale of the army never collapsed and its combat capability steadily improved from 1942 onwards.\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b857c325c78490cf4a57f77fb68346ea55c50d42","amp;dn":"Raising+Churchill%27s+Army+The+British+Army+and+the+War+against+Ge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b857c325c78490cf4a57f77fb68346ea55c50d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,87,195,37,199,132,144,207,74,87,247,127,182,131,70,234,85,197,13,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
