The genre is Rhumba, Kwaito, Kalindula, Chiunda, Ragga and Reggae. In certain cases the albums are complete while others are just a pick of what was popular at the time the albums were released. The music spans from the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to somewhere around 2006.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s my thought: if we can find this mix of genre popular amongst ourselves, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m convinced that our brothers and sisters in the Western world can also appreciate the same interest that we have in our musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦if only we can market this music enough. For example, if I find Awilo Longomba appealing and danceable and at the same time I find Jay SeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Down,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ appealing and danceable, I see no reason why this canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work the other way round.\n\nMy final thought: if it ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t on TPB, it probably isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t good enough for the world!  Please seed and enjoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.. The mark of the tooth.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the complete listing of the artists in this torrent:\n\n1.\tAlfred C.
