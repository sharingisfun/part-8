No matter what changes a user makes to a workstation, simply restart to eradicate all changes and reset the computer to its original state - right down to the last byte. Expensive computer assets are kept running at 100% capacity and technical support time is reduced or eliminated completely. The result is consistent trouble-free computing on a truly protected and parallel network, completely free of harmful viruses and unwanted programs. While Deep Freeze provides bulletproof protection, its non-restrictive approach also improves user productivity and satisfaction. Placing no restrictions on a user's ability to access all system resources, users avoid the frustration of downtime due to software conflicts, operating system corruption, virus attacks, and many other problems. Users are always assured of computers that are consistently operable and available.\n\nDeep Freeze is the only solution that effectively balances workstation security with user productivity. By mapping user and application data to a Thawed (unprotected) partition or drive, users are able to store their documents, pictures, music, etc., while still enjoying the total system consistency that Deep Freeze offers.\n\nDeep Freeze offers flexible scheduling options that enable IT administrators to easily create automated update and maintenance periods. Schedule Deep Freeze to allow system and virus definition updates to occur from predefined timeseither with the Deep Freeze Enterprise Console or using your preferred third-party desktop management solution.\n\nThe Deep Freeze Enterprise Console allows administrators to install, control, and manage Deep Freeze workstations from a single remote location, and hundreds or thousands of workstations can be protected across a distributed LAN, WAN or over the Internet.\n\nDeep Freezes reboot-to-restore concept significantly lowers Total Cost of Ownership for technology assets because of a vast reduction in time and cost spent maintaining and rebuilding machines. Deep Freeze workstations can be easily controlled and configured via the GUI Enterprise Console, and require no maintenance or definition file updates.\n\nKey Features of DeepFreeze Enterprise:\n\nAbsolute Protection\nGuaranteesworkstation recovery on restart\nProvides password protection and complete security\nProtects multiple hard drives and partitions\n\nIntegration and Compatibility\nSupports multi-boot environments\nCompatible with Fast User Switching\nSupports SCSI, ATA, SATA, and IDE hard drives\nSingle install for Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP and Vista\nSupports FAT, FAT32, NTFS, basic and dynamic disks\nLocalized in five languages: English, French, German, Spanish &amp; Japanese\n\nDeployment Options\nOffers silent install option for rapid network deployment\nProvides option to deploy on multiple workstations as part of a master image\nDFC included in Workstation/Seed installations\n\nSecurity and Control\nEncrypt all components with a unique Customization Code\nPreset multiple passwords to be used on a workstation or via the Command Line Control with varying activation and expiration dates\nGenerate encrypted One Time or One Day Passwords\nDisable keyboard and mouse during maintenance periods or on demand\nBoot Control window provides ability for immediate reboot\n\nConfiguring Options\nCreate customized installation files using the Configuration Administrator\nPre-select Frozen Drives and selectively Freeze or Thaw fixed drives\nSchedule automatic Restart/Shutdown times\nRestart computer on Logoff\nShutdown workstations after a preset length of inactivity\nSchedule Thawed Maintenance periods to perform Windows updates through the Internet or a SUS/WSUS server or Anti-Virus Updates\nSchedule Send Message tasks\n\nFlexibility Options\nCreate a ThawSpace on a workstation that can be used to store programs, save files, or make permanent changes\nSpecify the size and file system of the ThawSpace (up to 100GB using NTFS)\nUse Stealth Mode to hide the Deep Freeze system tray icon\nOverride ongoing maintenance periods\n\nInteroperability Options\nUse Deep Freeze Command Line Control Utility (DFC) to manage Deep Freeze deployments remotely via command line interface\nIntegrate Deep Freeze protection into any Desktop Management Solution capable of executing command line control\nManage Deep Freeze protection through deicated plugins for LANDesk Management Suite or Novell ZENworks\n\nAction Files\nCreate XML-based Deep Freeze Action Files to interact with other programs via the Deep Freeze Console\nAdministrators will be able to create, edit, download and share Action Files with other users through Faronics Labs\n\nEnterprise Console\nSchedule restart, shutdown, Wake-On-LAN, Freeze, Thaw and Thaw Locked tasks dynamically to take place once or on a regular basis\nScheduled tasks run even when Deep Freeze Console is closed\nChange maintenance and restart/shutdown schedules on the fly\nPower-on workstations using Wake-on-LAN technology\nUse Workstation Seed for workstation communication and installation\nManage workstations easily with User Defined Groups\nQuickly populate multiple groups or sub-groups with smart automatic filters or import groups from Active Directory\nUpdate all pre-existing installation files automatically\nInvoke system maintenance on demand with Thaw Locked mode\n\nExpanded Network Options\nCommunicate with workstations over a LAN, WAN, or combination\nCreate Remote and Multiple Consoles with the Deep Freeze Server Service Manager\nSupport for multiple ports for use with Server Service Manager\nPreset passwords with activation and expiration dates\nInstantly send notification messages to workstations\n\nHomepage - http://www.deepfreeze.com\n\nSize: 5.90 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a928517c890f2b97898afd7e256557f242224f","amp;dn":"Faronics.Deep.Freeze.Standard.v6+62+020+3058+Incl+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a928517c890f2b97898afd7e256557f242224f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,169,40,81,124,137,15,43,151,137,138,253,126,37,101,87,242,66,34,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
