Chairmen of the Board are one of five artists featured from the Invictus/Hot Wax stable, founded by the writing/production trio of Holland, Dozier and Holland. They struck out on their own after scoring hits with innumerable Motown acts; you can hear a touch of Stevie Wonder in 'Finders Keepers'. From Detroit we travel to New Jersey for our collection's title track, performed by female vocal duo Positive Force, which wrote their name in the last UK chart of the decade. \r\nIf it's dance music with a heavy bass line and layered guitar, keyboard and vocals you're after, look no further - 'We Got The Funk'!\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/LuMRHsi.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
