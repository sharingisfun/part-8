It's the popular new crochet craze from Japan that uses the double ring technique to make tiny, cuddly, and very unusual crocheted toys and novelties. Tasty Cute, the latest in author Annie Obaachan's series of amigurumi books, gives detailed directions for making truly unique and absolutely eye-catching crocheted toys that will delight children and amuse friends. This book's focus is on bright, colorful imitation food items--a miniature pizza, a hamburger with lettuce and tomato, an ice cream sundae, French macaroons, and 21 more creations that look very appetizing but are made entirely of crochet yarn. Instructions for all projects are presented with lists of required yarns in various colors, as well as crochet hooks, and supplementary materials. Directions for the projects come with large color illustrations of all finished pieces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f6c67764418ed9f17510bca09717c750ff561c","amp;dn":"Tasty+Cute%3A+25+Amigurumi+Gourmet+Treats+to+Crochet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f6c67764418ed9f17510bca09717c750ff561c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,246,198,119,100,65,142,217,241,117,16,188,160,151,23,199,80,255,86,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
