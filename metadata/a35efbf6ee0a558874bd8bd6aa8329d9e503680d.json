With a tip of the hat to their musical\npeers and influences, Finch confidently push at the\nboundaries set before them. The result of their\ncollective labours is 'What It Is To Burn', a soaring\nbaker's-dozen collection of tracks that simply shimmer\nwith sincerity. Ranging between emo-oriented melodies,\npunk rhythm, pop hooks and aggressive hardcore\nbreakdowns, it covers the entire emotional spectrum. Not\nunlike Glassjaw, Deftones and Jimmy Eat World, Finch\nembrace disparate influences within their music - the\ndifferences create a stronger whole.\n'....too day-swallowing to be confined to the\nunderground. 'What It Is To Burn' could go down as one of\n02's classics - Metal Hammer\n\nuk retail of this nice album with 2 added bonus tracks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a35efbf6ee0a558874bd8bd6aa8329d9e503680d","amp;dn":"Finch+-+What+it+is+to+burn+-+UK+Retail+-+2002+-+SSR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a35efbf6ee0a558874bd8bd6aa8329d9e503680d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,94,251,246,238,10,85,136,116,189,139,214,170,131,41,217,229,3,104,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
