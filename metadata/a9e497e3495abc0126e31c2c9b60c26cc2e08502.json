What were the factors that acceleratedÃ¢â‚¬â€or impededÃ¢â‚¬â€ development? How did the experiences of Old World inhabitants differ from their New World counterpartsÃ¢â‚¬â€and what factors influenced those differences?\n\nIn this fascinating and erudite history, Peter Watson ponders these questions central to the human story. By 15,000 BC, humans had migrated from northeastern Asia across the frozen Bering land bridge to the Americas. When the world warmed up and the last Ice Age came to an end, the Bering Strait refilled with water, dividing America from Eurasia. This divisionÃ¢â‚¬â€with two great populations on Earth, each unaware of the otherÃ¢â‚¬â€continued until Christopher Columbus voyaged to the New World in the fifteenth century.\n\nThe Great Divide compares the development of humankind in the Old World and the New between 15,000 BC and AD 1500. Watson identifies three major differences between the two worldsÃ¢â‚¬â€climate, domesticable mammals, and hallucinogenic plantsÃ¢â‚¬â€that combined to produce very different trajectories of civilization in the two hemispheres. Combining the most up-to-date knowledge in archaeology, anthropology, geology, meteorology, cosmology, and mythology, this unprecedented, masterful study offers uniquely revealing insight into what it means to be human.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9e497e3495abc0126e31c2c9b60c26cc2e08502","amp;dn":"The+Great+Divide+-+Nature+and+the+Human+nature+-+Peter+Watson+%5Be","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9e497e3495abc0126e31c2c9b60c26cc2e08502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,228,151,227,73,90,188,1,38,227,28,44,155,96,194,108,194,224,133,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
