When it came out it was considered (melodic) Thrash Metal. Anyways, this is a fantastic debut with not a weak track on the whole album and the group was hailed as the next new big thrash sensation. The songs are excellent and with great high pitched vocal from the singer. This was Jason Newstedts (ex-Metallica) first group, and this, Flotsam &amp; Jetsams debut, was the only release he appeared on before joining Metallica. Also, Jason was the one writing almost all the song on this album all by himself, both the music and the lyrics. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=1929&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=1929&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPrevious uploads -  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pentry1973&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pentry1973&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAnd as always, help me seed this and other uploads you download from me.....\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:282afc063d4ce1edf19f8062c8f2206f6ab8ae13","amp;dn":"Thrash+Metal+%2F%2F+FLOTSAM+AND+JETSAM+-+Doomsday+for+the+Deceiver+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"282afc063d4ce1edf19f8062c8f2206f6ab8ae13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,42,252,6,61,76,225,237,241,159,128,98,200,242,32,111,106,184,174,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
