Another excellent read.\n\n&quot;Unintended Consequences is a novel by author John Ross, first published in 1996 by Accurate Press. The lengthy (863 pages) story chronicles the history of the gun culture, gun rights and gun control in the United States from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. The story is heavily laced with accurate historical information, including real-life figures who play minor supporting roles. The novel also features unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of many firearms-related topics. &quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a496f3e31a323fe7fc43bc0d07f49a9227c8f1b","amp;dn":"Unintended+Consequences-+John+Ross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a496f3e31a323fe7fc43bc0d07f49a9227c8f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,73,111,62,49,163,35,254,127,196,59,192,208,127,73,169,34,124,143,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
