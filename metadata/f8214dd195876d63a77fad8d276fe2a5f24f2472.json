The authors employ a conversational writing style that is instructive and interesting to read.  Jones and Fleming take the time to not only explain the basics but also coach students through the tough parts of the subject. They do this by pointing out common mistakes that students make and providing expert advice on solving problems.  Whether a student reads the book from beginning to end, or uses the text as a reference, the authors have developed innovative pedagogy to meet their needs, and an art and media program to help students visualize each process.[/color]\n\n[color=Red]About the Author[/color]\n[color=Blue]Maitland Jones, Jr. is Professor of Chemistry at New York University. His undergraduate and graduate degrees are from Yale University. A long-time teacher of the organic chemistry course at Princeton, he is also an internationally recognized research scientist. His field of expertise is reactive intermediates, extremely short-lived molecules that exist only momentarily in the course of a chemical reaction. Within that subfield, Professor Jones is particularly interested in carbenes, carbon atoms with only two of their bond-forming electrons linked to other atoms, instead of the usual four. He is considered one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading authorities on this subject and travels widely, lecturing on his research.
