The \ntwo CDs in this collection include all her Satie \nefforts.  They were recorded around 1990 with\nsuperb sound quality, no remastering needed.\nTrack listings are included. \n\nI saw one reviewer at Amazon complain that she has a \n19th century, romantic sensibility inappropriate for \nSatie the modernist.  I hear Satie's minimalist quirkiness \ncoming through just fine.   This could be your favorite\nSatie pianist, give it try.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e65f61d365eea7255d655bebec102e47add061e","amp;dn":"Erik+Satie+-+Anne+Queff%26eacute%3Blec+collection+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e65f61d365eea7255d655bebec102e47add061e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,101,246,29,54,94,234,114,85,214,85,190,190,193,2,228,122,221,6,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
