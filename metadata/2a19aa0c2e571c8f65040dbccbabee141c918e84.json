The arrangements have more of a dreamlike lean than the more Appalachian approach of their earlier work, but ultimately the music serves the songs and vocal performances on Scheherazade, and does so beautifully. \r\n\r\nScheherazade isn't exactly the Feel Good Album of 2016, but being lost and forsaken with Freakwater is a more satisfying experience than feeling perky with most other acts, and Scheherazade is a brilliant reminder of what Catherine Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean do so strikingly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
