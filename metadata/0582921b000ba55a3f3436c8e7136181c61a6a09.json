Vol. XIX of Kierkegaard's Writings, edited and translated, with introduction and notes, by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong. Princeton University Press, 1980.\n\nISBN 9780691020280 | 256 pages | PDF\n\nA companion piece to The Concept of Anxiety, this work continues SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard's radical and comprehensive analysis of human nature in a spectrum of possibilities of existence. Present here is a remarkable combination of the insight of the poet and the contemplation of the philosopher.\n\nIn The Sickness unto Death, Kierkegaard moves beyond anxiety on the mental-emotional level to the spiritual level, where -- in contact with the eternal -- anxiety becomes despair. Both anxiety and despair reflect the misrelation that arises in the self when the elements of the synthesis -- the infinite and the finite -- do not come into proper relation to each other. Despair is a deeper expression for anxiety and is a mark of the eternal, which is intended to penetrate temporal existence.\n\nKierkegaard's Writings is a definitive, systematically translated, scholarly edition of SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard's works in English, comprising twenty-five volumes of text and a separate cumulative index. Each volume includes a historical introduction, selections from Kierkegaard's journals and provisional manuscripts, notes and an index.\n\nReview\n\n&quot;The definitive edition of the Writings. The first volume . . . indicates the scholarly value of the entire series: an introduction setting the work in the context of Kierkegaard's development; a remarkably clear translation; and concluding sections of intelligent notes.&quot; -- Library Journal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0582921b000ba55a3f3436c8e7136181c61a6a09","amp;dn":"Kierkegaard%3A+The+Sickness+unto+Death+%28Princeton%2C+1980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0582921b000ba55a3f3436c8e7136181c61a6a09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,130,146,27,0,11,165,90,63,52,54,200,231,19,97,129,198,26,106,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
