The 2,000-year-old object, no bigger than a modern laptop, is now regarded as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest computer, devised to predict solar eclipses and, according to recent findings, calculate the timing of the ancient Olympics. Following the efforts of an international team of scientists, the mysteries of the Antikythera Mechanism are uncovered, revealing surprising and awe-inspiring details of the object that continues to mystify.\n\nVideo : x264 @ 3500 Kbps\nDuration : 58mn 41s\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeigh : 720 pixels\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nAudio : English AAC 2.0 @ 160 Kbps\nSubtitles : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34d94e48813bd71d84c0c7ac63e88b4579b7395","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Two+Thousand+Year+Old+Computer+2012+720p+HDTV+x264+AAC-M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c34d94e48813bd71d84c0c7ac63e88b4579b7395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,77,148,228,136,19,189,113,216,76,12,122,198,62,136,180,87,155,115,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
