Why?\n\nOn his journey through the ages, Professor Cox explores the role that international competition played in getting man to the Moon and asks if, with America no longer the world's only superpower, we are at the dawn of a bright new space age.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbbc8472669f5303e45523876e9cc812d56f8d92","amp;dn":"Guide+to+the+Moon+with+Brian+Cox++%28BBC+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbbc8472669f5303e45523876e9cc812d56f8d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,188,132,114,102,159,83,3,228,85,35,135,110,156,200,18,213,111,141,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
