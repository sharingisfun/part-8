Power Windows was the first Rush album to be produced by Peter Collins and the album was recorded at The Manor in England, AIR Studios in Montserrat and at Sarm East Studios in London.\n\nPower Windows introduced more keyboard synthesizers into the band's sound. &quot;The Big Money&quot; and &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot; were both made into music videos featured in MTV's rotation at the time. This was the era in which the band were moving away from progressive rock and &quot;tightened up their sidelong suites and rhythmic abstractions into balled-up song fists, art-pop blasts of angular, slashing guitar, spatial keyboards and hyperpercussion, all resolved with forthright melodic sense&quot;. \n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;The Big Money&quot;   \t5:37\n2. \t&quot;Grand Designs&quot;   \t5:06\n3. \t&quot;Manhattan Project&quot;   \t5:07\n4. \t&quot;Marathon&quot;   \t6:09\n5. \t&quot;Territories&quot;   \t6:20\n6. \t&quot;Middletown Dreams&quot;   \t5:15\n7. \t&quot;Emotion Detector&quot;   \t5:11\n8. \t&quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;   \t5:54\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1299d978261cdcfa10864584d8f64161fead2f99","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Power+Windows+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1299d978261cdcfa10864584d8f64161fead2f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,153,217,120,38,28,220,250,16,134,69,132,216,246,65,97,254,173,47,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
