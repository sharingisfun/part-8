Follow the paths of several distinct factions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each with their own questionable methods and uncertain motivations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as unforeseen consequences intersect and reality once again slips back into a brilliant haze of neon and bloodshed.\n\nBlistering combat against punishing opposition will require intense focus as new variables, weapons, and methods of execution are introduced throughout the struggle. Let the striking colors of an unmistakable visual style wash over as you meticulously cut down those that would stand between you and the ultimate meaning behind the massacre. This is the finale, this is the unquestionable end.\n\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Relentless Hostilities: Adjust combat techniques as the narrative shifts between factions and brings unique variations to a familiar approach along with new weapons, movements, and melee attacks.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Enthralling Soundtrack: Over forty pounding tracks from dozens of artists punctuate the savage conflict and bring the larger scale of your actions into focus. New artists join returning favorites like M|O|O|N, Perturbator, Jasper Byrne, Scattle, and El Huervo for an incredible audio massacre.\n\nÃ¢â€”ï¿½Custom Level Editor: Design custom levels using characters, enemies, weapons and music tracks from the game and share your creations with others.
