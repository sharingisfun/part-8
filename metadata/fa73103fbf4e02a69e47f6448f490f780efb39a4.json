The new series pits the cream of KordaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carping talent against some of the most pressured carp in the country and those ingredients combine to give us some of the most compelling carp TV ever filmed. The nine shows contain some unbelievable hauling, and the personalities involved include Simon Scott, Darrell Peck, Adam Penning, Gaz Fareham, Ali Hamidi, Danny Fairbrass and Jake Wildbore. Venues also covered include Walthamstow, Manor Farm, Farlows, Sandhurst, The Blue Pool and Yateley Pads Lake. As usual, all the tactics that the lads used to bank a succession of whackers are faithfully recorded and presented for all to see.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa73103fbf4e02a69e47f6448f490f780efb39a4","amp;dn":"Korda+Thinking+Tackle+Season+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa73103fbf4e02a69e47f6448f490f780efb39a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,115,16,63,191,78,2,166,158,71,246,68,143,73,15,120,14,251,57,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
