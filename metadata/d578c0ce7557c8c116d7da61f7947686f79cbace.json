Surrounded by men who are jockeying for power - Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony - young Octavius must work against the powerful Roman political machinations to claim his destiny as first Roman emperor.\n\nSprung from meticulous research and the pen of a true poet, Augustus tells the story of one man's dream to liberate a corrupt Rome from the fancy of the capriciously crooked and the wildly wealthy.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d578c0ce7557c8c116d7da61f7947686f79cbace","amp;dn":"Augustus+-+John+Williams+%282011+-+Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d578c0ce7557c8c116d7da61f7947686f79cbace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,120,192,206,117,87,200,193,22,215,218,97,247,148,118,134,247,156,186,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
