An executive accused of embezzling kills himself and his loved ones. A house fire claims the lives of all its inhabitants. Separate incidents with two common threadsÃ¢â‚¬â€a first wife who took her own life, and a secret the victims took to their graves.\n\nStephanie Coburn has barely recovered from her sister's mysterious suicide before her brother-in-law and his new wife are murdered, her face disfigured beyond recognition. Stephanie never met the bride, has never even seen a clear photograph. But she knew her sister, and she knows something is desperately wrong.\n\nThe police won't listen. Her only ally is another victim's son. Step by step, they're uncovering a trail of brutal vengeance and a killer who will never relentÃ¢â‚¬â€and whose forgiveness can only be earned in death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479ad4c708decf188eb1f98ce9ba78c78cbc747c","amp;dn":"Kevin+O%27Brien+-+Tell+Me+You%27re+Sorry+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479ad4c708decf188eb1f98ce9ba78c78cbc747c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,154,212,199,8,222,207,24,142,177,249,140,233,186,120,199,140,188,116,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
