It was the BBC&amp;#039;s most ambitious and controversial venture into &quot;telefantasy&quot;, with the verdicts of the critics ranging all the way from a minor masterpiece to a dreadful folly. It overreached itself and the projected third season was cancelled, but the first two books of John Christopher&amp;#039;s celebrated trilogy were completely dramatised, and there&amp;#039;s much to value: fine scripting, lavish costume and design, ground-breaking model work and video editing, beautifully composed landscape filming, good acting and painstaking care over details.\n\nTech Info\n=========\n\nVideo Track #1:\nFOURCC: &quot;DIVX&quot; (DivXÃ‚Â® Video)\n640x480, 25,000000 fps\n\nAudio Track #1:\nFormatTag : &quot;85&quot; (MPEG-1 Layer-3 Audio (mp3))\n2 channels, 48000Hz\nLanguage: N/A\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564d73efd1b9b794aec6bd3d483f436b92fca6a0","amp;dn":"The+Tripods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564d73efd1b9b794aec6bd3d483f436b92fca6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,77,115,239,209,185,183,148,174,198,189,61,72,63,67,107,146,252,166,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
