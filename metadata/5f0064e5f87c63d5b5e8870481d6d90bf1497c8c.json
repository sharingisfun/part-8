From an isolationist nation at the end of World War One, the US today has bases in over ninety countries. No other nation has been able to project military power as the US does today. But is such an involvement sustainable? Despite its might, the US is shrinking in terms of population and economic power in relation to the rest of the world. So, what would happen should the United States leave the international scene, and become again a &quot;normal nation&quot;, a republic, and not an empire? To find an answer to this question, director and producer Mitch Anderson embarked on an investigative trip on four continents. &quot;The World Without US&quot; is an in-depth investigation of how US foreign policy affects the lives of millions of people around the world.\nFuture scenarios in the absence of the US intervention are well debated and substantiated by experts and ordinary citizens whose lives have been affected by the American presence in different regions. The film's main expert is Niall Ferguson PHD. Niall is very well reputed in the documentary world, he has co-authored many docs at BBC and Chanel4 in the UK and he's the author of several volumes on world history. He contributes on regular basis on a number of Current Events magazines in the US and Europe.\n\n&quot;The World Without US&quot; is conclusive, politically charged and opinionated, making for good drama while staying true to the facts and journalistic integrity.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/1208/theworldwithouttheusscr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/1208/theworldwithouttheusscr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/8474/theworldwithouttheusscrz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/8474/theworldwithouttheusscrz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7751/theworldwithouttheusscrso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7751/theworldwithouttheusscrso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7731/theworldwithouttheusscrk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7731/theworldwithouttheusscrk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/5104/theworldwithouttheusscrw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/5104/theworldwithouttheusscrw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7827/theworldwithouttheusscrp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/7827/theworldwithouttheusscrp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9365/theworldwithouttheusscrn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/9365/theworldwithouttheusscrn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/5779/theworldwithouttheusscrxc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/5779/theworldwithouttheusscrxc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/6519/theworldwithouttheusscrd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/6519/theworldwithouttheusscrd.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/1442/theworldwithouttheusscri.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img862.imageshack.us/img862/1442/theworldwithouttheusscri.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/7731/theworldwithouttheusscrk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/7731/theworldwithouttheusscrk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/9415/theworldwithouttheusscru.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/9415/theworldwithouttheusscru.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1183 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25fps\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2ch\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime per Part 83.mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 827 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theworldwithoutus.com/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theworldwithoutus.com/index.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0064e5f87c63d5b5e8870481d6d90bf1497c8c","amp;dn":"The+World+Without+The+U+S+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0064e5f87c63d5b5e8870481d6d90bf1497c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,0,100,229,248,124,99,213,181,232,135,4,129,214,217,11,241,73,124,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
