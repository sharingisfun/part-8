Together the three books offer an introduction to the workings of architecture providing for the three aspects of learning: theory, examples and practice. Twenty-Five Buildings focusses on analysing examples using the methodology offered by Analysing Architecture, which operates primarily through the medium of drawing.\n\nIn this second edition five further buildings have been added to the original twenty from an even wider geographical area, which now includes the USA, France, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, Finland, Germany, Australia, Norway, Sweden, India and Japan.\n\nThe underlying theme of Twenty-Five Buildings Every Architect Should Understand is the relationship of architecture to the human being, how it frames our lives and orchestrates our experiences; how it can help us make sense of the world and contribute to our senses of identity and place. Exploring these dimensions through a wide range of case studies that illustrate the rich diversity of twentieth and twenty-first century architecture, this book is essential reading for every architect","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18af1026156ff8b51379d08d685d7d631387c7e4","amp;dn":"Twenty-Five+Buildings+Every+Architect+Should+Understand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18af1026156ff8b51379d08d685d7d631387c7e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,175,16,38,21,111,248,181,19,121,208,141,104,93,125,99,19,135,199,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
