Satterfield believes in making the most out of the entire plant, much as his contemporaries April Bloomfield and Fergus Henderson use the whole animal, from nose to tail, in their dishes. As executive chef of Miller Union, Satterfield embodies an authentic approach to farmstead-inspired cooking, by which braising, pickling, preserving, and canning are often incorporated into everyday cuisine. His trademark is simple food, and in his creative hands he continually updates the region's legendary dishes to produce easy yet sublime fare that can be made in the home kitchen.\n\nRoot to Leaf is not a vegetarian cookbookÃ¢â‚¬â€it's a cookbook that celebrates vegetables. Everyone, from the omnivore to the vegan, will find something here. Organized by seasons, and with a decidedly Southern flair, Satterfield's collection of mouthwatering recipes makes the most of available produce from local markets, foraging, and the home garden. A must-have for the home cook, this beautifully designed book, with its stunning color photographs, elevates the bounty of the vegetable kingdom as never before.\n\n\nEPUB,Retail: 496 pages\nPublisher: HarperWave (March 3, 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0062283693\nISBN-13: 978-0062283696","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c951577721e6e265da91f027a42922186be096bb","amp;dn":"Root+to+Leaf+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c951577721e6e265da91f027a42922186be096bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,81,87,119,33,230,226,101,218,145,240,39,164,41,34,24,107,224,150,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
