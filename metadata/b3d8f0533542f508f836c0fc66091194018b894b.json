Any one of the stories could be their own little movies. The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with &quot;666&quot; for the combination. You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.\n\n  Starring: John Travolta, Samuel L.
