Released on November 3, 1992 through Mercury Records. It was also Bon Jovi's first album since 1986's Slippery When Wet not to be produced by Bruce Fairbairn. The album was produced by Bob Rock and was recorded at the Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, Canada. Keep the Faith represents the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Bon Jovi, marking a change of both the band's image and sound. Moving away from their early hair metal roots in previous albums, it introduced a more &quot;rock n roll&quot; driven groove to Bon Jovi's sound. The album turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, but instead introduced a new sound of Bon Jovi which consisted of piano ballads and long epic guitar solos. It also has the longest run time of any Bon Jovi album so far released and the last to feature bassist Alec John Such, before his retirement in 1994.\n\nKeep The Faith peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 chart while topping the charts in the UK and Australia. The album certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record produced several hits for the band, including &quot;Keep The Faith&quot;, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; and &quot;In These Arms&quot;.\n\nThe album was ranked No. 21 on Kerrang!s &quot;100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and in 2006, the album featured in the Classic Rock &amp; Metal Hammer's The &quot;200 Greatest Albums Of The 90's&quot;\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n\nCD (1)\nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;I Believe&quot;   \t                                  5:50\n2. \t&quot;Keep the Faith&quot;   \t\t                  5:45\n3. \t&quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot;   \t\t          4:43\n4. \t&quot;In These Arms&quot;   \t\t                  5:19\n5. \t&quot;Bed of Roses&quot;   \t \t                  6:34\n6. \t&quot;If I Was Your Mother&quot;   \t \t          4:26\n7. \t&quot;Dry County&quot;   \t                                  9:53\n8. \t&quot;Woman in Love&quot;   \t \t                  3:48\n9. \t&quot;Fear&quot;   \t\t                          3:05\n10. \t&quot;I Want You&quot;   \t                                  5:36\n11. \t&quot;Blame It on the Love of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;   \t  4:23\n12. \t&quot;Little Bit of Soul&quot;    \t                  5:47\n13. \t&quot;Save a Prayer (Bonus Track in Japan and Europe)&quot; 5:57\n\nCD (2)\nNo.\n1. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;Live in the Count Basie Theater,Red Bank,NewJersey, 1992&quot;   \t \n2.&quot;In These Arms&quot;Live in the Count Basie Theater, Red Bank,NewJersey, 1992&quot;   \t \n3.&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;Live in the Count Basie Theater, Red Bank,NewJersey, 1992&quot;   \t \n4.&quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;Live in Lakeland, Florida, 1989&quot;   \t \n5.&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;Live in Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, 1989&quot;   \t \n6.&quot;Bad Medicine&quot;Live in the Miami Arena, Florida, 1993&quot;   \t \n7.&quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (acoustic)Live in the Miami Arena, Florida, 1993&quot;   \t \n8.&quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; (acoustic)Live in the Miami Arena, Florida, 1993&quot;  \n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7920a819ced628cfc6bba90492f2ee3708bcf2ba","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+1992+-+Keep+The+Faith+%282CD%29+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7920a819ced628cfc6bba90492f2ee3708bcf2ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,32,168,25,206,214,40,207,198,187,169,4,146,242,238,55,8,188,242,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
