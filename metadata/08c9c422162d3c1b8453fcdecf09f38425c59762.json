But no way is he ready for the alien presence that is about to invade his mind, or for the winds of chaos set to blow through his life.\r\n\r\nIt is humanity's first contact with an alien presence--and Bandicut can tell no one about the disembodied quarx that has taken up residence in his mind. The quarx, part of an eons-old interstellar civilization that uses advanced chaos theory to predict catastrophic events, seeks to prevent a cometary collision that threatens the Earth. But it must have help--and Bandicut must trust the alien, knowing that humanity's very existence may be at stake. He must break all the rules, and sacrifice everything he holds dear, to prevent a cataclysm that would destroy an unsuspecting humanity.\r\n\r\nLeaving friends and lover behind, hurtling across the solar system in a stolen spaceship, Bandicut can only hope that his desperate actions will save the Earth--even if he doesn't live to see it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by David Hilder\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 48 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08c9c422162d3c1b8453fcdecf09f38425c59762","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+A.+Carver+-+Neptune+Crossing+%28Chaos+Chronicles+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08c9c422162d3c1b8453fcdecf09f38425c59762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,201,196,34,22,45,60,27,132,83,252,222,207,9,243,132,37,197,151,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
