We ask questions when we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand. Yet, the Creator of the universe who spoke all that we see into being asks questions. Unimaginable power and wisdom are already His. As strange as it may seem to us, the Bible is filled with questions God asks. He is not the one who needs answers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ these questions help us to understand both God and ourselves.\n\n- Delve into the answers found by Job, Adam, Cain, Moses, Joshua, Elijah, and others\n- Examine our fundamental assumptions about God, human nature, relationships, origins, and purpose\n- Learn about godly character and GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transforming message\n\nFind a powerful supplement for family worship, Bible study, and personal devotions in the Questions God Asks. Stop demanding answers from God and begin answering the questions He asks of us.\n\nAbout the author:\nIsrael Wayne is an author and conference speaker who has a passion for defending the Christian faith and promoting a Biblical worldview.
