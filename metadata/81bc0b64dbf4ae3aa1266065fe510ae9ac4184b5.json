A series of bloody, tragic and impossible crimes would suggest someone is carrying out copycat Jack the Ripper murders. The murders are investigated by our three unlikely heroes: Chandler, a fast-tracked, media savvy DI on his first big murder case; Miles, nearing retirement, a front-line, hard-bitten DS, and Buchan, the eccentrically brilliant Jack the Ripper tour guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81bc0b64dbf4ae3aa1266065fe510ae9ac4184b5","amp;dn":"Whitechapel.Season.3.480p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81bc0b64dbf4ae3aa1266065fe510ae9ac4184b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,188,11,100,219,244,174,58,161,38,96,101,254,81,10,233,172,65,132,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
