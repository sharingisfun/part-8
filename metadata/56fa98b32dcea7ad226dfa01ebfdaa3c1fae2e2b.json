When the sorcerer Merlin has visions of a dark future, he installs the young and impetuous Arthur, UtherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unknown son and heir, who has been raised from birth as a commoner. But ArthurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cold and ambitious half sister Morgan will fight him to the bitter end, summoning unnatural forces to claim the crown in this epic battle for control. These are dark times indeed for the new king, with Guinevere being the only shining light in ArthurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harsh world. Faced with profound moral decisions, and the challenge of uniting a kingdom broken by war and steeped in deception, Arthur will be tested beyond imagination. Forget everything you think you knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦this is the story of Camelot that has never been told before.\n\n\n\ne01&gt;&gt;&quot;Homecoming&quot;\tCiaran Donnelly\tStory by: Michael Hirst &amp; Chris Chibnall\nTeleplay by: Chris Chibnall\tFebruary 25, 2011\n\n\ne02&gt;&gt;&quot;The Sword and the Crown&quot;\tCiaran Donnelly\tChris Chibnall\tApril 1, 2011\n\n\ne03&gt;&gt;&quot;Guinevere&quot;\tJeremy Podeswa\tStory by: Chris Chibnall &amp; Louise Fox\nTeleplay by: Louise Fox\tApril 8, 2011\n\n\ne04&gt;&gt;&quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;\tJeremy Podeswa\tLouise Fox &amp; Chris Chibnall\tApril 15, 2011\t\n\n\ne05&gt;&gt;&quot;Justice&quot;\tStefan Schwartz\tSarah Phelps &amp; Terry Cafolla\tApril 29, 2011\n\n\ne06&gt;&gt;&quot;Three Journeys&quot;\tStefan Schwartz\tChris Chibnall\tMay 6, 2011\n\n\ne07&gt;&gt;&quot;The Long Night&quot;\tMikael Salomon\tSteven Lightfoot\tMay 13, 2011\n\n\ne08&gt;&gt;&quot;Igraine&quot;\tMichelle MacLaren\tStory by: Chris Chibnall &amp; Louise Fox\nTeleplay by: Chris Chibnall &amp; Steven Lightfoot\tMay 20, 2011\n\n\ne09&gt;&gt;&quot;The Battle of Bardon Pass&quot; (Part 1)\tMikael Salomon\tLouise Fox &amp; Chris Chibnall\tJune 3, 2011\n\n\ne10&gt;&gt;&quot;Reckoning&quot; (Part 2)\tMikael Salomon &amp; Stefan Schwartz\tTerry Cafolla &amp; Chris Chibnall\tJune 10, 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56fa98b32dcea7ad226dfa01ebfdaa3c1fae2e2b","amp;dn":"Camelot+2011+S01+Complete+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56fa98b32dcea7ad226dfa01ebfdaa3c1fae2e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,250,152,179,45,206,167,173,34,109,250,1,235,253,170,60,31,174,46,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
