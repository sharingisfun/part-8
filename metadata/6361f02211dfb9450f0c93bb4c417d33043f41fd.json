Lansdale REUNITES with his Jonah Hex collaborator, ARTIST Timothy Truman, to tell the grittiest, roughest, downright meanest Conan story ever seen in COMICS.\n\nThis five-part SERIES begins in the wretched wastes of Stygia, a burning, grinding stretch of desert so desolate the only thing more unforgiving are its inhabitants. There, Conan comes to the aid of an old ally, uncovers a scheme to acquire untold-of wealth, and punishes his foolish enemies most cruelly. Yet when his treasure hunt reveals an alluring spirit with long unsatisfied needs, the Cimmerian knows a gentler touch is required to win the day.\n\nTeaming the wild, scathing wit of Lansdale with the unflinching vision of Truman, Conan and the Songs of the Dead is an unprecedented take on the GRAND hero of sword-and-sorcery-pushing one of the most brutal heroes of literature to new extremes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6361f02211dfb9450f0c93bb4c417d33043f41fd","amp;dn":"Conan+and+the+Songs+of+the+Dead+%2801+-+05%29+%282006%29+%28digital%29+%28Minu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6361f02211dfb9450f0c93bb4c417d33043f41fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,97,240,34,17,223,185,69,15,12,147,187,76,65,125,51,4,63,65,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
