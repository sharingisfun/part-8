Rush also recorded parts of their first album at the same studio. Since the first album sessions the studio had upgraded its equipment from a Cadac console with an Ampex MM-1000 2 inch 16 track and a MM-1000 8 track to a two-inch analog 24-track master tape recorder. Pictures shown on the album artwork indicate that the studio used a 24-track recorder made by Studer and a Neve mixing console, a combination that was widely considered to be state of the art by audio engineers. These were the preferred brands by many top studios worldwide up through the mid-1990s when digital recording equipment became the standard. Fly by Night is the band's first album to be produced by Terry Brown, who had remixed the band's debut album. Brown would maintain this role through 1982's Signals. \n\n The high fidelity recording of Fly by Night was very positive in moving the band forward in a direction that piqued the interest of audiophiles who would seek out this type of recording while also getting familiar with the band's material. It set an early standard of excellence in this area not often prioritized by the harder rock bands of the mid-1970s rock era.\n\n\n Prior to one of Rush's first U.S. tours, original drummer John Rutsey split from the band, since he wasn't prepared to commit to the band's rigorous touring schedule. And it proved to be a blessing in disguise, since his replacement was to become one of the most respected rock drummers of all time, Neil Peart, who would also steer the band towards success with more challenging material -- starting with Fly by Night. While the title track and the album-closing ballad, &quot;In the End,&quot; still had Zeppelin roots, the album isn't as straightforward as the debut. Rush's first bona-fide classic, &quot;Anthem,&quot; is included, while the over eight-minute &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; helped pave the way for the group's future epics (&quot;2112,&quot; &quot;Cygnus X-1,&quot; etc.), and introduced the fans to Peart's imaginative lyric writing, often tinged with science-fiction themes. The reflective and melodic &quot;Making Memories&quot; is an underrated early composition, while &quot;Beneath, Between, &amp; Behind&quot; is a furious heavy rocker. Fly by Night may not be one of Rush's finest albums, but it is one of their most important -- it showed that the young band was leaving their Zep-isms behind in favor of a more challenging and original direction.
