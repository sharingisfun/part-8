The first single from the album, &quot;Get On Your Boots&quot;, may be an all-out rocker akin to previous successes like &quot;Vertigo&quot;, but the remainder of the album sees the band diversifying in ways similar to their Zooropa days. It is inescapably a U2 album, though, so Bono's vocals still speak of injustices personal and global, and The Edge's guitar work continues to be both feathery and metallic in equal dose. As far as continuing the band's lengthy career goes, No Line On The Horizon is simultaneously a crowd-pleaser and musical step forward. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbca379d4260771cae497a39216eb1bfc2ce4473","amp;dn":"U2+-+No+Line+On+The+Horizon+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbca379d4260771cae497a39216eb1bfc2ce4473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,202,55,157,66,96,119,28,174,73,122,57,33,110,177,191,194,206,68,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
