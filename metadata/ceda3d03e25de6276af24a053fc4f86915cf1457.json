Benjamin\n48 Lectures\n\n\nSo much of our historical knowledge is rooted in Western civilization, from the stories of ancient Greece and Rome to the intellectual developments of the Renaissance. But this history tells only part of the story of our global world. Eastern civilization has its own fascinating story, with consequences that matter deeply to our lives today.\n\nHow did Eastern civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly that of China, Korea, Japan, and the nations of Southeast AsiaÃ¢â‚¬â€develop? What do we know about the history, politics, governments, art, science, and technology of these countries? And how does the story of Eastern civilization play out in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world of business, politics, and international exchange?\n\nFoundations of Eastern Civilization takes you on a grand journey to explore the big accomplishments of Eastern civilization, from the material economy of day to day life to the political and religious philosophies that would bind these cultures together for thousands of years. Over the course of 48 ambitious lectures, Professor Craig G. Benjamin of Grand Valley State University introduces you to the many people, achievements, and ideas that came out of Eastern civilization and played a role in creating the modern world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceda3d03e25de6276af24a053fc4f86915cf1457","amp;dn":"TTC+Video+-+Foundations+of+Eastern+Civilization","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceda3d03e25de6276af24a053fc4f86915cf1457","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,218,61,3,226,93,230,39,106,242,74,5,63,196,248,105,21,207,20,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
