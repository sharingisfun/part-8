The first five chapters deal with the structure of organic compounds and discuss important organic chemistry bonds, fundamental principles of conformation, and stereochemistry of organic molecules, and reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. Chapters 6 to 9 are concerned with general principles of mechanism in organic chemistry, including acids and bases, photochemistry, sonochemistry and microwave irradiation, and finally the relationship between structure and reactivity. The last 10 chapters cover the nature and the scope of organic reactions and their mechanisms.\n\nThe 7th edition proves again it is a must-have desktop reference and textbook for every student and professional working in organic chemistry or related fields.\n\nKey features of the 7th edition:\n\n    Every chapter has been updated with the most recent reaction information with references to both the primary and review literature\n    New to the 7th edition: 5,500 references since the last edition, updates / rewrites of the retained sections, and an updated index in Appendix B\n    Contains more than 1650 reactions and 20,000 valuable references to the primary literature\n    Includes appendices on the literature of organic chemistry and the classification of reactions according to the compounds synthesized\n    Guides the reader on planning and execution of multi-step synthetic reactions, with detailed descriptions of all the reactions. \n\nReviews of the previous edition:\n\n&quot;...a favorite general organic chemistry text and an easy-to-use one-volume reference. We are confident that this book will remain a dominant reference and that it will reside on many chemists' personal bookshelves.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œJournal of Medicinal Chemistry\n\n&quot;Who can hope to be seriously accepted as a member of the organic chemistry community without being in possession of at least one edition of 'March'?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œChemistry and Industry\n\nPublisher: Wiley; 7 edition (April 22, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470462590\nISBN-13: 978-0470462591\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;In conclusion, this latest, mammoth edition of March/Smith is highly recommended.&quot;  (Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 1 June 2013)\n\n \n\n \nFrom the Back Cover\n\nSeventh Edition integrates advances in organic chemistry and reactions into acclaimed text\n\n&quot;Who can hope to be seriously accepted as a member of the organic chemistry community without being in possession of at least one edition of March?&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Chemistry &amp; Industry, from a review of the Sixth Edition\n\nNow in its seventh edition, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry remains the gold standard in organic chemistry, setting the foundation for organic chemistry theory and practice. Throughout its many editions, readers have relied on its clear, carefully written descriptions of reactions, mechanisms, and structure to plan and execute multi-step synthetic reactions. Offering a comprehensive treatment of organic chemistry, the text explores:\n\n    Structure of organic compounds, explaining important organic chemistry bonds, fundamental principles of conformation, stereochemistry of organic molecules, and reactive intermediates\n    Principles of mechanisms in organic chemistry, including acids and bases, photochemistry, sonochemistry, microwave irradiation, and the relationship between structure and reactivity\n    Nature, scope, and mechanisms of individual organic reactions\n\nThis Seventh Edition updates the text to reflect the most recent advances in organic chemistry and organic reactions. More than 5,500 references have been added to guide students to the latest primary, secondary, and review literature. In addition, there's a literature guide to help readers conduct thorough searches of any topic in organic chemistry.\n\nWith detailed descriptions of organic reactions to guide students through all the stages of planning and performing multi-step synthetic reactions, March's continues to be the textbook of choice for organic chemistry instructors and students around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4302d736ab592ac5f9f1601f109e1340167a793b","amp;dn":"%5BMichael+B.+Smith%5DMarch%27s+Advanced+Organic+Chemistry+Reactions%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4302d736ab592ac5f9f1601f109e1340167a793b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,2,215,54,171,89,42,197,249,241,96,31,16,158,19,64,22,122,121,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
