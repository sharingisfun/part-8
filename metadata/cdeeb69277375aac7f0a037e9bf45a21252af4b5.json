It's a special group that can deliver expressive vocals and tasty\n\npiano accompaniment at the same time.  Diana Krall, Ray Charles and not that many \n\nothers are on the short list.  Certainly many pop artists do this but their\n\npiano playing is generally less sophisticated both rhythmically and harmonically.\n\n\nGuitar bass is used here.  It allows unusually long sustain.  Horn is a master\n\nof musical silence.\n\n\nGuest musicians include Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis, Branford Marsalis and \n\nToots Thielemans.  Their participation attests to Shirley Horn's status\n\nin the jazz music world.
