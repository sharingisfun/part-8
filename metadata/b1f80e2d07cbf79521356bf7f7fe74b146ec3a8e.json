It presents a philosophy of war for managing conflicts and winning battles. Contrary to popular belief, it contains not only the writings of the original author, but also commentary and clarifications from later military philosophers, such as Li Quan and Du Mu. It is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and often referenced by generals and theorists throughout history.\n\nThe few Europeans who have yet had an opportunity of acquainting themselves with Sun Tzu are not behindhand in their praise. In this connection, I may perhaps be excused for quoting from a letter from Lord Roberts, to whom the sheets of the present work were submitted previous to publication: &quot;Many of Sun Wu's maxims are perfectly applicable to the present day, and no. 11 [in Chapter VIII] is one that the people of this country would do well to take to heart.&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tsu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tsu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f80e2d07cbf79521356bf7f7fe74b146ec3a8e","amp;dn":"Sun+Tsu+-+The+Art+of+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f80e2d07cbf79521356bf7f7fe74b146ec3a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,248,14,45,7,203,247,149,33,53,107,247,247,254,116,177,70,236,58,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
