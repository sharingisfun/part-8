Joseph Pevney's bio-pic takes a somewhat whitewashed view of Chaney's career, but Cagney  is nothing short of riveting in the lead. The film begins as Chaney, the son of two deaf parents, is tasting success in vaudeville as a knockabout juggler, mime, and quick-change artist. Chaney  meets Cleva Creighton (Dorothy Malone) and hires her as his assistant. They fall in love and marry, but when Chaney  reveals his parents are deaf mutes, she recoils in revulsion. When she gives birth to a son, she refuses to look at him, thinking their child will also be deaf. Chaney proves her wrong, but Cleva reveals an underlying psychological affliction that grows in intensity as Chaney's vaudeville success increases. When Chaney  becomes a vaudeville star, Cleva walks out on both Chaney  and her son. Chaney's son is sent to a home, since after Cleva's departure, he hasn't the money to support him. To get his son back, he travels to Hollywood and takes every bit role available, using his gift for creative disguises to land several roles in one film. Chaney  becomes well respected for his talents and his popularity becomes greater, and he eventually becomes a superstar. Along the way, he meets Hazel Bennett (Jane Greer) and they fall in love and marry. But his happiness is shattered when Cleva comes back into his life and demands the return of her son. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050681/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050681/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEng subtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3527165/man-of-a-thousand-faces-en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3527165/man-of-a-thousand-faces-en&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\nJoseph Pevney\n\n\n\n        James Cagney\t ... \tLon Chaney\n\tDorothy Malone\t... \tCleva Creighton Chaney\n\tJane Greer\t... \tHazel Bennet Chaney\n\tMarjorie Rambeau... \tGert\n\n\nVideo\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 2mn\n      Bit rate : 1 053 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.500\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Standard : NTSC\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.127\n      Stream size : 924 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 0.0.09 (UTC 2003-03-25)\n   Audio\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 2h 2mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 112 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f7618c9ee9aa362fb705675f77f83a08eb1403","amp;dn":"Man+Of+A+Thousand+Faces+%281957%29++James+Cagney+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f7618c9ee9aa362fb705675f77f83a08eb1403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,247,97,140,158,233,170,54,47,183,5,103,95,119,248,58,8,235,20,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
