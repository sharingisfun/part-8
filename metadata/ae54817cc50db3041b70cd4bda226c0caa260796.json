She is also a classically trained pianist, and can play the guitar.\n\nKreviazuk's first album, Under These Rocks and Stones, was released in June 1997 to critical praise.[3][4] The album was certified double platinum by the CRIA for selling over 200,000 copies in the U.S., fueled mostly by the singles &quot;Surrounded&quot; and &quot;God Made Me&quot;. Three videos from the album receive modest play on the video channel MuchMusic and radio (&quot;God Made Me&quot;, &quot;Believer&quot; and &quot;Wayne&quot;), but it was a fourth, &quot;Surrounded&quot;, that became her first major Canadian airplay hit in 1997. That year, Kreviazuk received her first Juno Award nomination as Best New Artist. She also took part in the 1998 Lilith Fair music festival; &quot;Surrounded&quot; was included in the live compilation album from that year.\n\nIn 1999, Kreviazuk released her second album. Titled Colour Moving and Still, it featured tracks written with her new husband, Raine Maida, lead singer of Our Lady Peace. The lead single from the album &quot;Before You&quot; became a huge radio hit in Canada and she performed the single on the 2000 Juno Awards, where she won two awards for Best Adult/Pop Album and Best Female Artist. Kreviazuk released two more videos from the album, &quot;Dear Life&quot; and &quot;Far Away&quot;, as well as an additional radio release, &quot;Souls&quot;, which was also remixed and was released as a promo vinyl for the M1 &amp; Steve Fernandez Remix.\n\nHer third album, What If It All Means Something, was released in 2002. This album also featured multiple collaborations with Maida. The first single, &quot;In This Life&quot;, was a hit in Canada. Kreviazuk performed the song live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nKreviazuk announced via her blog in August 2005 that she was writing and recording her fourth album in her home studio, with Maida producing. The first single off the album, &quot;All I Can Do&quot;, was made available on her official website and MySpace page prior to the release of the album. On July 24 the album premiered on the Canadian music channel Much More Music along with a behind the scenes special. The album, Ghost Stories, was released August 29, 2006.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, she released her first compilation album, Since We Met: The Best of 1996-2006. On October 13, 2009, she released her fifth studio album, Plain Jane. She is featured on a song called &quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; by fellow Canadian recording artist Drake from his 2011 album Take Care. Her sixth album, entitled In This Life, was released on July 3, 2012. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Chantal Kreviazuk :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae54817cc50db3041b70cd4bda226c0caa260796","amp;dn":"Chantal+Kreviazuk+-+Discography+1996+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae54817cc50db3041b70cd4bda226c0caa260796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,84,129,124,197,13,179,4,27,112,205,75,218,34,108,12,170,38,7,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
