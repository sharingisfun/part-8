Fortunately, the twain do meet and the project even succeeds with creative flair in this compilation. It kicked off the Red Hot AIDS Benefit series back in 1990 and in fact launched its own sort of minigenre, including theme albums devoted to George Gershwin and Duke Ellington. In fact, this eclectic mix of Cole Porter covers interpreted by a wide swath of contemporary artists unfurls a pretty ambitious agenda in addition to its message of AIDS awareness and compassion. Here, the legacy of this ultra-sophisticated, closeted master of the popular song from the era of the &quot;lost generation&quot; is presented as a source of rejuvenating inspiration. Porter's craft seems validated by the very flexibility of the original songs as they get retrofitted to encompass styles ranging from U2 and Tom Waits to Jungle Brothers. There's an occasional miscalculation (Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop's didactic &quot;updating&quot; of Porter's bon vivant wit doesn't compare well with the original), but moments of stunning fusion abound (SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor and Annie Lenox contribute especially memorable gems). Instead of getting lost in translation, Red Hot + Blue adds a whole new dimension to the art of swellegance. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I've Got U Under My Skin\t\t- Neneh Cherry\n[02] In The Still Of The Night\t\t- Neville Brothers\n[03] You Do Something To Me\t\t\t- SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor\n[04] Begin The Beguine\t\t\t- Salif Keita\n[05] Love For Sale\t\t\t\t- Fine Young Cannibals\n[06] Well Did You Evah!\t\t\t- Deborah Harry &amp; Iggy Pop\n[07] Miss Otis Regrets/Just One Of Those.... \t- Kirsty MacColl Featuring The Pogues\n[08] Don't Fence Me In\t\t\t- David Byrne\n[09] It's All Right With Me\t\t\t- Tom Waits\n[10] Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\t\t- Annie Lennox\n[11] Night And Day\t\t\t\t- U2\n[12] I Love Paris\t\t\t\t- Les Negresses Vertes\n[13] So In Love\t\t\t\t- k.d. lang\n[14] Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\t\t- The Thompson Twins\n[15] Too Darn Hot\t\t\t\t- Erasure\n[16] I Get A Kick Out Of You\t\t- Jungle Brothers\n[17] Down In The Depths\t\t\t- Lisa Stansfield\n[18] From This Moment On\t\t\t- Jimmy Somerville\n[19] After You Who\t\t\t\t- Jody Watley\n[20] Do I Love You\t\t\t\t- Aztec Camera\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:17m:50s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 198mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Jazz Various\n\nOriginally Released\t- 25 September 1990\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Chrysalis Records\n \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa2e165a2290eb657ab898bf9716f8b35c65001","amp;dn":"%5B1990%5D+Red+Hot+%2B+Blue+A+Tribute+To+Cole+Porter+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1jo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa2e165a2290eb657ab898bf9716f8b35c65001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,162,225,101,162,41,14,182,87,171,137,139,249,113,111,139,53,198,80,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
