Collected together in a handsome boxed set, this is the perfect gift for any Civil War buff. \n\nFort Sumter to Perryville \n&quot;Here, for a certainty, is one of the great historical narratives of our century, a unique and brilliant achievement, one that must be firmly placed in the ranks of the masters.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Van Allen Bradley, Chicago Daily News \n\n&quot;Anyone who wants to relive the Civil War, as thousands of Americans apparently do, will go through this volume with pleasure.... Years from now, Foote's monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€New York Herald Tribune Book Review \n\nFredericksburg to Meridian \n&quot;This, then, is narrative historyÃ¢â‚¬â€a kind of history that goes back to an older literary tradition.... The writing is superb...one of the historical and literary achievements of our time.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post Book World \n\n&quot;Gettysburg...is described with such meticulous attention to action, terrain, time, and the characters of the various commanders that I understand, at last, what happened in that battle.... Mr. Foote has an acute sense of the relative importance of events and a novelist's skill in directing the reader's attention to the men and the episodes that will influence the course of the whole war, without omitting items which are of momentary interest. His organization of facts could hardly be bettered.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Atlantic \n\nRed River to Appomattox \n&quot;An unparalleled achievement, an American Iliad, a unique work uniting the scholarship of the historian and the high readability of the first-class novelist.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Walker Percy \n\n&quot;I have never read a better, more vivid, more understandable account of the savage battling between Grant's and Lee's armies.... Foote stays with the human strife and suffering, and unlike most Southern commentators, he does not take sides. In objectivity, in range, in mastery of detail in beauty of language and feeling for the people involved, this work surpasses anything else on the subject.... It stands alongside the work of the best of them.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€New Republic\n\nWritten by Shelby Foote \nRead by Alexander Adams \nFormat: MP3 \nUnabridged \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents. ;)\n_______________________________\n                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The_Abee/&lt;/a&gt;\n_______________________________\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n :)__Abee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2927b0cb178057096f26082d05cff1ca073f8b0","amp;dn":"Civil+War+Volumes+1-3+Box+Set+-+A+Narrative+-+Shelby+Foote+%28Abee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2927b0cb178057096f26082d05cff1ca073f8b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,146,123,12,177,120,5,112,150,242,96,130,208,92,255,28,160,115,248,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
