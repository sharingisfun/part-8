Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text.\nA balance of theory, worked examples and extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 468 new or changed homework problems for the fifth edition and robust media offerings, renders the fifth edition the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis.\n\nThis edition retains the Design a Problem feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question as well as the solution. There are over 100 Design a Problem exercises integrated into the problem sets in the book.\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nDr. Charles K. Alexander (Athens, OH) is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Ohio and served as the President and CEO of the IEEE from 1996-1999.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2823f656415d6e3619b7790936c017178f60e31c","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Electric+Circuits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2823f656415d6e3619b7790936c017178f60e31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,35,246,86,65,93,110,54,25,183,121,9,54,192,23,23,143,96,227,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
