An eight-member ensemble, the Mowgli's fill their songs with a panoply of instruments from guitars and keyboards to horns and melodica, and deliver each songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chorus with a crowd of heterogeneous voices, shouting to the hilt as if the album was less a studio-crafted effort and more of a flashmob recorded on CD. In that sense, the band often bring to mind their many folksy, similarly inclined contemporaries like Mumford &amp; Sons, the Lumineers, and Grouplove. \n\n  * Singer/songwriters Colin Louis Dieden and Katie Jayne Earl garner most of the vocal spotlight here, sometimes bringing to mind the '70s country-rock of Fleetwood Mac. Songs like the rocking title track, the equally rambling &quot;Leave It Up to Me,&quot; and the uplifting anthem &quot;The Great Divide&quot; have a buoyant, authentic '60s hippie quality that sound like a more mainstream take on the neo-psychedelic sounds of the Flaming Lips. Elsewhere, cuts like &quot;San Francisco,&quot; &quot;Love Is Easy,&quot; and &quot;Say It, Just Say It&quot; have an optimistic lyrical tone and catchy melodicism that, as with all of Waiting for the Dawn, makes for enjoyable, laid-back listening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a15126c63ac0d38da0cb27eecc8e88ff5c744e28","amp;dn":"The+Mowgli%27s+-+Waiting+for+the+Dawn+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a15126c63ac0d38da0cb27eecc8e88ff5c744e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,81,38,198,58,192,211,141,160,203,39,238,204,142,136,255,92,116,78,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
