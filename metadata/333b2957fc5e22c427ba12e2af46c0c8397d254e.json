Bella is Thompson's fourth album released on the record label Verve Forecast. The album is produced by David Kahne, whose previous collaborations include Paul McCartney, Regina Spector and The Strokes. Bella contains all original songs which Thompson started working on after returning from his last tour. Thompson crafted the songs for the album going to a Manhattan office every day honing in as a record deadline drew closer. The album single is called &quot;'Looking for a Girl&quot; and was released on January 13, 2011 on Verve Forecast.\n\nBella has received positive reviews in the UK and the US with critics praising Thompson for crafting another solid album as a follow up to 2008`s A Piece Of What You Need. Critics also note that this is Thompson`s most personal record to date which yet again shows off his talent as a vocalist and craftsman of both deeply personal and hummable pop tunes.\n\nRipped from Spotify\n\nNjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:333b2957fc5e22c427ba12e2af46c0c8397d254e","amp;dn":"Bella+-+Teddy+Thompson+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"333b2957fc5e22c427ba12e2af46c0c8397d254e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,59,41,87,252,94,34,196,39,186,18,226,175,70,192,200,57,125,37,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
