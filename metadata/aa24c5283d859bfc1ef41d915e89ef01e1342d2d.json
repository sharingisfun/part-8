Woodward, &quot;The Art and Architecture of Thailand: From Prehistoric Times Through the Thirteenth Century&quot; \nEnglish | 2005 | ISBN: 9004144404 | PDF | 297 pages | 12,8 mb\n\nWritten sources on Thai history are scarce. It took Hiram Woodward many years of painstaking archaeological and art-historical research to finally piece together this first ever comprehensive survey work on the art and architecture of Thailand from the earliest times until the establishment of the Thai-speaking kingdoms. The book, organized geographically and chronologically, covers four eras: the prehistoric period; the period characterized by the culture of the kingdom of Dvaravati; the centuries of Khmer dominance; and, as classical Khmer civilization waned, the period of the struggle for identity. A systematic and elucidating history of pre-fourteenth-century Thailand in a volume indispensable to historians of art, religion, politics, and society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa24c5283d859bfc1ef41d915e89ef01e1342d2d","amp;dn":"The+Art+and+Architecture+of+Thailand+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa24c5283d859bfc1ef41d915e89ef01e1342d2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,36,197,40,61,133,155,252,30,244,29,145,94,137,239,1,225,52,45,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
