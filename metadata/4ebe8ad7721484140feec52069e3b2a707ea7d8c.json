Whether you're looking for information in flat files, via FTP, or on the web, SSIS allows you to transform it all into a uniform format for databases. In this course, Ron Davis teaches this mission-critical skill for IT professionals, developers, and data analysts. Ron covers the architecture of SQL Server Integration Services, the platform's tools, basic task scripting, and the variables, parameters, and expressions you can use to customize your ETL packages. Plus, discover how to use containers to group and repeat tasks, how to merge datasets with joins, and how to debug packages, and learn about common design patterns that will increase your efficiency in SSIS.\n\nTopics include:\n\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCreating SSIS packages\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tCoding and looping tasks\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tManaging and administering SQL with SSIS tasks\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tOptimizing data for extraction\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tMaking packages dynamic with variables and parameters\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tUsing sequences in a container\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tPerforming joins\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tHandling errors\n\tÃ¢â‚¬Â¢\tWorking with XML\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ebe8ad7721484140feec52069e3b2a707ea7d8c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+SQL+Server+Integration+Services+with+Ron+Davis+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ebe8ad7721484140feec52069e3b2a707ea7d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,190,138,215,114,20,132,20,15,238,197,32,105,227,178,167,7,234,125,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
