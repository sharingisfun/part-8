Users cannot access the files on the raw disk and if a disk reads as raw in Windows, Maybe you will encounter any one of the conditions in the following cases:\r\n\r\n- Invalid media type reading drive. Abort, Retry, Fail?\r\n- File system is displayed as RAW\r\n- Windows may show disk not formatted. Do you want to format now?\r\n- File names contain weird characters\r\n- Sector not found messages\r\n- Drive is inaccessible due to corrupt MFT, DBR or other reason\r\n- Check drive properties: RAW file system and 0 bytes used space\r\n\r\niData RAW Partition Recovery software can easily fix RAW drive, recover RAW partition, repair damaged or corrupted hard drive and convert RAW to NTFS/FAT32 without data loss. After recovering RAW partition, you will get all data back and then access RAW drive as normal.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\n- Official site does not provide any info about changes in this version\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n1.
