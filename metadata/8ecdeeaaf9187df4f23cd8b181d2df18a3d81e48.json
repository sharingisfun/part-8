King standard &quot;3 O'clock in the Morning&quot; and the electrifying Luther Allison's &quot;Part Time Love,&quot; a Motown gem from early in his career, provide satisfying surprises.\n \nMuch of the music has a folksy feel, especially the work of Mississippi John Hurt, an acoustic purist until the end, who rolls through a back-to-the-basics &quot;Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor,&quot; and that of voluntary European exile Memphis Slim, whose piano-powered &quot;Stewball&quot; features the legendary Willie Dixon on bass. \nOther legends, including John Lee Hooker and Junior Wells, are well represented, but it's Memphis Minnie, a seminal guitar star of the 1930s, who steals the show with her empowered &quot;I Got to Make a Change Blues.&quot;\n\nThis deep, wide, multihued collection of blues combines an expansive chronological and stylistic sweep with a commendable attention to entertainment value through its emphasis on the unexpected. \n\n\nVarious Artists\n\nPutumayo presents: Mississippi Blues\n\n2002\n\n\n  CD / 2002 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n \n1.
