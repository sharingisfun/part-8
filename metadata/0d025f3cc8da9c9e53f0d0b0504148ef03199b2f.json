The dictator has died, but his chief adviser (Raul Julia) doesn't want that news to come out; he'd rather continue the charade that the big guy is still in charge. And to his surprise, the actor discovers that he enjoys the acting challenge, until he figures out that Julia is positioning himself to take over as the country's true strongman. Naturally, Dreyfuss also discovers that, aside from enjoying the perks of power (including the late dictator's mistress, Sonia Braga), he actually has the power to do some good--to Julia's chagrin.\n\n  Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Raul Julia, Edward Asner, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters, Roger Aaron Brown, Dick Cavett, Charo.\n\n  Directed by: Paul Mazursky.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 44min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 384\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d025f3cc8da9c9e53f0d0b0504148ef03199b2f","amp;dn":"Moon+Over+Parador+%281988%29+%28Richard+Dreyfuss%2C+Raul+Julia%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d025f3cc8da9c9e53f0d0b0504148ef03199b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,2,95,60,200,218,156,158,83,240,208,176,80,65,72,239,3,25,155,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
