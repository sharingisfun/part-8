The subtitles are permanent, and only in Non-English situations. \n\nA drawback, on this, the only known DVD version of the film, is that it is in 4:3, and there is a debate as to whether it is open matte or pan &amp; scan.  Apparently this was approved by Hartley, though I can't find a proper reference.\n\nThe only known bit of Hal himself acting, playing the boyfriend, Hal, of his future wife, Miho Nikaido. Some Butoh-esque dance sequences.\n\nThe stories go through a bit of scrambling, so don't expect the same exact formulation in each.  The words get used over and over again.  Especially the word &quot;No!&quot;.\n\nFlirtation aplenty. Some classic Hartley dancing, dialogue, and lavatory philosophizing.\n\nUncompressed PAL DVD5 VIDEO_TS files.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05bdf47b5f20e346dceb03d3b24e01725e501416","amp;dn":"Hal+Hartley+-+Flirt+%281995%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05bdf47b5f20e346dceb03d3b24e01725e501416","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,189,244,123,95,32,227,70,220,235,3,211,178,78,1,114,94,80,20,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
