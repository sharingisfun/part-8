He was only sixteen, but he understood that his family couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep living on bread and beef jerky. In town one day, he noticed an advertisement for a mail order bride, and sent off a letterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦after signing his older brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just make sure to tell Andrew that his fiance was coming before she arrived. What could go wrong? \n\nTracy had lived in an orphanage since she was just a few months old. She only had a month before she turned eighteen and had to find a new place to live, complete with employment or a wedding ring. There were no jobs worth taking for a young woman, so she answered a letter requesting a mail order bride. Andrew sounded perfect. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d meet him, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be thrilled to see her, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d live happily ever after. Right?
