When shocking new evidence exonerates the man Olivia is sure she saw abduct her sister, she breaks every rule in the book to uncover the truth.\nDriven by the possibility that she put the wrong man behind bars, Olivia discovers that a serial killer has been at large all these years. Believing that the monster has just struck again in Seattle, Olivia leaves her lab and poses as a field agent, sharing her unofficial investigation with a hardworking Seattle cop. Olivia doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to lie to detective Zack Travis. And she certainly doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to fall in love. But as the investigation intensifies, Olivia and Zack find that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rapidly losing controlÃ¢â‚¬â€œover their hearts, their secrets, and a case that threatens to consume them.\n\nTo leave a Request please visit My Release Thread.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank You.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584b4713e5bc1de78ec9b4de6345116093e06528","amp;dn":"The+Kill+by+Allison+Brennan+%5BPredator+%233%5D+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584b4713e5bc1de78ec9b4de6345116093e06528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,75,71,19,229,188,29,231,142,201,180,222,99,69,17,96,147,224,101,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
