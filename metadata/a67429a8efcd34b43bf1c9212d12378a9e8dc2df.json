It is transparent  and increases\n  rms level, but when pushed  hard  it  starts  saturating with  a nice and useful\n  distortion.\n\n  The original compressor has been expanded with  a  sidechain unit which includes\n  sidechain filters and a sample-aligned dry-wet mix for immediate parallel\n  compression.\n\n\n\nSKnote.DDD.Demension.Chorus.VST.v1.0.0\n\n\n\n  DDD is a stereo &quot;dimension&quot; chorus, modeled  after  a  well  known hardware rack\n  device.\n\n  Chorus  effect  is  achieved through  analog  delay devices, namely &quot;BBD&quot; Bucket\n  Brigade delay lines.\n\n  Several algorithms are aimed to give a track &quot;dimension&quot; and stereo width  while\n  avoiding vibrato and typical pitch shifting effects.\n\n  All  stages   are   modeled,  including  the  companding   section,   an  analog\n  expansion-compression  system  which optimizes the signal for the analog  delay,\n  and the BBD lines with their level and frequency dependent sound.\n\n  An  input  gain  control  (balanced for constant output level), together with an\n  input level and a companding  meter,  gives  control on the sound, from clean to\n  dirty, while providing an inside view on the internal processing.\n\n\n\nSKnote.Grasso.Saturation.and.Dynamics.VST.1.0.0\n\n\n\n  &quot;Grasso&quot; (Italian for &quot;Fat&quot;)  is  an  effect for saturation, drive, compression,\n  from subtle to distortion. A mixing and mastering effect.\n\n  FEATURES:\n\n\n  - tube-modeling.\n  - level-independent dynamics.\n  - level-independent dynamic filtering (on full signal, attack or decay).\n  - detailed control on tube circuits with several options.\n  - &quot;spank&quot; feature (post-drive dynamic response, on attack and decay).\n  - modeled &quot;weak&quot; power supply (more harmonics or &quot;sagging&quot;).\n  - special post drive expander for great dynamics.\n\n\nSKnote.MCAudioLab.EQ1.VST.v1.0.0.FIXED\n\n\n\n  MCAudioLab EQ1  is  a  passive EQ VST  and  AU plug-in for Windows and Mac OS X.\n  It's a software emulation of the hardware EQ1.\n\n  With the software version you get a number of additional goodies: dual channel\n  operation (L-R or M-S) with linked or independent controls, switchable\n  tube/solid state power supply and master output level controls.\n\n  FEATURES:\n\n\n  - Single channel class A 3-band passive tube equalizer.\n  - LF: shelving, typical Boost/Cut controls, stepped frequency\n    selector (Boost 1x, Cut 10x).\n  - HMF Boost: parametric, stepped frequency selector, Q control.\n  - HF Cut: shelving, stepped frequency selector.\n  - Extremely low distortion and noise floor, high headroom.\n  - Tube make-up gain stage with Lundahl transformer in output.\n  - 3-LED output level meter.\n  - True bypass switch.\n  - Separate Ground and Earth lift switches to avoid ground loops.\n  - Optional solid state power supply (EQ1ch).\n\n\n\nSKnote.Rev250.Digital.Reverb.VST.v1.0.0\n\n\n\n  Rev250 is a reverb modeled after the first digital reverb.\n\n  Sounds very deep, with lots of attitude.\n\n  Mid-side balance for stereo width control.\n\n  Includes additional effects from the original units: chorus, phaser, delay.\n\n  All stages are emulated, including input conversion.\n\n  Gain control and meter, from lo-fi to clean.\n\n\n\nSKnote.Roundtone.Tape.Emulation.VST.v3.0.2\n\n\n\n  Roundtone  is  a  stereo/mono  tape  emulation  software. It adds  typical  tape\n  recording interesting side-effects to every audio track.\n \n  Useful on single tracks (mono/stereo) and on submixes/mixes.\n  Very light on CPU and latency-free, adds punch, color and gently compresses\n  the sound.\n  Includes several algorithms (different tape, saturation curve, color,\n  response).\n  &quot;Emphasis&quot; control adds color while preserving the high frequencies.\n  Includes an optional 2nd stage of saturation (head).  \n\n  Changes in v3:\n\n  New &quot;Bright Formula&quot; and &quot;Lo-Fi&quot;  \n  Stereo Tape Delay.\n  Wow and Flutter.\n  Noise.\n  New B enhancer.\n  Noise.\n  New meter.\n\n\n\nSKnote.Stagespace.Algorithmic.Reverb.VST.v1.0.1\n\n\n\n  Stagespace  is  a  versatile  and  smooth algorithmic reverb  with  some  unique\n  features.\n\n  Envelope controls: &quot;body&quot; and &quot;fade&quot; for fuller options.\n\n  Use it as a clean, dense reverb or stress it.\n\n  Great for rooms and halls, adds depth without artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSKnote Plugins Pack Available as Win32/64 VST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      [Installation]\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Uninstall previous versions\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  UnRar.\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Select required files from VST_32/VST_64 dir and place to\n     your VSTPlugins folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
