I've been running away from the memories that haunt me for so long that depression has become my only comfort. I was content in the darkness...until Wes Michals offered to be my light.\n\nI didn't know that time wasn't my ally -- that every second that ticked past was one step closer to the end of something that was beginning to mean the end of myself. He tried to warn me. He promised me all he was able to offer--each moment as it came--but it would never be enough.\n\nSometimes when you think it's the end, it's only the beginning. Wes thought he could save me, but in giving me everything, he ruined me. Because after one kiss, one touch, I couldn't--I wouldn't ever be the same.\n\nAnd from that moment on, his heartbeat became my own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee655a6989b58a3b39c67b4600fd1412e590d24f","amp;dn":"Ruin+by+Rachel+Van+Dyken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee655a6989b58a3b39c67b4600fd1412e590d24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,101,90,105,137,181,138,59,57,198,123,70,0,253,20,18,229,144,210,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
