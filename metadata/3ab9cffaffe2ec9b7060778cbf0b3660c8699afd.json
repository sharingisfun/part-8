It is and will continue to be the central issue of politics in almost every nation on earth. In this book, the author explains inequality in clear, passionate, and intelligent prose: what it is, why it matters, how it affects us, what its underlying causes are, and what we might do about it. This book was written to encourage informed radical action by working people, the unemployed, and the poor, uniquely blending the authorâ€™s own experiences with his ability to make complex issues comprehensible to a mass audience. This book will be excellent for courses in a variety of disciplines, and it will be useful to activists and the general reading public","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab9cffaffe2ec9b7060778cbf0b3660c8699afd","amp;dn":"The+Great+Inequality+%282016%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab9cffaffe2ec9b7060778cbf0b3660c8699afd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,185,207,250,255,226,236,155,112,96,119,140,191,11,54,96,200,105,154,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
