Local favorites like trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, Preservation Hall Jazz Band and singer Topsy Chapman offer up traditional flavor as well.\n\nHighlighting a vibrant diversity of old and new talent, this album is a musical and cultural tour of New Orleans.\n\n\nVarious Artists\n\nPutumayo presents: New Orleans\n\n2005\n\n\n  CD / 2005 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n \n1.
