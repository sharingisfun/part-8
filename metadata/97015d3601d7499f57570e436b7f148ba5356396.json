This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\n&quot;Kiss On My List&quot; by Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates was badly edited as last week's number one, but sounds up to standard as this week's repeat number one.\n\nEmmylou Harris is at number 37 with her song &quot;Mister Sandman.&quot; Instead of playing the single release this week, Casey plays the album cut which has Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt singing back-up and tells why that version couldn't be released as a single\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What singer has had the longest span of hits on the Billboard charts?&quot; This man had the very first number 1 song on the first Billboard chart ever published in 1955, and went on to hit the chart 108 times in the next 40 years.\n\nCasey gives a report on the new wave of hair styles, a fashion that he says came straight out of the 1950's.\n\nThe is an artist in the countdown so intent on getting his Master's Degree in musical composition at Temple University in Philadelphia, that he won't let his record company send him on tour. He keeps practiced by playing concerts in local Philadelphia jails. Casey says if you want to see this artist, &quot;. . . get busted in Philadelphia.&quot;\n\nCasey intros the final segment by saying, &quot;Every week we countdown the most popular songs in the land from the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe, to the Rock Island Line; and up a notch to number two this week, here is Sheena Easton with, 'Morning Train'.&quot; &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; is a song popularized by Lead Belly in 1937, and &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot; is a song by Judy Garland from the film, &quot;The Harvey Girls.&quot; It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1946.\n\nLW#1: Kiss On My List - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n40:    Say You'll Be Mine - Christopher Cross\n39:    Wasn't That A Pity - The Rovers\n38:    A Woman Needs Love - Ray Parker Jr. &amp; Raydio            \n37:    Mister Sandman - Emmylou Harris\n36:    What Are We Doin' In Love - Dottie West\n35:    Turn Me Loose - Loverboy\n34:    The Party's Over - Journey\n33:    Hold On Loosely - .38 Special\n32:    Love You Like I Never Loved Before - John O'Banion\n31:    Don't Stop The Music - Yarbrough And Peoples\n30:    Sukiyaki - A Taste Of Honey\nARCHIVES: Help Me Rhonda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Beach Boys\n29:    I Missed Again - Phil Collins\n28:    It's A Love Thing - The Whispers\n27:    I Love You - Climax Blues Band        \n26:    How 'Bout Us - Champaign\n25:    Watching The Wheels - John Lennon\n24:    You Better You Bet - The Who\n23:    Sweetheart - Franke &amp; The Knockouts\n22:    Time Out Of Mind - Steely Dan\nLDD: The Name Of The Game - ABBA\n21:    Just Between You And Me - April Wine\nARCHIVES: Back In My Arms Again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Supremes\n20:    Ain't Even Done With The Night - John Cougar\n19:    Too Much Time On My Hands - Styx\n18:    Bette Davis Eyes - Kim Carnes\n17:    Take It On The Run - REO Speedwagon\n16:    Living Inside Myself - Gino Vannelli\n15:    Crying - Don Mclean\n14:    Keep On Loving You - REO Speedwagon\n13:    Somebody's Knockin' - Terri Gibbs\n12:    Her Town Too - James Taylor &amp; J.D.
