A musician himself, who overcame crushing poverty and staggering tragedies, Hall brought black and white musicians together Ã¢â‚¬â€ including during times when the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s governor wanted &quot;segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ to create music that would last for generations while also giving birth to the unique Muscle Shoals sound, and the unheralded but crucial rhythm section, The Swampers.\n\nWhile fending off a budding rivalry in the Muscle Shoals heyday with Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, which was formed by The Swampers and would find huge success of its own, Hall maintained confidence in his brand and in himself.\n\nFreddy CamalierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film brings in legendary artists including Aretha Franklin, DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother Gregg Allman, Bono, Clarence Carter, Jimmy Cliff, Mick Jagger, Alicia Keys, Keith Richards, Percy Sledge, Steve Winwood, and others, as well as archival interviews with the late Wilson Pickett and Etta James, all who bear witness to the magnetism and mystery of Muscle Shoals and why it remains a global influence today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b87881d898952d5b13efa04b6e8413eabf4e6e","amp;dn":"PBS+-+Independent+Lens+-+Muscle+Shoals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b87881d898952d5b13efa04b6e8413eabf4e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,184,120,129,216,152,149,45,91,19,239,160,75,110,132,19,234,191,78,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
