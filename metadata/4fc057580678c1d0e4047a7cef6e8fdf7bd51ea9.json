Quality is still good and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smooth. You may see that I toggle the player one or two times just to check the remaining time. Other than that I will continue screen capturing until I can find a way to rip it directly from the rtmp. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not as easy as it was on the WWE Network thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to say the least.
