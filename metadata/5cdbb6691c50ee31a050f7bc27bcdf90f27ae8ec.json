Never seen it outside Iceland in any way, and any information on it is hard to come by on the Internet.\nThe musical style could perhaps be described as some sort of scaldic mix between atmospheric ambient/lounge music, with spoken words largely (or entirely) based on old Nordic scriptures, such as the Egil Skallagrimssons Saga, the Edda etc.\n\nI scanned and compiled the cover into a PDF file, without it it wouldn't be worth much to you non-Icelanders!\n\nAnd yeah, there are &quot;9&quot; tracks on the CD, but in reality these are complied into only three tracks - not my fault, that's the way things were and I'm not changing it.\n\nShare and seed until RagnarÃƒÂ¶k!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cdbb6691c50ee31a050f7bc27bcdf90f27ae8ec","amp;dn":"Atli+%26Ouml%3Brvarsson+-+The+Soul+of+the+Great+Viking-320kbps-%5BDerH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cdbb6691c50ee31a050f7bc27bcdf90f27ae8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,219,182,105,28,80,238,49,160,80,247,188,39,188,223,144,242,122,232,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
