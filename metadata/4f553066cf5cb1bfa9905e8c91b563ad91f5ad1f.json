It&amp;#039;s a comedy classic in which Johnson and Olsen preside over the gags, wisecracks and mayhem. A projectionist (Howard) tries to run a film while arguing with his girlfriend, only to have the stars step out and remonstrate with him; a woman with a pot plant wanders in and out of scenes and there is some very odd business with a private eye.
