YOU DO NOT NEED THIS!\n\nOk Ok - I put in all the rest of the stuff I&amp;#039;ve found on bittorrent - and improved - I have tagged it all, cover art, even lyrics (IN THE TAGS). So it is better than the stuff that has been on bittorrent forever. But YOU DON&amp;#039;T NEED IT. I included what you need in Parts 1-8, this is just stuff you (and I) will find when you search bittorrent. It&amp;#039;s extra. Believe me! But I know you won&amp;#039;t so here it is. But given these caveats, I don&amp;#039;t know how long *I* will seed this since it is bittorrent available - AND redundant. But - hey - I WAS trying to supercede all the old stuff. I&amp;#039;ll support this for a while - but if you get it, seed it, because I will drop this as soon as I get an inkling to do so.\n\nSO - just in case - put on &quot;high priority&quot; the pieces you want, because you MAY not get it all. I&amp;#039;ll try, but no promises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf30c555248cc08662f905b1b162a418fa63391","amp;dn":"John+Denver+Discography+Part+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bf30c555248cc08662f905b1b162a418fa63391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,243,12,85,82,72,204,8,102,47,144,91,27,22,42,65,143,166,51,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
