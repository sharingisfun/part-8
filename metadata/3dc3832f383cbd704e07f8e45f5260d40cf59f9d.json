Janos (Lars Rudolph) is a wide-eyed innocent who works as an occasional postal worker and as a caretaker for Mr. Ezster (Peter Fitz). An outsider and a visionary, he marvels at the miracles of creation, from the planets rotating in the heavens to the sundry animals on earth. One day, a circus featuring jars full of medical anomalies and a massive dead whale entombed in a corrugated metal trailer visits Jancos' economically depressed village. Another more sinister attraction is a shadowy figure dubbed &quot;The Prince,&quot; whose nihilist rants incite the town's disaffected to riot. Not long afterwards, Mrs. Ezster (Hanna Schygulla) cajoles her estranged husband to join a citizen's action group against the circus, threatening to move back into his house if he doesn't play along. Tension in the town builds until, after one of The Prince's hate-filled speeches, throngs of angry men with blunt instruments ransack and brutalize a men's hospital ward. When the dust clears, lives are irrevocably changed. This film was screened at the 2000 Toronto Film Festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Hungarian\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc3832f383cbd704e07f8e45f5260d40cf59f9d","amp;dn":"Werckmeister+Harmoniak+2000+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc3832f383cbd704e07f8e45f5260d40cf59f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,195,131,47,56,60,189,112,78,7,248,228,95,82,96,212,12,245,159,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
