Beginning with one irresistible idea--a complete home bar of just 12 key bottles--hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how to make more than 200 classic and unique mixed drinks, including sours, slings, toddies, and highballs, plus the perfect Martini, the perfect Manhattan, and the perfect Mint Julep.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a surprising guide--tequila didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make the cut, and neither did bourbon, but genever did. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a literate guide--describing with great liveliness everything from the importance of vermouth and bitters (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“salt and pepperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of mixology) to the story of a punch bowl so big it was stirred by a boy in a rowboat.\n\nBy David Solmonson\nPublished by Workman Publishing Company in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 416 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82f343d4dda2a7ba190c81cc8f1ba1af96ebcfc","amp;dn":"The+12+Bottle+Bar+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82f343d4dda2a7ba190c81cc8f1ba1af96ebcfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,47,52,61,77,218,42,123,161,144,200,28,200,241,186,26,249,110,188,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
