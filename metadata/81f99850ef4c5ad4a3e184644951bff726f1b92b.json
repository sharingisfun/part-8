Chad Kroeger)\n\n\n\nReleased\t: 15 October 2013\nFormat\t: Digital download, CD single\nRecorded\t: 2013\nGenre\t: Rock, pop rock\nLength\t: 4:29 (Album Version)\n3:57 (Radio Edit)\nLabel\t: Epic\nWriter(s) : Avril Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges\nProducers : Chad Kroeger, David Hodges\nArtist : AVRIL LEVIGNE \n\n\n\n\nLet Me Go&quot; is a song by Avril Lavigne, released as the third single from her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), on October 15, 2013. It features vocals from Lavigne's husband, Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger and was written by Lavigne and Kroeger along with David Hodges, with Kroeger also producing it. It was her first single to feature a guest performer. &quot;Let Me Go&quot; is a piano-driven power ballad, which features Lavigne painfully reminiscing over a failed love.\n\nInitially, &quot;Let Me Go&quot; was about letting go of someone and having them let go of you. However, &quot;Let Me Go&quot;'s lyrics were changed by Lavigne and Kroeger to reflect their relationship. Therefore, the message of the song is more the journey of love through one's life. Critics gave the song mixed reviews, with some calling it &quot;a monster duet&quot;, and others criticizing Kroeger's vocals and his involvement in the track.\n\nA music video was released on October 15, 2013, and it shows Lavigne roaming the halls of an abandoned mansion, with Kroeger's appearance being channeled through an elderly yardman, only to be seen as his true self through mirrored and tablet-assisted images. The song debuted at number 37 on the Billboard Adult Pop Songs and at number 78 on Billboard Hot 100. It has also debuted at number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100, after charting in three airplay formats and debuting at number 7 on the Digital Singles Chart\n\n[img]http://static.gigwise.com/artists/lavignenewalbum600.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f99850ef4c5ad4a3e184644951bff726f1b92b","amp;dn":"Avril+Levigne+-+Let+Me+Go+%28feat.+Chad+Kroeger%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f99850ef4c5ad4a3e184644951bff726f1b92b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,249,152,80,239,76,90,212,163,225,132,100,73,81,191,247,38,241,185,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
