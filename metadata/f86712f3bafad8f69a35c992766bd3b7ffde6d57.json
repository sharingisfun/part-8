This is for &quot;purists&quot; only.  Those who want a properly-functioning machine should bite the bullet and figure out how to force a load of XP Pro.\n\nThere are four NERO .NRG format ISO files. Burn all four to DVD's (trust me on this!) and boot to the SYS disc first,  from a USB DVD drive.  It will call for the RESTORE discs one and two,  then the LANGUAGE disc.  \n\nThen, only six hours later,  you will be waiting while it sucks in the dozens of &quot;free trials&quot; and finally finishes and slows to a crawl.  GEEZ!  Get a LIFE,  Acer and Microsoft!   This is AWFUL!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86712f3bafad8f69a35c992766bd3b7ffde6d57","amp;dn":"Acer+Aspire+One+Windows+7+Restore+DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f86712f3bafad8f69a35c992766bd3b7ffde6d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,103,18,243,186,250,216,246,154,53,201,146,118,107,211,183,255,222,109,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
