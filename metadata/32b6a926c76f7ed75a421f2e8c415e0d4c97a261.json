Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nClub Ninja is the tenth studio album by the U.S. hard rock group Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, released in 1985 (see 1985 in music). The album was intended as a comeback for the band, whose previous album The RevÃƒÂ¶lution by Night failed to attain Gold status following the success of 1981's Fire of Unknown Origin and 1982's Extraterrestrial Live. Club Ninja sold more than 175,000 copies, falling well short of gold status again, and because of its high cost, Columbia Records executives deemed it a commercial failure. The album was re-issued on compact disc on March 10, 2009, by the Sony-owned reissue label American Beat Records, who had also reissued the band's subsequent 1988 album, Imaginos.\n\nClub Ninja's first single, &quot;Dancin' in the Ruins,&quot; was a minor radio and MTV hit. &quot;When the War Comes&quot; features a brief spoken-word introduction by radio personality Howard Stern, whose cousin was married to guitarist and vocalist Eric Bloom. The lyrics to &quot;Spy in the House of the Night&quot; were written by Richard Meltzer, originally based on his poem &quot;Out of Smokes,&quot; which was published in his 1999 book &quot;Holes.&quot;\n\nClub Ninja is the only Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult studio album not to feature keyboardist Allen Lanier. He was replaced temporarily by Tommy Zvoncheck, who'd previously been keyboardist for Aldo Nova's live band, for a Japanese tour by Public Image Ltd. and had already contributed to the initial recordings of Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's 1988 concept album Imaginos.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b6a926c76f7ed75a421f2e8c415e0d4c97a261","amp;dn":"Blue+Oyster+Cult+-+Club+Ninja+%5B1985%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b6a926c76f7ed75a421f2e8c415e0d4c97a261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,182,169,38,199,111,126,215,90,66,31,46,140,65,94,13,76,151,162,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
