We'll experience and see these habitats from a new visual perspective, pushing between blades of grass will feel like journeying deep into the densest jungle, while running from a hunting lizard will feel like a visit to Jurassic Park.\r\nThis is a different approach to a traditional wildlife series. Based entirely on biologically accurate behaviour, it employs a unique range of filming techniques and constructed storytelling to recreate these animals' own distinctive perspectives and to illustrate the dynamism of their lives.\r\nJourney behind the scenes with Hidden Kingdoms to explore some of the techniques used to create this unique viewpoint, and why they were so important when revealing behaviour never before filmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Under Open Skies \r\nIn Africa's savannah, a baby elephant shrew learns how speed is the secret to survival amongst the largest animals on earth. And in America, a young grasshopper mouse confronts the Wild West's deadliest creatures to stake a claim of his own.\r\n\r\n2)  Secret Forests \r\nIn the wild woods of North America, a young chipmunk is gathering a vital store of nuts ahead of his first winter - in his way are ruthless rivals and giant predators. In the steaming rainforest, a young tree shrew is forced deep into the jungle to find food. She must draw on all her intelligence and agility if she is to escape the ultimate jungle predator - a reticulated python!\r\n\r\n3)  Urban Jungles \r\nIn the colourful and chaotic streets of Rio, a young marmoset is separated from his street gang and forced to confront of the dangers of the city alone. In the futuristic metropolis of Tokyo, a rhinoceros beetle escapes his captors and begins an extraordinary journey through this alien world to find sanctuary.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c7/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/82/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/52/Hidden-Kingdoms-BBC-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~4017Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 256Kbps ABR 48KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 6\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.75 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01nppg8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06df644caf1fe598c990383a2280dabdc78a55d4","amp;dn":"BBC+Hidden+Kingdoms+1of3+Under+Open+Skies+1080p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06df644caf1fe598c990383a2280dabdc78a55d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,223,100,76,175,31,229,152,201,144,56,58,34,128,218,189,199,138,85,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
