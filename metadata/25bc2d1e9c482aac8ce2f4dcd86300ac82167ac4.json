OCR is not perfect, so the functionality of search is somewhat limited\n(OCR incorrectly recognizes some words, so searching for them yields no results).\n\nTo compensate for the OCR errors &amp; the simple table of contents in the guide, a more\nelaborate index was created using bookmarks (complete with expandable categories) \n\nIf you look closely, some of the artwork has a bit of a white, grainy look -\nthis isn't due to the scan, that's just how the pictures are in the guide.\n\nSpecial thanks to Piggyback Interactive for creating the guide and to gamegotme for taking the time to scan each page.\n\n\nABOUT:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The complete official guide to FINAL FANTASY XIII.
