Divorce has given us some of the best music of the twentieth century, touring is a monstrous hardship that gives us live music; sometimes managers run off with an artist's nest egg, forcing the artists out of retirement to become financially solvent. The latter happened to Leonard Cohen, and it forced the 73-year-old Canadian bard to embark on his first tour in over a decade. In 2008 most of his dates were confined to Europe, and 2009 saw him hit American shores, bringing his unique blend of music and poetry. The Live in London DVD is taken from a show on July 17th at London's O2 arena. The show, which runs over two hours long, is split into two sets:\n\nSet One\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Dance Me To The End Of Love&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;The Future&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Ain't No Cure For Love&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Bird On The Wire&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;In My Secret Life&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Who By Fire&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Anthem&quot;\n\nSet Two\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Introduction&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Tower Of Song&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Suzanne&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;The Gypsy's Wife&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Boogie Street&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Hallelujah&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Democracy&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;I'm Your Man&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Recitation w/ N.L.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Take This Waltz&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Sisters Of Mercy&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Closing Time&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;I Tried To Leave You&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Whither Thou Goest&quot;\n\nThe Band:\nLeonard Cohen (Guitar, Arranger, Keyboards, Vocals)\nSharon Robinson (Background Vocals)\nThe Webb Sisters\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Charley Webb (Guitar, Background Vocals)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hattie Webb (Harp, Background Vocals)\nDino Soldo (Harmonica, Keyboards, Background Vocals, Wind Instruments)\nJavier Mas (12-string Guitar, Archlute, Laud, Bandurria)\nRoscoe Beck (Electric Bass, Standup Bass, Background Vocals)\nNeil Larsen (Keyboards)\nBob Metzger (Guitar, Pedal Steel)\nRafael Gayol (Percussion, Drums)\n\n************************\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I cannot seed 24/7 and sometimes have connection issues, so please be patient.
