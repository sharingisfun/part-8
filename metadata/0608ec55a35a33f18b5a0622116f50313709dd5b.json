It was founded in 667 B.C.E. as Byzantium. Then, in 330, the Roman Emperor Constantine I christened it as New Rome. Later, it would come to bear his own name and be known as Constantinople, which was then rendered into Arabic languages as Kostantiniyye, which the Ottomans also adopted. The city was destined to finally be known in our modern age as Istanbul, derived from a Greek phrase meaning, simply, to the city. \nSo much has changed over the time those names spanned that it seems impossible they could possibly refer to only one city. Yet they do, and the city of Istanbul is still a vibrant place that treasures the artifacts of the various peoples who once lived here and knew it by such different names. \nOne phrase has also been used to name the city: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The City of the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Desire.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If judges could pick the most appropriate name for the city, perhaps they would choose this one, as it reflects most accurately how famous and how loved the city has been since antiquity. \nThe face of Istanbul has changed considerably inside the modern nation. JustinianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece, the Hagia Sophia, was turned into a museum and its wonderful mosaics were revealed to the world once more in 1935. Two bridges now span the Bosporus, and along with the historic skyline of the old city there are now also skyscrapers. \nToday, the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s importance in world history is indisputable, and it is difficult to believe that all of this long history concerns just one city. There is only one thing to do now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ visit!\n\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s go! \nYour guide, WanderStories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0608ec55a35a33f18b5a0622116f50313709dd5b","amp;dn":"Istanbur+Guide+-+WanderStories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0608ec55a35a33f18b5a0622116f50313709dd5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,8,236,85,163,90,51,241,139,90,6,34,17,111,80,49,55,9,221,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
