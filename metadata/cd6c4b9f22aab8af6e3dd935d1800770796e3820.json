McPhee can be violent\nand fierce, but he has that touch of sentimentality - in the good sense of the\nword - and spirituality that is entirely lacking with BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tzmann. The latter is a\nforce of nature, all power and energy, but he has his poetic side too. Besides\nthe violence, they share technical skills, musical vision and first and foremost\ninstruments that are a direct conduit to their feelings, unaltered, without\nembellishment, without unnecessary ornaments or fake feelings. They deliver\ndirectly : raw, authentic, true to themselves. Ken Kessler on bass and Michael\nZerang on drums feed the hurricane that is blowing in front of them,\nrelentlessly.\n\nBut the hurricane can become a light breeze too. And that is to a certain extent\nlargely to be ascribed to both McPhee and Kessler, who add more nuance and\nsubtlety, melodic elaboration and lyricism, but don't get mistaken about\nBrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tzmann either: the slow and very beautiful melody that he develops in the\nquiet middle part of the thirty-minute title song is entirely his, almost\nsounding like McPhee. It is a real pleasure how the German manages to find the\ncommon ground, but don't worry either, it doesn't take long before he blows his\nlungs out again, so much so, that it almost becomes an entertainment by\nitself. The second track, &quot;Alchemia Souls&quot;, is more free improv, a sound\ndialogue between the four musicians, and the title refers to the Alchemia Club,\nin Krakow, Poland were the performance took place on March 16, 2008.\n\nThe second disc is even better, with titles referring to the descent into the\nGreek underworld. Soft and poetic flowing passages alternate with gut-wrenching\nsound blasts and the most excruciating emotional explorations - after all: you\nare in hell, yet it all fits, it has coherence and purpose, indeed like Acheron,\nthe river of pain, that flows through Hades. Anger, human misery,\ndissatisfaction with the world, yes. But also musical beauty and great artistic\ndelivery, very balanced in a very varied performance.The only downside of the\nperformance is that BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tzmann's sax comes across much louder than McPhee's, but\nwhether that's a question of sound mixing or because of sheer decibels produced,\nremains unsolved.\n\n\nMore: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35472&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35472&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35075&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35075&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/25754-the-damage-is-done-joe-mcphee-peter-br-tzmann-kent-kessler-michael-zerang&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/25754-the-damage-is-done-joe-mcphee-peter-br-tzmann-kent-kessler-michael-zerang&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6c4b9f22aab8af6e3dd935d1800770796e3820","amp;dn":"Joe+McPhee%2C+Peter+Brotzmann%2C+Kent+Kessler%2C+Michael+Zerang+-+The+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd6c4b9f22aab8af6e3dd935d1800770796e3820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,108,75,159,34,170,184,175,110,61,217,53,209,128,7,112,121,110,56,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
