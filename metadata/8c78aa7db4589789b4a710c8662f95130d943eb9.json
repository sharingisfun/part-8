Both these fanzines had given away flexidiscs - indeed, AYSTGH had been part of the Sha-la-la organisation, a record label set up solely to produce flexidiscs. Several Sarah releases were fanzines and flexi-discs, as it was felt this summed up the aesthetic of the label better than 12&quot; singles and albums.[2]\n\nSarah Records was usually seen as being grounded in the C86 jangly indie-pop sensibility, though the late Seventies DIY scene and independent yet stylish and imaginative labels such as Postcard Records, Factory and Creation, plus the mid-Eighties fanzine culture, were bigger influences. It ceased operation with the release of There and Back Again Lane, the hundredth release in the main catalogue sequence - a booklet telling the story of the label, along with a CD of representative tracks. Half-page adverts entitled &quot;A Day For Destroying Things&quot; in both NME and Melody Maker marked the release. &quot;We don&amp;#039;t do encores&quot;, the advert announced, and the label has stuck by this sentiment, with no further releases. Bands on the label included Heavenly, East River Pipe, The Orchids, Even As We Speak, Boyracer, Brighter, Blueboy, The Field Mice, Another Sunny Day and St. Christopher.\n\nHaynes subsequently established Shinkansen Recordings, where many Sarah artists went on to record; he now edits a zine, Smoke, dedicated to writing and art inspired by London.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    * Sarah 001 The Sea Urchins, &quot;Pristine Christine&quot;, 1987\n    * Sarah 002 The Orchids, &quot;I&amp;#039;ve Got A Habit&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 003 Another Sunny Day, &quot;Anorak City&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 004 untitled fanzine, 1988\n    * Sarah 005 14 Iced Bears, &quot;Come Get Me&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 006 Poppyheads, &quot;Cremation Town&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 007 Another Sunny Day, &quot;I&amp;#039;m In Love With A Girl Who Doesn&amp;#039;t Know I Exist&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 008 The Sea Urchins, &quot;Solace&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 009 The Golden Dawn, &quot;My Secret World&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 010 Springfields, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 011 The Orchids, &quot;Underneath The Window, Underneath The Sink&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 012 The Field Mice, &quot;Emma&amp;#039;s House&quot;, 1988\n    * Sarah 013 Christine&amp;#039;s Cat, &quot;Your Love Is&quot;, 1989\n    * Sarah 014 &quot;lemonade&quot;
