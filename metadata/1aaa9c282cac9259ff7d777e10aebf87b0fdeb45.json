The iPhone's wide range of functionality, combined with its mobile, &quot;always on&quot; design, has allowed it to be used as a functional mobile office. The cost of this productivity is the danger of storing sensitive data on the device. Any given iPhone is likely to contain sensitive information belonging to its owner, and some types of information that may belong to othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½corporate email, documents, and photos, to name a few.\n\nAs the dark side of such a versatile device becomes more evident, so does a need to recover personal information from it.\n\nProblem employees engage in activities that put the company at risk, sometimes leaving an evidence trail on corporately owned equipment. The use of digital forensics has become an effective tool in conducting investigations and evaluating what activities a suspect employee has engaged in. Recovering deleted email, voicemail, photos, and other digital evidence can expose an employee who is stealing from the company, having an affair at work, or committing other acts that a corporation may need to investigate.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aaa9c282cac9259ff7d777e10aebf87b0fdeb45","amp;dn":"iPhone+Forensics+Recovering+Evidence%2C+Personal+Data%2C+and+Corpora","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aaa9c282cac9259ff7d777e10aebf87b0fdeb45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,170,156,40,44,172,146,89,255,125,119,126,16,174,191,135,176,253,235,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
