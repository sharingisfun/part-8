It was issued by EMI in the UK, and a few months later in the US, originally on Harvest/Capitol Records and subsequently Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records. The US version also included the song &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, previously released in the UK as a non-album single. In 1998, along with the rest of the band's pre-1995 releases, Iron Maiden was remastered with &quot;Sanctuary&quot; added in all territories.\n\nAlthough Iron Maiden have since criticised the quality of the album's production, the release was met with critical and commercial acclaim, debuting at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart as well as achieving prominence for the band in mainland Europe.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\t\n \t&quot;Prowler&quot;   \t  \t3:56 \t\n \t&quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;   \tHarris, Di'Anno \t5:29\n \t&quot;Running Free&quot;   \tHarris, Di'Anno \t3:17\n \t&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;   \t  \t7:08\n \t&quot;Transylvania&quot;   \t  \t4:19\n \t&quot;Strange World&quot;   \t  \t5:32\n        &quot;Sanctuary&quot;   \tHarris, Murray, Di'Anno \t3:16\n \t&quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot;   \tMurray \t4:13\n \t&quot;Iron Maiden&quot;   \t  \t3:36\n\nBonus Disc [320k MP3]\n\n \t&quot;Burning Ambition&quot;   \t  \t2:42\n \t&quot;Drifter&quot; (live) \t  \t6:04\n \t&quot;I've Got the Fire&quot; (live Montrose cover) \tRonnie Montrose \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    Paul Di'Anno Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\n    Steve Harris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Dennis Stratton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, backing vocals\n    Dave Murray Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Clive Burr Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a011d6af800d26c943b638d7c02f44b8ade9656","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Iron+Maiden+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a011d6af800d26c943b638d7c02f44b8ade9656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,1,29,106,248,0,210,108,148,59,99,141,124,2,244,75,138,222,150,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
