The album was released in 1983\n\nAfter guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke left MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead on their second US tour, Brian &quot;Robbo&quot; Robertson (ex-Thin Lizzy, Wild Horses) was drafted to complete the tour. On their return to the UK the band recorded their unique and controversial album - Another Perfect Day.\n\nAfter this album Robertson and Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor left to form the band Operator and Lemmy went on with MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead, forming the new line-up of Lemmy, Phil Campbell, WÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rzel, Pete Gill. None of the songs from the album were performed live after Robertson's departure in 1983 until 2004. Since then, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;, &quot;I Got Mine&quot; and &quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; have been featured in the band's live set.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc One\n\n\n01. \t&quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot;   \t4:14\n02. \t&quot;Shine&quot;   \t3:11\n03. \t&quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot;   \t4:29\n04. \t&quot;Rock it&quot;   \t3:55\n05. \t&quot;One Track Mind&quot;   \t5:55\n06. \t&quot;Another Perfect Day&quot;   \t5:29\n07. \t&quot;Marching off to War&quot;   \t4:11\n08. \t&quot;I Got Mine&quot;   \t5:24\n09. \t&quot;Tales of Glory&quot;   \t2:56\n10. \t&quot;Die You Bastard!&quot;   \t \n11. \t&quot;Turn You Round Again&quot; (Single B-Side)\n \t \nDisc Two\n\n\n01. \t&quot;Back at the Funny Farm&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n02. \t&quot;Tales of Glory&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n03. \t&quot;Heart of Stone&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n04. \t&quot;Shoot You in the Back&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n05. \t&quot;Marching off to War&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n06. \t&quot;Iron Horse/Born to Lose&quot; (Live) \tTaylor, Mick Brown, Lawrence \t \n07. \t&quot;Another Perfect Day&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n08. \t&quot;(I'm Your) Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; (Live) \tDixon \t6:31\n09. \t&quot;(Don't Need) Religion&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t2:54\n10. \t&quot;One Track Mind&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n11. \t&quot;Go to Hell&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n12. \t&quot;America&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n13. \t&quot;Shine&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n14. \t&quot;Dancing on Your Grave&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n15. \t&quot;Rock it&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n16. \t&quot;I Got Mine&quot; (Live) \t  \t \n17. \t&quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n18. \t&quot;The Chase Is Better Than the Catch&quot; (Live) \tClarke, Lemmy, Taylor \t \n\nMotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead\n\n    Lemmy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, vocals\n    Brian Robertson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, piano on &quot;Rock It&quot;\n    Phil &quot;Philthy Animal&quot; Taylor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9175034210b804fe2cb079cb1af70e50cfd9e653","amp;dn":"Motorhead+-+Another+Perfect+Day+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9175034210b804fe2cb079cb1af70e50cfd9e653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,117,3,66,16,184,4,254,44,176,121,203,26,247,14,80,207,217,230,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
