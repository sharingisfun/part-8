The novelty of this set is the way that Trane sort of sings, or vocalizes, or makes noises and beats his chest in the midst of Ã¢â‚¬Å“LeoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Favorite Things.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe band, (with the exception of Sonny Johnson subbing for bassist Jimmy Garrison) is the familiar 1966 unit comprised of Pharoah Sanders, Alice Coltrane, and Rashied Ali. Additionally, saxophonists Arnold Joyner and Steve Knoblauch join the group, as do percussionists Umar Ali, Algie DeWitt and Robert Kenyatta.\n\n'TraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is in absolute peak formÃ¢â‚¬â€pushing his ideas and the vocabulary of the sax ever further out, with minimalism-influenced fragments repeated and spun like mantras, church music melted into lava-flows of raw sound, and episodes where he simply hollers hoarse, wordless chants.\n\nHowever familiar we might be with ColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, there is always room for more of his wonderful music. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Offering: Live at Temple UniversityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is exhausting and uplifting, and documents a massive slice of emotional, raw and sometimes frenzied jazz - a new opportunity to hear the master reaching into his personal vortex and showering sparks into our darkness.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nOffering: Live at Temple University\n\n1966\n \n\n  2CDs / 2014 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / Disc 1: \n\n1.
