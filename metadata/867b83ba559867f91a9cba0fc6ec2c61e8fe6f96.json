Beware the larger torrent floating around, it is a fake circulated by Fish himself.  The first minute of each track loops to the song's official length, and the booklet is watermarked with the Scottish bastard's online shop. This torrent, on the other hand, is the real deal.\n\nAudio 9/10: MP3 at 320kbs, pristine quality\nAlbum 1/10: Churning out identical albums every 4 or 5 years has rendered this once energetic and brilliant artist to an old has been.  As a die hard fan, I was severely disappointed.  Boring and uninspiring, a poor and pale imitation of his earlier solo albums.  Certainly not worth anyone's money, but if you're into Dick Derek (Fish's real name), download this album and check it out.  Better then giving him your hard earned cash, this lacklustre effort does nothing to deserve it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867b83ba559867f91a9cba0fc6ec2c61e8fe6f96","amp;dn":"Fish+-+A+Feast+Of+Consequences+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867b83ba559867f91a9cba0fc6ec2c61e8fe6f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,123,131,186,85,152,103,249,26,156,186,15,198,236,44,97,232,254,111,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
