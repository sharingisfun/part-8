Focusing their attention on creating huge day-time blasting tracks for big crowds and monster sound systems, Killerwatts have spent countless hours perfecting each track, testing them on dance floors the world over with their extensive touring and then revisiting each track in the studio, tweaking each to perfection.\n\nNever shy to experiment and push their sonic limits Killerwatts also teamed up with young Brazillian Psy sensation Waio on 2 tracks that are sure fire dance floor hits.\n\nTristan and Avalon on one album, 2 years in the making, with one idea, to make the best psychedelic day time party tunes possible. Good times guaranteed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:949108e99b10a40acf981478972ef13e188c682c","amp;dn":"Killerwatts+-+Blow+Your+Mind+-+2012+%5Bpsychedelic+trance%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"949108e99b10a40acf981478972ef13e188c682c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,145,8,233,155,16,164,10,207,152,20,120,151,46,241,62,24,140,104,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
