Described by Saveur Magazine as a &quot;heartland cookbook icon,&quot; Fertig writes cookbooks that reflect her love of bread, baking, barbecue, and the fabulous foods of the Heartland.You can read some of her cookbooks like novels--the fabulously photographed Heartland, the award-winning and James Beard Awards-nominated Prairie Home Cooking (a &quot;tour de force,&quot; says Saveur), the encylopedic All-American Desserts, and Prairie Home Breads. Her IACP Cookbook Award-winning The Back in the Swing Cookbook (with Barbara C. Unell) takes you on a delicious daily journey to get you back in the swing after breast cancer. And some of her cookbooks just make you want to get in that kitchen and stir up something new--with one-bowl, no-knead bread in 200 Fast &amp; Easy Artisan Breads or with your &quot;electric assisant&quot; in The Artisan Bread Machine.\n\nKaren is President/Owner of Pig Out Publications, Inc. a wholesaler of BBQ &amp; grill cookbooks (over 275 titles). Adler is author of 13 cookbooks with 9 titles on the subject of barbecue. Her most recent book is Everything Wild Game Cookbook under the pseudonym of Karen Eagle. Karen's love for cooking began when she married her husband, Dick Adler. Dick is an avid sportsman and hunter. He and Karen hunt upland game birds; fly-fish for trout, and deep sea fish for the catch of the region. With a supply of wild game and fish in their two large freezers, Karen became an excellent game cook through trial and error and sharing recipes with other hunters and their wives. Adler's writing career includes articles in Barbecue Today, Hearth Patio &amp; BBQ Magazine, Cooking Pleasures, Great Grilling, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and Cooking Club of America/North American Group. She and Judith currently write a bi-monthly BBQ Queen column in Backyard Living magazine.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAcknowledgments ...5\nIntroduction ...6\nSpecialty Grilling Techniques ...8\nCHAPTER 1: Pantry ...10\nCHAPTER 2: Appetizers ...46\nCHAPTER 3: Sandwiches, Flatbreads &amp; Pizzas ...78\nCHAPTER 4: Soup &amp; Salad ...106\nCHAPTER 5: Meat, Poultry &amp; Fish ...134\nCHAPTER 6: Vegetable Sides ...158\nCHAPTER 7: Fruits &amp; Desserts ...186\nIndex ...214","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac0265551e88b1deae698bbfbf842046bc0585e","amp;dn":"The+Gardener+%26amp%3B+the+Grill+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac0265551e88b1deae698bbfbf842046bc0585e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,192,38,85,81,232,139,29,234,230,152,187,251,248,66,4,107,192,88,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
