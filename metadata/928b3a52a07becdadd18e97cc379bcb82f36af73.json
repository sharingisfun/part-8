The first part gives an account of the anatomy of the central nervous system, followed by a brief introduction to neurophysiology.\nThe second part is devoted to the dynamics of neuronal states, and demonstrates how very simple models may stimulate associative memory.\nThe third part of the book discusses models of learning, including detailed discussions on the limits of memory storage, methods of learning and their associated models, associativity, and error correction.\nThe final section of the book reviews possible applications of neural networks in artificial intelligence, expert systems, optimization problems, and the construction of actual neuronal supercomputers, with the potential for one-hundred fold increase in speed over contemporary serial machines.\n\n\nContents\nPreface\nAcknowledgments\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Mind as an emergent property of nervous systems\n1.2 Neuronal nets as automata networks: a brief historical overview\n1.3 Organization of the book\n2 The biology of neural networks: a few features for the sake of non-biologists\n2.1 Three approaches to the study of the functioning of central nervous systems\n2.2 The anatomy of central nervous systems\n2.3 A brief survey of neurophysiology\n2.4 Learning and memory: a summary of experimental observations\n3 The dynamics of neural networks: a stochastic approach\n3.1 Introducing the problem\n3.2 Noiseless neural networks\n3.3 Taking synaptic noise into account\n4 Hebbian models of associative memory\n4.1 Noiseless Hebbian models\n4.2 Stochastic Hebbian neural networks in the limit of finite numbers of memorized patterns\n4.3 Storing an infinite number of patterns in stochastic Hebbian networks: the technique of field distributions\n4.4 The replica method approach\n4.5 General dynamics of neural networks\n5 Temporal sequences of patterns\n5.1 Parallel dynamics\n52 tochastic dynamics\n5.3 An example of conditioned behavior\n6 The problem of learning in neural networks\n6.1 Introducing the problem\n6.2 Linear separability\n6.3 Computing the volume of solutions\n7 Learning dynamics in 'visible* neural networks\n7.1 A classification of learning dynamics\n7.2 Constraining the synaptic efficacies\n7.3 Projection algorithms\n7.4 The perceptron learning rules\n7.5 Correlated patterns\n8 Solving the problem of credit assignment\n8.1 The back-propagation algorithm\n8.2 Handling internal representations\n8.3 Learning in Boolean networks\n9 Self-organization\n9.1 Self-organization in simple networks\n9.2 Ontogenesis\n9.3 Three questions about learning\n10 Neurocomputat ion\n10.1 Domains of applications of neural networks\n10.2 Optimization\n10.3 Low-level signal processing\n10.4 Pattern matching\n10-5 Some speculations on biological systems 10.6 Higher associative functions\n11 Neurocomputers\n11.1 General principles of neurocomputation\n11.2 Semi-paxallel neurocomputers\n12 A critical view of the modeling of neural networks\n12.1 Information structures the biological system\n12.2 The neural code\n12.3 The synfire chains\n12.4 Computing with attractors versus computing with flows of information\n12.5 The issue of low neuronal activities\n12.6 Learning and cortical plasticity\n12.7 Taking the modular organization of the cortex into account\n12.8 Higher-order processing: the problem of artificial intelligence\n12.9 Concluding remarks\nReferences\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:928b3a52a07becdadd18e97cc379bcb82f36af73","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+the+Modeling+of+Neural+Networks+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"928b3a52a07becdadd18e97cc379bcb82f36af73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,139,58,82,160,123,236,218,221,24,233,124,195,121,188,184,47,54,175,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
