Chef Blackstock's traditional French cuisine with an eclectic flair is served at &quot;Le Chateau Anglais,&quot; a gourmet restaurant in the English countryside that is one of the few in the United Kingdom to receive a two-star rating from Michelin. The chef's quest for perfection and his lack of awareness about the costs of that perfection mean that the restaurant is on the brink of financial collapse when he and his wife Janice (played by Caroline Lee-Johnson) buy it early in the first series. The establishment mostly remains on that brink, despite Janice's best efforts as manager, eventually coming under the control of the boorish Cyril Bryson (Dave Hill) in the final series.\n\nAlthough focused on the restaurant's kitchen, the countryside (with its black market suppliers) and the Blackstocks' home life are also backdrops for the show; the chef's long hours mean that Janice is routinely neglected in the bedroom, and their plans for a family remain delayed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ce467b94fe1b6c66224aac4ef05819a56c1de3","amp;dn":"BBC++Comedy+-+Chef%21+%28.x264%29+Complete%2C+All+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ce467b94fe1b6c66224aac4ef05819a56c1de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,206,70,123,148,254,27,108,102,34,74,172,78,240,88,25,165,108,29,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
