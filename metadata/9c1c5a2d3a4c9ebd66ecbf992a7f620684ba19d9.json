The data collected and analyzed by scientists has revolutionized understanding of our neighbors. These efforts also captured the imagination of people from all backgrounds like nothing else except the Apollo lunar missions. Through a succession of analytical essays on major aspects of the history of robotic planetary exploration, this book opens new vistas in the understanding of the development of planetary science in the Space Age.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Palgrave Studies in the History of Science and Technology\nPDF: 393 pages\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan (January 8, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 113727316X\nISBN-13: 978-1137273161\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1c5a2d3a4c9ebd66ecbf992a7f620684ba19d9","amp;dn":"Exploring+the+Solar+System%3A+The+History+and+Science+of+Planetary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1c5a2d3a4c9ebd66ecbf992a7f620684ba19d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,28,90,45,58,76,158,189,102,236,191,153,42,127,98,6,132,186,25,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
