But the mastermind behind this job is none other than PopeyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old partner Macau Park, who escaped with 68kg of gold several years ago on their last job together. Macau Park brought Chinese thieves as well but little did they know what Macau Park planned for each one of them. His plan takes an unexpected turn when Popeye brings Pepsi, a genius safe-cracker and old flame of Macau Park, to settle the old score. The thievesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ target is a $20 million diamond known as Ã¢â‚¬ËœTear of the SunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, kept safely away in a casino, brought there to be sold by a notorious Chinese fence. While working together to steal this fabled diamond, they all have their own agenda to keep the diamond for themselves. But who will succeed and live to see another day?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d6954893accee3f02bb9ccc4c3112ac5679efc1","amp;dn":"The+Thieves+%282012%29+BluRay+1080p+5.1CH+x264+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d6954893accee3f02bb9ccc4c3112ac5679efc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,105,84,137,58,204,238,63,2,187,156,204,76,49,18,172,86,121,239,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
