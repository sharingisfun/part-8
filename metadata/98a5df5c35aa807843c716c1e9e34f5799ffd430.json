The label grew out of the Putumayo clothing company, founded by Dan Storper in 1975 and sold in 1997. \nIn the past ten years, Putumayo World Music has become known primarily for its upbeat and melodic compilations of great international music characterized by the company&amp;#039;s motto: ?guaranteed to make you feel good!? Putumayo?s CD covers feature the distinctive art of Nicola Heindl, whose colorful, folkloric style represents one of Putumayo&amp;#039;s goals: to connect the traditional to the contemporary. By combining appealing music and visuals with creative retail marketing, Putumayo has developed a unique brand identity - a rarity in today&amp;#039;s artist-based music industry. \n\n\nTracklist:\n01-Mary Black - Past the Point of Rescue.mp3\n02-John Steward - Irresistible Targets.mp3\n03-Indigo Girls - Hammer and a Nail.mp3\n04-Greg Trooper - Ireland.mp3\n05-Christine Lavin - Never Go Back.mp3\n06-John McCutcheon - Know When To Move.mp3\n07-Joan Baez - Play Me Backwards.mp3\n08-Dougie Maclean - Turning Away.mp3\n09-Kristen Hall - Out in the Country.mp3\n10-Greg Brown - Who Woulda Thunk It.mp3\n11-Catie Curtis - Mine Fields (From Years to Hours).mp3\n12-John Gorka - B.B.
