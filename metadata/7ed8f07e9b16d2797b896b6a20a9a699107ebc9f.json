This book is the result of Mr. Taylor's 30 year hands on experience as a vibration analyst. I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Taylor on several occasions. I attended all three of his week long seminars and let me tell you Mr. Taylor is the most knowledgeable vibration person I have ever met. This book is made up of 6 chapters and it is very well organized. To make a long story short, buy this book with confidence, it is worth every penny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed8f07e9b16d2797b896b6a20a9a699107ebc9f","amp;dn":"The+Vibration+Analysis+Handbook+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed8f07e9b16d2797b896b6a20a9a699107ebc9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,216,240,126,155,22,210,121,123,137,107,106,32,169,166,153,16,126,188,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
