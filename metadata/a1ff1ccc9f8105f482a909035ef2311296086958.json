But due to the studio's financial problems, Paramount Pictures paid additional funds to complete the film and released the movie in the U.S., with Orion retaining the international rights (these rights now belong to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer through their purchase of Orion). The film debuted in Los Angeles on November 16, 1991. It opened internationally on November 22, 1991 to generally good reviews.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ff1ccc9f8105f482a909035ef2311296086958","amp;dn":"The+Addams+Family+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ff1ccc9f8105f482a909035ef2311296086958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,255,28,204,159,129,5,244,130,169,9,3,94,242,49,18,150,8,105,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
