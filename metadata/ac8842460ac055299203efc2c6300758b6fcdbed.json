They were a continuation of the wars originally sparked off by the French Revolution of 1789 and threw Europe's armies into mobilization on an unprecedented scale.\r\nAugust 26, 1812 on the 124-km west of Moscow, in a field near the village of Borodino, two great armies fought final preparations for one of the bloodiest battles of the era. A quarter of a million people, more than a thousand guns. Here Borodino decided the fate of the entire campaign, the fate of Moscow, the fate of the whole of Russia.\r\n4-part project &quot;1812&quot; is a large-scale reconstruction of the 1812 war, the heroic events of the year in which Russia defeated Napoleon's France. The &quot;1812&quot; covers the main events of the war with Napoleon in the summer to the winter of 1812 - the moment when the &quot;great army&quot; invaded the Russian Empire, until the moment when its remnants were driven back.
