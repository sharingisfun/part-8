I will demonstrate |\r\n| not only the concept of these tactical chess manoeuvres but also the logic |\r\n| behind finding these moves in your own chess games. This course is broken |\r\n| down into 5 sections (one for each motif). In each section you will find |\r\n| 3-4 tutorials analysing different chess puzzles (the difficulty of the |\r\n| positions analysed in these puzzles increases as you go along). Also each |\r\n| section contains an analysis of a game played between two chess grand |\r\n| masters to demonstrate how effective these tactical manoeuvres can be and |\r\n| finally we prepared quizzes for you to practise and the end of each |\r\n| section","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba5bd4b74751cfb3d2e4978c93b08e10445d1058","amp;dn":"UDEMY+CHESS+STRATEGIES+LEARN+ATTACKING+TACTICAL+CHESS+MANEUVERS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba5bd4b74751cfb3d2e4978c93b08e10445d1058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,91,212,183,71,81,207,179,210,228,151,140,147,176,142,16,68,93,16,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
