Soon the military, religious leaders, thieves, and crackpots are trying to control the message on YouTube and on the streets. Meanwhile, the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political superpowers are considering a pre-emptive nuclear launch to eradicate the intruders. All that stands between 17 million anarchic residents and death is an alien ambassador, a biologist, a rapper, a soldier, and a myth that may be the size of a giant spider, or a god revealed.\n\n\nRead by Adjoa Andoh, Ben Onwukwe\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09120d96fa2a9f14cc9acb11db9251adee5a4cda","amp;dn":"Nnedi+Okorafor+-+Lagoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09120d96fa2a9f14cc9acb11db9251adee5a4cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,18,13,150,250,42,159,20,204,154,203,17,219,146,81,173,238,90,76,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
