Subsequently, they were assigned to other train operators and in 2012, five sets were refurbished by First Great Western. \n\nIn total, only 14 sets were built and despite their reliability problems, are still in operation today for Grand Central Trains, First Great Western and First Hull Trains. They are capable of reaching 125 mph (201 km/h) thanks to a Cummins QSK19 diesel engine, identical to the engine fitted to the Class 220 Ã¢â‚¬ËœVoyagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœAdelanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is also unique in being the only diesel-powered high speed train in the World that has a diesel-hydraulic transmission. \n\nThe Class 180 Ã¢â‚¬ËœAdelanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Train Simulator is available in Grand Central TrainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ black livery and includes features usually seen on high speed trains, including signal bell, open/close coupling hatch, DRA, instrument lights, glare panel, headlight control, vehicle overspeed, brake gauge, DSD reset pedal and working TMS system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:714f0c985434219bc2ff80a26d84dda61694e719","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015++Grand+Central+Class+180+%27Adelante%27+DMU+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"714f0c985434219bc2ff80a26d84dda61694e719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,79,12,152,84,52,33,155,194,255,128,162,109,132,221,166,22,148,231,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
