Blue deserves every accolade hoisted upon it. Had this been Mitchell's only album (and hallelujah it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t), induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame would have been assured. More importantly, through Blue, the emotions and honesty of Mitchell the singer, the writer and the musician are indelibly written on the soul of anyone who listens with an open heart. If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have this album, or if you do but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get it, you desperately need to.\n \nSelections:\n1) All I Want\n2) My Old Man\n3) Little Green\n4) Carey\n5) Blue\n6) California\n7) This Flight Tonight\n8) River\n9) A Case Of You\n10) The Last Time I Saw Richard\n \nMusicians:\nJoni Mitchell - Appalachian dulcimer, guitar, piano, vocals\nStephen Stills - Bass and guitar on &quot;Carey&quot;\nJames Taylor - Guitar on &quot;California&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;A Case of You&quot;\nSneaky Pete Kleinow - Pedal steel on &quot;California&quot;, &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot;\nRuss Kunkel - Drums on &quot;California&quot;, &quot;Carey&quot;, &quot;A Case of You&quot;\n\nThe setup used: \n-Technics SL-1900 direct drive turntable running an Ortofon Super OM-20 cartridge. \n-JVC AX-R97 integrated amp \n-Hoontech/Soundtrack Audio DSP24 Value sound card\n\nTechnical Specifications:\nThe signal was imported into Adobe Audition at 96kHz/32-bit (float).
