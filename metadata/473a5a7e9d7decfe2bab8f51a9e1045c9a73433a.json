Sono presenti anche alcune versione della canzone &quot;Shchedryk&quot;\n\nCarol of the Bells, conosciuta anche come Ukrainian Bell Carol, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ una celebre canzone natalizia, scritta nel 1936 dal compositore statunitense Peter Wilhousky (1902 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1978) e basata su una melodia del compositore ucraino Mykola Leontovyc (?????? ?????????; in russo: ??????? ?????????, Nikolaj Leontovic; 1877 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1921), intitolata Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â cedryk (&lt;Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡cedrykvka, che in lingua ucraina significa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCanto di CapodannoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) ed originalmente pensata per unÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢opera corale che fu rappresentata per la prima volta a Kiev nel 1916. Si tratta di un brano, che in Ucraina ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ tradizionalmente intonata la sera del 12 gennaio, vigilia del Capodanno (in lingua ucraina: Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â cedryj vecir) giuliano. \nIl testo di Peter Wilhousky, che si compone di sette strofe, parla della gioia nellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ascoltare il suono delle campane il giorno di Natale. \nIl testo originale ucraino non parla del periodo natalizio. Fa invece riferimento al vecchio Capodanno, che si svolgeva in primavera e parla di una rondine che va a far visita ad una famiglia contadina, augurando un anno prospero. \nfonte:   Visit this link: http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_of_the_Bells\n\nShchedryk (from the Ukrainian word shchedryy; &quot;bountiful&quot;) is a Ukrainian shchedrivka, or New Year's carol. It was arranged by composer and school teacher Mykola Leontovych in 1916, and tells a story of a swallow flying into a household to sing of wealth that will come with the following spring. Shchedryk was originally sung on the night of January 13 (Old Style), which is Shchedry Vechir (Ukrainian: ?????? ???i?, 'Bountiful Evening') to Ukrainians, New Year's Eve by the Julian Calendar.\nShchedryk was later adapted to an English Christmas carol, Carol of the Bells, by Peter J. Wilhousky following a performance of the original song by the Ukrainian National Chorus at Carnegie Hall on October 5, 1921. Wilhousky copyrighted and published his new lyrics (which were not based on the Ukrainian lyrics) in 1936, and the song became popular in the United States, where it became strongly associated with Christmas.\nOrigins and translation\nThe song is based on a traditional folk chant whose language was thought to have magical properties. The original traditional Ukrainian text used a device known as hemiola in the rhythm (alternating the accents within each measure from 3/4 to 6/8 and back again). The chant based on an ostinato 4 note pattern within the range of a minor third is thought to be of prehistoric origins and was associated with the coming New Year which in Ukraine before the introduction of Christianity was originally celebrated in April.\nWith the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine, the celebration of the New Year was moved from April to January and the holiday the chant describes became associated with the Feast of Epiphany also known in Ukrainian as Shchedry vechir. The songs sung for this celebration are known as Schedrivky.\nThe original Ukrainian text tells the tale of a swallow flying into a household to proclaim the plentiful and bountiful year that the family will have.&quot;The title is derived from the Ukrainian word for &quot;bountiful.&quot;\nIn Ukraine, the carol is currently sung on the eve of the Julian New Year (January 13th).\nThe 4 note melody over a minor 3rd of the chant was used by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych as an ostinato theme in a number of arrangements he made. The arrangement for mixed voice choir a cappella was popularized by the Ukrainian Republic Capella directed by Oleksander Koshetz when it toured the West after 1920.\nThe first of the English language lyrics below were written in 1936 by Peter Wilhousky of NBC Radio. The song reminded Wilhousky of beautiful ringing bells and he captured that imagery in his lyrics.\nfonte:   Visit this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shchedryk (allo stesso indirizzo sono presenti il testo di &quot;Shchedryk&quot;, la sua traslitterazione, la traduzione in inglese e il testo di &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;)\n\n\n\n[::Tracklist::]\nAbney Park - Carol of the Bells\nAl Di Meola - Carol of the Bells\nAngels of Venice - Carol of the Bells\nArcanta - Carol of the Bells\nBarenaked Ladies - Carol of the Bells\nBarking Dogs &amp; Jingle Cats - Carol of the Bells\nBoston Pops - Carol of the Bells\nBoys Choir of Harlem - Carol of the Bells\nBrad White &amp; Pierre Grill - Carol of the Bells\nBrooklyn Tabernacle Choir - Carol of The Bells\nCalifornia Guitar Trio - Carol of the Bells\nCanadian Brass - Carol of the Bells\nCeltic Woman - Carol of the Bells\nCharlie Byrd &amp; Washington Guitar Quintet - Carol of the Bells\nCheremshyna Ensemble - Shchedryk (Carol of the Bells)\nChoir Irkutsk University - Schedryk\nCody Kilby - Carol of the Bells\nColumbia Boys Choir - Carol of  the Bells\nDanny Wright - Carol of the Bells\nDavid Benoit - Carol of the Bells\nDavid Foster - Carol of the Bells\nDeana Carter - Carol of the Bells\nDestiny's Child - Opera of the Bells\nDianne Reeves - Carol of the Bells\nDonal Hinley - Carol of the Bells\nDurbin Elf - Carol of the Bells\nFleming &amp; John - Carol of the Bells\nGeorge Winston - Carol of the Bells\nHarry Connick Jr. - Carol of the Bells\nJohn Tesh Project - Carol of the Bells\nJohn Williams - Carol of the Bells\nJohnny Mathis - Carol of the Bells\nKenny Rogers - Carol Of The Bells\nKiev Chamber Choir - Shchedryk\nKrypteria -  Carol of the Bells\nLa petite Bande de MontrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©al - Carol of the bells\nMancow - Carol of the Bells(parody)\nMannheim Steamroller - Carol of the Bells\nMary Mary - Carol of the Bells\nMitya Kuznetsov - Schedryk\nMoya Brennan - Carol of the Bells\nNancy Wilson - Carol of the Bells\nNew World Orchestra - Carol of the Bells\nNew York Philharmonic - Carol of the Bells\nNSync - Carol of the Bells\nPatty Loveless - Carol Of The Bells\nPaul Horn - Carol of the Bells\nPoint of Grace - Carol Of The Bells\nRobert Shaw Chorale - Carol of the Bells\nShchedryk\nSouth Park - Carol of the Bells\nSpencer Brewer - Ukrainian Carol (Carol of the Bells)\nSteve Lukather - Carol of the Bells\nThe Carpenters - Carol of the Bells\nThe Countdown Kids - Carol of the Bells\nThe Four Seasons - Carol of the Bells\nThe Klezmonauts - Carol of the Bells\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir - Carol of the Bells\nThe Mormon Tabernacle Choir - Carol of the Bells (version 1)\nThe Nylons - Carol of the Bells\nThe St. Olaf Choir - Carol of the Bells\nTrans-Siberian Orchestra &amp; Metallica - Carol of the Bells(long)\nUkrainian Bandurist Chorus - Shchedryk (Carol of the Bells)\nUndina - Shchedryk (Carol of the Bells)\nUnknown A Capella A - Carol of the Bells\nUnknown A Capella B - Carol of the Bells\nUnknown A Capella Women - Carol of the Bells(Home Alone Soundtrack)\nUnknown Hammered Dulcimer &amp; Flute - Carol of the Bells\nUnknown Handbells - Carol of the Bells\nUnnamed Artists (Coca Cola) - Carol Of The Bells\nVienna Boys Choir - Carol of the Bells\nWilliam Wilde Zeitler - Carol of the Bells\nWindham Hill Artists - Carol of the Bells\nWynton Marsalis - Carol of the Bells\n\n\n[::Dati Tecnici::]\nBitrate Vario\n\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:473a5a7e9d7decfe2bab8f51a9e1045c9a73433a","amp;dn":"Carol+of+the+Bells+%5BLossy+Mp3+Various+Bitrate%5D+Artisti+Vari+%5BTnt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"473a5a7e9d7decfe2bab8f51a9e1045c9a73433a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,58,90,126,157,125,236,254,43,171,143,81,169,225,4,92,154,115,67,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
