Frank is the elder of the two and Joe is two years younger. The two boys live in the fictional city of Bayport, New York with their famous father, Fenton Hardy (Ed Gilbert), a private detective formerly with the New York Police Department.\n\nIn addition to the Hardy Boys, their stories feature two other characters with some regularity: Aunt Gertrude (Edith Atwater) and a platonic female friend of the boys, Callie Shaw (Lisa Eilbacher), who also does part-time work for their father, Fenton. Other characters which played a major part of the Hardy Boys books, such as Chet Morton (Gary Springer), appeared only briefly in the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82bdf690ae4d2d178de6df7dbc82fd881071b2c8","amp;dn":"The+Hardy+Boys%2FNancy+Drew+Mysteries+-+All+3+Seasons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82bdf690ae4d2d178de6df7dbc82fd881071b2c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,189,246,144,174,77,45,23,141,230,223,125,188,130,253,136,16,113,178,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
