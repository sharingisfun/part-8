There is no doubt that, unlike scientists and engineers of the past, technology leaders of the future will have to rely on quantum mechanics in their everyday work. This makes teaching and learning the subject of paramount importance for further progress. Mastering quantum physics is a very non-trivial task and its deep understanding can only be achieved through working out real-life problems and examples. It is notoriously difficult to come up with new quantum-mechanical problems that would be solvable with a pencil and paper, and within a finite amount of time. This book remarkably presents some 700+ original problems in quantum mechanics together with detailed solutions covering nearly 1000 pages on all aspects of quantum science. The material is largely new to the English-speaking audience. \nThe problems have been collected over about 60 years, first by the lead author, the late Prof. Victor Galitski, Sr. Over the years, new problems were added and the material polished by Prof. Boris Karnakov. Finally, Prof. Victor Galitski, Jr., has extended the material with new problems particularly relevant to modern science.\nAbout the Authors:\nVictor Galitski, Sr, (1924 - 1981) in the course of his 30-year long research career in theoretical physics, co-authored 77 papers in an amazing variety of fields of both nuclear physics and condensed matter physics. His famous results include the derivation of what now is called the Galitski-Feynman equations, the first theory of unconventional superconductivity, and the development of diagrammatic calculation methods in condensed matter physics. From 1961 until his death in 1981, Victor Galitski, Sr, was the head of the Theoretical Physics Department at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. From 1972 to 1981 he also was the director of the Nuclear Physics Department at the Kurchatov Institute for Atomic Energy in Moscow.\n\nDr. Boris Karnakov is a Professor Emeritus at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. His research interests include nuclear physics, where he has more than 50 publications.\n\nDr. Vladimir Kogan is a Professor Emeritus at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. His interests are primarily physics education and quantum mechanics. He was the co-author of the first edition of a much shorter problems and solutions book published jointly with Victor Galitski, Sr, in 1956.\n\nDr. Victor Galitski, Jr, is a grandson of the first author of the book. His research interests include various aspects of theoretical condensed matter physics and cold atoms, with the focus on superconductivity, topological phases of matter, and spin transport. Galitski, Jr, is currently an Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. He is a Fellow of the Joint Quantum Institute and a member of the Center of Nanophysics and Advanced Materials there. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17e1c5ec14a54a025a12264c55d53039508cd30","amp;dn":"Exploring+Quantum+Mechanics-+Galitski+2013+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17e1c5ec14a54a025a12264c55d53039508cd30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,126,28,94,193,74,84,160,37,161,34,100,197,93,83,3,149,8,205,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
