Gone was the doe-eyed Hackney girl, who could summon bunnies and birds with her Disney Princess falsetto and in came the darker, more profound side to X Factor's voice of an angel. If lead single 'Trouble' told us anything it's that she's back cantillating her woes of heartbreak once again; and she's nowhere as innocent as we all first thought.\n\nWe all know by now that Leona's biggest asset is her ability to melt-hearts over a string-led ballad, but on her third album Glassheart it's the pacey numbers full of angst and torment that standout. &quot;I don't mind the pain,&quot; she confesses on 'Come Alive' over rumbling synths and breakbeats, while she purposefully goads her ex on 'Shake You Up'; a slice of strutting '80s handbag pop that features a welcome return of the xylophone to the charts.\n\nWhat's more, the ironic wedding bells riff on reggae-tinged 'Favourite Scar' underlies the diva confessing her love in a messed up relationship, while hard-hitting dubstep drops grate against Leona's fear that her beau is about to break her heart on the title track (&quot;You're about to tear this love apart.&quot;) Even the ethereal vibe of 'Fireflies', which is both uplifting and goosebump-inducing, hears the star lamenting over life's wonders.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some of Leona's finest moments on the record are in the more sombre warblers. 'Un Love Me' is flecked with delicate piano and big vocals, while 'Fingerprint' is an understated, heart-tingling ballad, which allows her world-famous falsetto let loose to tell all about an irreplaceable loved-one. Like many artists before her, Leona has channelled the darker side of love's grasp into her work - and the result is nothing short of spectacular.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1d96d81147b819b51707fae5855eed54fc93ac","amp;dn":"Leona+Lewis+-+Glassheart+-+2012+Album+%28+iTunes+Versions+%29++WEB++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1d96d81147b819b51707fae5855eed54fc93ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,29,150,216,17,71,184,25,181,23,7,250,229,133,94,237,84,252,147,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
