The most recent run saw Kemp examine the conflicts in Northern Ireland, poverty and corruption in Las Vegas the crack epidemic in Rio de Janeiro and India's huge sex-trafficking industry\n\n\n1)  India \nThe actor and his documentary team expose stories of crime and hardship around the world, beginning with sex trafficking in India. Ross visits the notorious red-light district of Mumbai, where secretly filmed footage reveals not only the scale of the industry but how young some of the girls trapped in it are. He also travels across country to West Bengal, meeting families whose daughters have been taken from them, and comes face to face with a sex trafficker who confesses to many shocking acts that leave the presenter and his team stunned.\n\n2)  Papua New Guinea \nRoss Kemp and his team visit Papua New Guinea, one of the most diverse yet chaotic nations on earth. Beginning his journey in the capital, Port Moresby, where gangs control the streets and armed robberies, car-jackings and rape are commonplace, the actor soon realises that life is dictated by tribal custom. But when he travels into the highlands along one of the world's most dangerous roads, where an estimated 400 people are murdered every year, Ross finds himself held at gunpoint by hijackers.\n\n3)  Northern Ireland \nRoss travels to Northern Ireland to find that, more than 15 years after the Good Friday peace agreement, the country is still deeply divided. Setting out to discover what makes people on both sides unwilling to let go of the past, he meets taxi drivers who offer tours of the sites of the Troubles, sees the towering `peace walls' that keep the different communities apart and witnesses a peak in the violence during the July marching season. He also accompanies the police to see how they try to keep the peace as the bottles and bricks rain down on the first of four nights of protest.\n\n4)  Lebanon \nRoss visits the Middle East, where Lebanon is on the brink of civil war. In Tripoli, Sunni Muslims are fighting Shia Muslim Alawites in a battle that mirrors the war in neighbouring Syria. Their frontline is a mile-long street, the buildings on each side riddled with bullet holes and RPG explosions. Ross visits both sides of the conflict, spending time with the fighters and those caught in the crossfire.\n\n5)  Las Vegas \nRoss Kemp ventures behind the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas, a non-stop party town where last year 40 million visitors spent Ã‚Â£15billion, discovering that the strip is far from fun for some, not helped by the recession of 2008, which plunged many people into unemployment and bankruptcy. Ross meets some of the homeless who live in the city's storm drains, hears stories of drug and gambling addiction and talks to police officers, gang members and criminals who reveal how Las Vegas is a city where extreme wealth and poverty sit side by side.\n\n6)  Rio de Janeiro \nRoss investigates the drug epidemic sweeping through Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has the seventh largest economy in the world but despite this new-found wealth it is the largest consumer of crack cocaine anywhere on the planet. Ross witnesses dealers, for whom selling crack is a 24-hour operation and who openly carry weapons in case police mount a raid. In the dens he discovers the human tragedy of the crisis, meeting those trapped in a cycle of addiction, slaves to a drug that destroys jobs, relationships and lives.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9544/yqlr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/9544/yqlr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/4835/21qa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/4835/21qa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/2396/zqyr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/2396/zqyr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7835/xw1d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/7835/xw1d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/7452/3zfl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/7452/3zfl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/7110/uyhi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/7110/uyhi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/1633/11vo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img38.imageshack.us/img38/1633/11vo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/2512/uxhg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/2512/uxhg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/9150/3m1l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/9150/3m1l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2356/o4q9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2356/o4q9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/6990/y2xf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/6990/y2xf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4196/dl58.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4196/dl58.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0f476668674f433b213e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2959 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 974 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kemp:_Extreme_World&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kemp:_Extreme_World&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Extreme%20World%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Extreme%20World%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Extreme%20World%20Season%202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Extreme%20World%20Season%202&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4791b0cf3653fd2e079b0c1768fe0d35558b13a6","amp;dn":"Ross+Kemp+Extreme+World+Series+3+6of6+Rio+de+Janeiro+720p+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4791b0cf3653fd2e079b0c1768fe0d35558b13a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,145,176,207,54,83,253,46,7,155,12,23,104,254,13,53,85,139,19,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
