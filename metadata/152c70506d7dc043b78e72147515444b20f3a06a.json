For the Idol-watching rock fan's money, nobody--not even\nSouthern-fried heartthrob Bo Bice in season four--stormed the stage with more raw\ntalent. That it translates so well to a solo disc (Daughtry was recorded with studio musicians; future discs will include a Daughtry-assembled band) proves all he needed was a little prodding, the kind the tube has gotten so good at. Here are a dozen songs that'll flick your rock &amp; roll switch, whether you're a Creed fan, a club kid, or a mambo king: &quot;Used To&quot; and &quot;Over You,&quot; a couple of early tracks, ought to arrive bundled with a road map they're so highway sing-along-ready, and &quot;Feels Like Tonight&quot; screws the lid on the premise that Daughtry can deliver a punchy pop-rock song without flinching. Elsewhere, the North Carolina family man lets his inner (and outer,actually) goatee- and eyeline r-type guy rip: his built-for-the-hard-stuff voice bites down appealingly on &quot;Breakdown,&quot; a dark serenade to mental health, and also on &quot;What I Want,&quot; an '80s-style fist-pumper featuring Slash. The loud mad dash of those songs leads to a midtempo wind-down (&quot;All These Lives,&quot; &quot;What About Now&quot;), but as a mix, it  works. Daughtry is a man of many moods--contemplative, explosive, insistent, humble. No matter which pokes through on a given song, he steadies it to a place as honest as it is accessible. Rare is the rocker who lays out so broad an on-ramp. --Tammy La Gorce\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.It's not over                                        [03:35]\n02.Used to                                              [03:32]\n03.Home                                                 [04:16]\n04.Over you                                             [03:27]\n05.Crashed                                              [03:32]\n06.Feels like tonight                                   [04:02]\n07.What I want                                          [02:49]\n08.Breakdown                                            [04:02]\n09.Gone                                                 [03:22]\n10.There and back again                                 [03:16]\n11.All these lives                                      [03:24]\n12.What about now                                       [04:11]\n________\n43:28 min\n 72,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
