Instead of Bossa Nova and uptown Rio de Janeiro, Hirszman's interest turn to Brazilian popular music's roots. As a result we have a beautiful and pungent record of Nelson Cavaquinho in his environment, talking to friends and neighbors, in his house or in the bar. \n\nFile Name .........................................: [1969] Nelson Cavaquinho - Leon Hirszman.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 206,145,536 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 14:32.031\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1802 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.245 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 76 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
