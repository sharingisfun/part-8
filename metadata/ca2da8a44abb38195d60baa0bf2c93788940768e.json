When the professor announces his intention to donate the &quot;Vampisol&quot; formula free of charge to vampires all over the world, the Vampires from Dusseldorf Germany try to muscle in and steal the formula. The action escalates and other monsters and our hero with his girlfriend are all caught up in the chase.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2da8a44abb38195d60baa0bf2c93788940768e","amp;dn":"Vampiros+en+la+Habana","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2da8a44abb38195d60baa0bf2c93788940768e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,45,168,164,74,187,56,25,93,96,186,160,191,44,147,120,137,64,118,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
