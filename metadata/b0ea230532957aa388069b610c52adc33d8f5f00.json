The ambling shakiness of the first set puts this into the category of simply average-caliber fare from Garcia and friends. Die-hard completist Deadheads and those who prefer the bluesier side of GarciaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multifaceted playing might take interest, but the casual listener might find this set falling short of inspired, even for the fun-loving vibe that develops as it goes on.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ea230532957aa388069b610c52adc33d8f5f00","amp;dn":"Jerry+Garcia+Band+-+Garcia+Live+Vol+5+Keystone+Berkeley+%282014%29+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ea230532957aa388069b610c52adc33d8f5f00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,234,35,5,50,149,122,163,136,6,155,97,12,82,173,195,61,143,95,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
