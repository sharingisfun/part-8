Collins\nCountry: United States\nLanguage: English\nSubject: Management &amp; Leadership\nGenre: Business\nAverage Customer Review: 4.4 out of 5 stars \n\n\nGood to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't is a 2001 management book by James C. Collins that aims to describe how companies transition from being average companies to great companies and how companies can fail to make the transition. &quot;Greatness&quot; is defined as financial performance several multiples better than the market average over a sustained period. Collins finds the main factor for achieving the transition to be a narrow focusing of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resources on their field of competence.\n\nThe book was a massive best-seller, selling four million copies and going far beyond the traditional audience of business books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb308346350d1f6ca61561e4ef68e08f5de5543","amp;dn":"Jim+Collins+-+Good+to+Great","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb308346350d1f6ca61561e4ef68e08f5de5543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,179,8,52,99,80,209,246,202,97,86,30,78,246,142,8,245,222,85,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
