Visiting Uganda, America, Russia, Brazil and India, Stephen encounters some of the most notorious homophobes on the planet to try to understand the origin of their beliefs; he also meets victims of homophobic abuse.\nStephen Fry Out There was co-produced with the Open University.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nIn the first of this two-part series, Stephen Fry reflects back on just how much has changed for gay people during his lifetime. He meets Elton John and David Furnish, the couple who inspired Stephen to be open about his sexuality as well as many others. This episode, Stephen travels to Uganda, where the government is considering a new law that would make homosexuality a capital crime - putting gay people to death for their sexuality. Stephen meets the men and women targeted by this proposed law and finds out the impact it is already having on their lives. Stephen also travels to the USA to explore 'reparative therapy', which claims to offer a 'cure' for being gay. Whilst in the states, he looks at how Hollywood deals with the gay issue by talking to Neil Patrick Harris, an openly gay man who continues to land leading roles.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThis episode sees Stephen visit Brazil, home to the largest gay pride celebration in the world and a place that has some of the best legislation on the planet for gay equality. But it has come at a price. All of the advances have brought about a violent backlash against gay people; on average, one gay person is murdered every 36 hours in Brazil. Stephen sees how this is impacting on the lives of gay men and women there and also confronts the politician leading the fight against gay rights. Stephen also visits Russia, where gays are now worse off than they have been for a long time. Their rights are being constantly eroded by a conservative government, backed by the disapproval of the Russian Orthodox Church. Stephen then travels to India, where the old British laws that criminalised homosexuality have just been overturned. Modern India is now looking to Hindu traditions as it forges a more positive way forward for its gay citizens, including its once celebrated transgender community.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/8266/l9vp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/8266/l9vp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/4206/k1xr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/4206/k1xr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/4500/7mx9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/4500/7mx9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3049/8vtq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3049/8vtq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8490/6zxu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/8490/6zxu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2233/jjdo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2233/jjdo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9120/4wge.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9120/4wge.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5954/zs5p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5954/zs5p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/3434/fnjy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/3434/fnjy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;145c7d737c5458273a24&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1507 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832x468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: average 689 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles \n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01fttn0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01fttn0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=American%20Transgender&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=American%20Transgender&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Me%20My%20Sex%20And%20I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Me%20My%20Sex%20And%20I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=For%20The%20Bible%20Tells%20Me%20So&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=For%20The%20Bible%20Tells%20Me%20So&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Sex%20Researchers%3A%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Sex%20Researchers%3A%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f11a34e226b43cf7037c14bcdc36722b5cd8e0","amp;dn":"BBC+Stephen+Fry+Out+There+1of2+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f11a34e226b43cf7037c14bcdc36722b5cd8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,241,26,52,226,38,180,60,247,3,124,20,188,220,54,114,43,92,216,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
