Throughout the 1970s and raging into the 1980s, the band grew a tidal wave of followers and produced such hit songs as &quot;Limelight,&quot; &quot;Subdivisions,&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer.&quot; Inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013, this progressive rock, hard rock, and heavy metal band is destined to go down in history as legendary. The band continues to make history today.\r\n\r\nRush: The Illustrated History is a fully updated, richly illustrated history from prolific rock journalist and noted Rush authority Martin Popoff. The book follows the world-conquering exploits of Rush band members Geddy Lee, Neil Peart, and Alex Lifeson from the band's formation in Toronto to their fortieth anniversary celebration and tour. Popoff's stellar history is complemented by LP reviews from a slate of highly regarded music writers, a thorough discography compiled by the author himself, and more than 400 photographs and articles of memorabilia, from candid backstage images and live performance photography to picture sleeves, gig posters, period print ads, ticket stubs, backstage passes, and more. The result is a visually stunning and authoritative review befitting the rock band with one of the most devoted fan bases ever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:242531336a1c246a6dae5136d8159b5f28707c8a","amp;dn":"Rush+-+The+Unofficial+Illustrated+History+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"242531336a1c246a6dae5136d8159b5f28707c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,37,49,51,106,28,36,106,109,174,81,54,216,21,155,95,40,112,124,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
