When Del was interviewed for Grateful Web last year he explained that though he is thrilled that bluegrass is bigger today than it was back in the 40s and 50s, that nothing could replace that 50,000 watt clear channel radio station that aired performances from the Grand OleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Opry. DelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music with his sons and nephews has brought legions of newer fans to appreciate and understand what the untainted form sounds like: little amplification, a couple of microphones, and a five-part harmony. His last two releases were more focused on collaboration (American Legacies with the Preservation Hall Band) and homage (Old Memories, A tribute to the music of Bill Monroe.) The latest brings Del back to his humble beginnings in Baltimore, Maryland, years before he would join Bill MonroeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bluegrass Boys where his fame arose. In particular, Del remembers fondly the Broadway of Baltimore and the music that brought him up. Once again, McCoury reveals that bluegrass was and still is coupled with country music and builds his project from covers and new tunes that embrace those fundamental elements.\n\nDel builds his song list not from who first played which tune, but which rendition he adored most. For example, he channeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“MistyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a now traditional) tune through country singer Ray Stevens rendition. This was the music surrounding him in those early days. The country/rock crossover hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Too Many RiversÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be known by country fans through Bobby Bare and soul fans by Brenda Lee. As usual, Del embraces humor as a staple of bluegrass. Ã¢â‚¬Å“AmnesiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a hilarious recollection of all the great things I ever did for you, and if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recall, they outta treat ya. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Need More TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a meandering lament co-penned by Jerry Salley. McCouryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are never sweeter. Breaking form for the waltz Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Wanna Go Where You GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the band, especially fiddle-man Jason Carter and mandolin player Ronnie McCoury whose lingering notations weave into a rhythm with DelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s near whisper. I am unsure about how many if any of these tunes have been performed live by the McCouryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for years. Their confidence level leads me to believe many of these could already be staples of the McCoury repertoire. The title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Streets of BaltimoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is undoubtedly a Del original. A telling of a young country girl who made her way to the Streets of Baltimore to make it in show business. Del quipped Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back then, you could get anything you needed down there, and a lot of things you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need too!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4cf3b2a24464c17aa08eef4667e620cd6c0fb1","amp;dn":"The+Del+McCoury+Band+-+The+Streets+of+Baltimore+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Cc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4cf3b2a24464c17aa08eef4667e620cd6c0fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,76,243,178,162,68,100,193,122,160,142,239,70,103,230,32,205,108,15,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
