Dire Straits' &quot;best of&quot; albums are all good, but they share many of the same songs. If you want to avoid having multiple copies of songs you have to look at the differences between these compilation albums. My preference was Money for Nothing because it has a balanced sampling of songs from the first five albums (it was released before the 6th album, On Every Street, so doesn't have any tracks from that album). On the other hand, the Sultans of Swing and Private Investigations compilations focus on the last four albums, especially Brothers in Arms, and almost completely ignore the first two albums. I think the first three albums are the group's best, so my nod to the Money for Nothing compilation was a no-brainer. It includes three early tracks...Down to the Waterline, Portobello Belle, and Where Do You Think You're Going...that don't appear on any of the other compilations. The album also has two live tracks, Portobello Belle and Telegraph Road, that are quite good.\n\nNotes: The album's Money for Nothing and Brothers in Arms tracks are edited versions, but the editing was smoothly done and does not in my opinion detract from the songs' integrity. What does irk me though, is that a different studio version of Where Do You Think You're Going was used, instead of the considerably better version from the Communique album.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDire Straits - Money for Nothing\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dire Straits\nAlbum................: Money for Nothing\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988 10\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 54 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Best Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 255kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
