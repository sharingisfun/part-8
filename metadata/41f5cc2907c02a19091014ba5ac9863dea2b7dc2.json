A freak accident propels Howard back to 1784, where he assumes the identity of one of his own ancestors. Howard falls in love with his distant cousin Helen (Heather Angel), while his other relatives regard the time-traveller as a &quot;sorcerer&quot; due to his disturbing knowledge of future events. Gradually, Howard is disillusioned by the squalor and bigotry of the 18th century. He bids farewell to Helen, explaining that he will actually be born years after her death but that they will be reunited &quot;in God's time&quot;. Returning to the present, Howard discovers that Helen died young without ever marrying. He renounces his own fiancee and determines to live out his life as a bachelor, to be united with his true love in death. Long considered a lost film, Berkeley Square was rediscovered in the mid 1970s. The film had already been remade in 1951 as the Tyrone Power vehicle I'll Never Forget You.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023794/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023794/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:26:31\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 592x448  4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1037 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 91 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f5cc2907c02a19091014ba5ac9863dea2b7dc2","amp;dn":"Berkeley+Square+%281933%29+Leslie+Howard+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f5cc2907c02a19091014ba5ac9863dea2b7dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,245,204,41,7,192,42,25,9,16,20,186,90,201,134,61,234,43,125,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
