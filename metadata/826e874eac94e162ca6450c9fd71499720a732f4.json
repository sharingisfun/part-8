Both albums are excellent hard country LPs, and this is a terrific way to pick them up, but consumers might want to seek out Raven's similar two-fer of Another Place Another Time/She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye, which contains the entirety of those two LPs, plus six of the 11 songs from She Still Comes Around. For fans who can only afford one two-fer of the Killer's best country albums, that's the way to go, but for collectors who want the albums in their entirety and do not want to invest in Bear Family's superb series of Jerry Lee's complete recordings, this is a good choice.
