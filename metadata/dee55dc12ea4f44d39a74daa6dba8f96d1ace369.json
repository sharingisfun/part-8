And if you have a programming background, you can get up and running with C# in as little as three hours using this course. Author Gerry O'Brien introduces C# and the Visual Studio IDE; the core language elements such as data types, variables, constants, functions, and loops; and object-oriented programming with classes and namespaces. Plus, learn how to handle exceptions with the try-catch-finally mechanism and manage memory resources. Then get a brief tour of two fully functional Windows Phone and Windows Store apps to see what the final results look like. There are also five challenge videos that allow you to test your C# prowess, and five matching videos where Gerry explains the correct solutions.\n\nTopics include:\nInstalling C#\nWorking with loops\nControlling program flow\nUsing variables\nBuilding functions\nCreating and instantiating classes\nCatching errors\nManaging resources with the garbage collector\nBuilding collections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee55dc12ea4f44d39a74daa6dba8f96d1ace369","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+C%23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee55dc12ea4f44d39a74daa6dba8f96d1ace369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,229,93,193,46,164,244,77,57,167,77,170,109,186,143,150,209,172,227,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
