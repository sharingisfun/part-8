Released in November 1970, it includes the hit singles &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot;, as well as songs such as &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; and the title track that were turned down by Harrison's former band, the Beatles. The album reflects the influence of his musical activities outside the Beatles during 1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ70 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with Bob Dylan, the Band, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Billy Preston and others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and Harrison's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The album introduced Harrison's signature sound, the slide guitar, and the spiritual themes that would be implicit throughout his subsequent solo work. The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams, titled Apple Jam, and it was the first studio triple album by a single act in the history of rock music. Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein's album cover photo, showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes, as a statement on his independence from the Beatles.  Production began at London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney &amp; Bonnie's Friends band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains unreleased.  All Things Must Pass was critically acclaimed on release and, with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world, commercially successful. The album was co-produced by Phil Spector and employs the latter's Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as &quot;Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons&quot;. Reflecting the general surprise at the assuredness of Harrison's post-Beatles debut, Melody Maker's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo's first role in a talking picture and declared: &quot;Garbo talks! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harrison is free!&quot; A number of music critics consider All Things Must Pass to be the best of all the Beatles' solo albums.[according to whom?]  In March 2001, following a successful reissue campaign coinciding with its 30th anniversary, the album was certified 6x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2012, Rolling Stone placed All Things Must Pass 433rd on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;..\n\n2001 Re-Issue - To mark the 30th anniversary of the album's release, Harrison supervised a remastered edition of All Things Must Pass, which was issued in January 2001, less than a year before his death from cancer at the age of 58. The reissue appeared on Gnome Records, a label specifically set up by him for the project. Harrison oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein's album artwork, which included a colorised &quot;George &amp; the Gnomes&quot; front cover and, on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet, further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary, gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape. The latter series served to illustrate Harrison's dismay at &quot;the direction the world seemed headed at the start of the millennium&quot;, biographer Gary Tillery observes, a direction that was &quot;so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties&quot;  The new version of the album contained five bonus tracks, including &quot;I Live For You&quot;, two of the songs performed for Spector at Abbey Road in May 1970 (&quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Let It Down&quot;) and &quot;My Sweet Lord (2000)&quot;, a partial re-recording of Harrison's biggest solo hit. In addition, Harrison resequenced the content of Apple Jam so that the album closed with &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, as he had originally intended. Assisting Harrison with overdubs on the bonus tracks were his son, Dhani Harrison, singer Sam Brown and percussionist Ray Cooper, all of whom contributed to the recording of Brainwashed around this time.  With Harrison &quot;[throwing] himself wholeheartedly&quot; into promotional work, the 2001 reissue was a critical and commercial success. In America, the reissue debuted at number 4 on Billboard's Top Pop Catalog Albums chart and topped the magazine's Internet Album Sales listings; in the UK, it climbed to number 68 on the national albums chart. Following Harrison's death on 29 November 2001, All Things Must Pass returned to the US charts, climbing to number 6 and number 7, respectively, on the Top Pop Catalog and Internet Album Sales charts. In October 2007, it re-entered the US Top Pop Catalog chart once more and peaked at number 3\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] I'd Have You Anytime\n[02] My Sweet Lord\n[03] Wah-Wah\n[04] Isn't It A Pity\n[05] What Is Life\n[06] If Not For You\n[07] Behind That Locked Door\n[08] Let It Down\n[09] Run Of The Mill\n[10] I Live For You (Bonus)\n[11] Beware Of Darkness (Bonus)\n[12] Let It Down (Bonus)\n[13] What Is Life (Bonus)\n[14] My Sweet Lord (2000) (Bonus)\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:59m:56s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Beware Of Darkness\n[02] Apple Scruffs\n[03] Ballad Of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\n[04] Awaiting On You All\n[05] All Things Must Pass\n[06] I Dig Love\n[07] Art Of Dying\n[08] Isn't It A Pity (Version Two)\n[09] Hear Me Lord\n[10] It's Johnny's Birthday (Bonus)\n[11] Plug Me In (Bonus)\n[12] I Remember Jeep (Bonus)\n[13] Thanks For The Pepperoni (Bonus)\n[14] Out Of The Blue (Bonus)\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 01h:06m:09s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:06m:05s\nTotal File Size....................... mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
