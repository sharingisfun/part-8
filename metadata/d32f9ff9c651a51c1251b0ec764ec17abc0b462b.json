ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chicken from western Goa cooked in garlic, onion, and a splash of vinegar; from Bombay, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s with apricots; from Delhi, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stewed with spinach and cardamom; from eastern India, it has yogurt and cinnamon; and from the south, mustard, curry leaves, and coconut.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ There is a wide range of dishes for lamb, pork, and beef with important tips on what cuts to use for curries, kebabs, and braises.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ There are vegetable dishes, in a tempting arrayÃ¢â‚¬â€from everyday carrots and greens in new dress to intriguing ways with eggplant and okraÃ¢â‚¬â€served center stage for vegetarians or as accompaniments.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ At the heart of so many Indian meals are the dals, rice, and grains, as well as the little salads, chutneys, and pickles that add sparkle, and Jaffrey opens up a new world of these simple pleasures.\n\nThroughout, Madhur JaffreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knowledge of and love of these foods is contagious. Here are the dishes she grew up on in India and then shared with her own family and friends in America. And now that she has made them so accessible to us, we can incorporate them confidently into our own kitchen, and enjoy the spice and variety and health-giving properties of this delectable cuisine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32f9ff9c651a51c1251b0ec764ec17abc0b462b","amp;dn":"At+Home+with+Madhur+Jaffrey+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32f9ff9c651a51c1251b0ec764ec17abc0b462b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,47,159,249,198,81,165,28,18,81,176,236,118,78,193,122,188,11,70,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
