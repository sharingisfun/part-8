New and important trends are\ndiscussed including probabilistic safety analysis (PSA), deregulation\nof the electric power industry to permit competition in the supply of\nelectricity; improvements in performance characteristics of nuclear\npower plants, such as capacity factor, production costs, and safety\nfactors; storage and disposal of all types of radioactive wastes;\nadvances in decontamination, decommissioning and reutilization;\ncontinued progress in evolutionary reactors; increased interest\nin the role of nuclear power in reducing pollution and global\nwarming. Attention will also be given to the developments in\nsuch countries as Russia, Ukraine, France, Sweden, South Korea,\nChina and Third World Countries.\n\nNuclear Energy: An Introduction to the Concepts,\nSystems, and Applications of Nuclear Processes\nBy: Raymond L.
