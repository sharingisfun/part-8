One hundred perfumes and scents in all their fragrant glory reveal a fascinating social history of the past century. From the belle epoque through the swinging sixties, to the naughty nineties and beyond, Ostrom brings intelligence and wit to this most ravishing of subjects.\r\n\r\nThere was the patriotic impact of English Lavender during World War I and perfumes that captured the Egyptomania of the 1920's. Estee Lauder created &quot;Youth Dew&quot; and with it, distilled the essence of 1950's suburbia. Patchouli Oilâ€•the &quot;anti-perfume&quot; of the 1960sâ€•was sure to keep money out of the hands of corporations and &quot;the man.&quot; And who could forget the fervor created by the grunge androgyny of CK One? Scent is truly the passport to memory, making Perfume both a lush treat and an insightful examination of the twentieth century through the most mysterious of the five sense.\r\nB&amp;W Illustrations throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ee71718f79dc7f01e16063e8c9979a7e4ee53f4","amp;dn":"Perfume+-+A+Century+of+Scents+-+1st+Edition+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ee71718f79dc7f01e16063e8c9979a7e4ee53f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,231,23,24,247,157,199,240,30,22,6,62,140,153,121,167,228,238,83,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
