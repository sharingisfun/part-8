The founding members of the Ramblers, or NLCR, are Mike Seeger, John Cohen, and Tom Paley. Paley left the group in 1962 and was replaced by Tracy Schwarz.\n\nThe New Lost City Ramblers not only directly participated in the old-time music revival, but has continued to directly influence countless musicians who have followed.\n\nThe Ramblers distinguished themselves by focusing on the traditional playing styles they heard on old 78rpm records of musicians recorded during the 1920s and 1930s, many of whom had earlier appeared on the Anthology of American Folk Music. The New Lost City Ramblers refused to &quot;sanitize&quot; these southern sounds as did other folk groups of the time, such as the Weavers or Kingston Trio. Instead, the Ramblers have always strived for an authentic sound.[ However, the Ramblers did not merely copy the old recordings that inspired them. Rather, they would use the various old-time styles they encountered while at the same time not becoming slaves to imitation.\n\nOn Songs From the Depression, the New Lost City Ramblers performed a variety of political contemporary popular songs from the New Deal days, all but one of them taken from commercially issued 78s, and that one is &quot;Keep Moving,&quot; identified in the album notes only as &quot;from Tony Schwartz' collection Ã¢â‚¬â€ singer unidentified&quot; when actually it is by Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham, the full title being &quot;How Can You Keep On Moving (Unless You Migrate Too).&quot; The omission later caused Ry Cooder, who listened to the Ramblers album, to record the song as Traditional on the first edition of his Into the Purple Valley album, an omission he gladly corrected when informed of it. Cooder also covered another song from the same New Lost City Ramblers album, which he may have heard on a poorly labeled cassette copy: &quot;Taxes on the Farmer Feeds Us All&quot; which the New Lost City Ramblers credit to Fiddling John Carson but which the Cooder notes still list as &quot;traditional.&quot; The same is true of the track &quot;Boomer's Story,&quot; covered by the RamblersÃ¢â‚¬â€Cooder credits it as &quot;traditional,&quot; but the song was written by Carson Robison and first recorded by him in 1929 under the title &quot;The Railroad Boomer.&quot;\n\nThe group drifted apart during the latter half of the 60s. Schwarz and Seeger performed with different musicians and together formed the short lived Strange Creek Singers.\n\nThe New Lost City Ramblers' extensive recordings for the Folkways label, after the death of Moe Asch, became part of the Smithsonian Institution, which reissues Folkways titles on CD.\n\nThe New Lost City Ramblers (1958)\nThe New Lost City Ramblers Vol. II (1959)\nSongs From the Depression (1959)\nOld-Timey Songs For Children (1959)\nThe New Lost City Ramblers Vol. III (1961)\nTom Paley, John Cohen, Mike Seeger Sing Songs of The New Lost City Ramblers (1961)\nThe New Lost City Ramblers (1961)\nEarth Is Earth Sung by The New Lost City Bang Boys (1961\nThe New Lost City Ramblers Vol. 4 (1962)\nAmerican Moonshine &amp; Prohibition (1962) \nThe New Lost City Ramblers Vol. 5 (1963)\nGone to the Country (1963)\nThe New New Lost City Ramblers with Tracy Schwarz: Gone to the Country (1963)\nString Band Instrumentals (1964) (Folkways)\nRural Delivery No. 1 (1965)\nRemembrance of Things to Come (1966)\nModern Times (1968)\nThe New Lost City Ramblers with Cousin Emmy (1968) \nOn the Great Divide (1973)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a075dbf267f9d35728a0d54ea3637726f4739a","amp;dn":"The+New+Lost+City+Ramblers+-+Discography+1958-73+%28MP3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a075dbf267f9d35728a0d54ea3637726f4739a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,160,117,219,242,103,249,211,87,40,160,213,78,163,99,119,38,244,115,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
