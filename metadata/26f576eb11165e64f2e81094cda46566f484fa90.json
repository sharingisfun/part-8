Indeed, their status is remarkably similar to that of the Monkees and it's not a coincidence that both groups' music was intended to appeal to younger teenagers. The difference is that as early as 1976, the Monkees began to be considered cool by people who really knew music; it has taken 35 years for Herman's Hermits to begin receiving higher regard for their work. Of course, that lack of respect had no relevance to their success: 20 singles lofted into the Top 40 in England and America between 1964 and 1970, 16 of them in the Top 20, and most of those Top Ten as well. Artistically, they were rated far lower than the Hollies, the Searchers, or Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, but commercially, the Hermits were only a couple of rungs below the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. \n\n\nGenre................: Oldies Rock\nYear.................: 2008\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Covers, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Heartbeat\n02.Travelin' Light\n03.I'll Never Dance Again\n04.Walkin' With My Angel\n05.Dream On\n06.I Wonder\n07.For Your Love\n08.Don't Try To Hurt Me\n09.Tell Me Baby\n10.I'm Henry VIII, I Am\n11.The End Of The World\n12.Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter\n13.I'm Into Something Good\n14.Your Hand In Mine\n15.Show Me Girl\n16.I Know Why\n17.Silhouettes\n18.Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\n19.Wonderful World\n20.Just A Little Bit Better\n21.Take Love Give Love\n22.A Must To Avoid\n23.The Man With The Cigar\n24.Sea Cruise\n25.Mother-In-Law\n26.I Understand (Just How You Feel)\n27.Thinkin' Of You\n28.Little Boy Sad\n29.Story Of My Life\n30.My Reservations Been Confirmed\n31.Bus Stop\n32.For Love\n\nCD2\n\n01.Where Were You When I Needed You\n02.All The Things I Do For You Baby\n03.Leaning On The Lamp Post (Album Version)\n04.Dial My Number\n05.Oo-Ee-Baby\n06.Je Suis Anglais (L'Autre Jour)\n07.Listen People\n08.You Won't Be Leaving\n09.This Door Swings Both Ways\n10.Hold On (Album Version)\n11.George And The Dragon\n12.Wild Love\n13.What Is Wrong What Is Right\n14.Bidin' My Time\n15.Got A Feeling\n16.Kansas City Loving\n17.Gotta Get Away (Stereo)\n18.Make Me Happy (Stereo)\n19.There's A Kind Of Hush All Over The World\n20.Saturday's Child\n21.If You're Thinking What I'm Thinking\n22.You Won't Be Leaving\n23.Dandy\n24.Jezebel\n25.No Milk Today\n26.Little Miss Sorrow, Child Of Tomorrow\n27.Gaslite Street\n28.Rattler\n29.East West\n30.The Future Mrs. 'Awkins\n31.Oh Mr. Porter\n32.Two Lovely Black Eyes\n33.My Old Dutch\n\nCD3\n\n01.I Can Take Or Leave Your Loving\n02.Marcel's\n03.It's Nice To Be Out In The Morning (Stereo)\n04.Holiday Inn (Stereo)\n05.Ooh She's Done It Again (Stereo)\n06.Lemon And Lime (Stereo)\n07.The Most Beautiful Thing In My Life (Stereo)\n08.Daisy Chain (Part 1) (Stereo)\n09.Daisy Chain (Part 2) (Stereo)\n10.The World Is For The Young (With Stanley Holloway) (Stereo)\n11.London Look\n12.Museum (Stereo)\n13.Upstairs, Downstairs (Stereo)\n14.Busy Line (Stereo)\n15.Moonshine Man\n16.Green Street Green (Stereo)\n17.Don't Go Out In The Rain (You're Gonna Melt) (Stereo)\n18.I Call Out Her Name\n19.One Little Pack Of Cigarettes (Stereo)\n20.Last Bus Home (Stereo)\n21.Ace, King, Queen, Jack (Stereo)\n22.Sleepy Joe\n23.Just One Girl\n24.Sunshine Girl\n25.Nobody Needs To Know\n26.Somethings Is Happening\n27.My Sentimental Friend\n28.My Lady\n29.Here Comes The Star\n30.It's Alright Now\n31.Years May Come, Years May Go\n\nCD4\n\n01.Smile Please\n02.Bet Yer Life I Do\n03.Searching For The Southern Sun\n04.Lady Barbara (Stereo)\n05.Don't Just Stand There (Stereo)\n06.Mum &amp; Dad (Stereo)\n07.Moonshine Man (Stereo Version)\n08.My Old DutchShow Me The Way To Go Home (Unedited)\n09.Wings Of Love\n10.Big Man\n11.Wait For Me, Here I Come\n12.Regardez Moi (Here Comes The Star)\n13.A Year Ago Today\n14.The Colder It Gets\n15.Big Ship (Stereo)\n16.Oh You Pretty Things (Peter Noone)\n17.Together Forever (Peter Noone)\n18.Right On Mother (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n19.Walnut Whirl (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n20.Shoo Be Doo Ah (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n21.Because You're There (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n22.Should I (Have Loved You) (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n23.Each And Every Minute (Peter Noone)\n24.Green Green Rocky Road (Peter Noone)\n25.I Do Believe In Music (Stereo) (Peter Noone)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f576eb11165e64f2e81094cda46566f484fa90","amp;dn":"Herman%27s+Hermits+-+Into+Something+Good+4CD+%282008%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f576eb11165e64f2e81094cda46566f484fa90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,245,118,235,17,22,94,100,242,232,16,148,205,164,101,102,244,132,250,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
