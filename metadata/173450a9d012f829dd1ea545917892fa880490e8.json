The first book on the market to cover conjugate heat and mass transfer in heat exchangers, author Li-Zhi Zhang goes beyond the basics to cover recent advancements in equipment for energy use and environmental control (such as heat and moisture recovery ventilators, hollow fiber membrane modules for humidification/dehumidification, membrane modules for air purification, desiccant wheels for air dehumidification and energy recovery, and honeycomb desiccant beds for heat and moisture control). Explaining the data behind and the applications of conjugated heat and mass transfer allows for the design, analysis, and optimization of heat and mass exchangers. Combining this recently discovered data into one source makes it an invaluable reference for professionals, academics, and other interested parties.\n\nA research-based approach emphasizing numerical methods in heat mass transfer\nIntroduces basic data for exchangersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ design (such as friction factors and the Nusselt/Sherwood numbers), methods to solve conjugated problems, the modeling of various heat and mass exchangers, and more\nThe first book to include recently discovered advancements of mass transfer and fluid flow in channels comprised of new materials\nIncludes illustrations to visually depict the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key concepts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:173450a9d012f829dd1ea545917892fa880490e8","amp;dn":"Conjugate+Heat+and+Mass+Transfer+in+Heat+Mass+Exchanger+Ducts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"173450a9d012f829dd1ea545917892fa880490e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,52,80,169,208,18,248,41,221,30,165,69,145,120,146,250,136,4,144,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
