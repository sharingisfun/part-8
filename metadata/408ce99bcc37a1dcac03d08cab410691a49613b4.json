Chatal Hoyuk, in what is now south central Turkey, was excavated in the early 1960s and turned out to be one of the very first places that could be called a city. The excavators found evidence of a well-established agriculture, trade, and religion, all dating back to near the end of the Stone Age. Other archaeologists' efforts in Turkey have resulted in the discovery of the ancient empire of the Hittites, lost to history for centuries. These and several other little-known and understood civilizations are described. Numerous full-color photographs and illustrations add an extra dimension to the text. Readers with a background in ancient civilizations of the Near East will most benefit from this book. The First Cities (1973; o.p.) and The Empire Builders (1974; o.p. both Time-Life) will complement it.-David N.
