What to say? I loved this when I played it back in -95 and still loves it. \n\n\n\n\n\nINFO FROM WIKIPEDIA\n\nThe Dig is a graphical adventure game developed by LucasArts and released in 1995, and a novel based on the game written by Alan Dean Foster. It was the 11th game to use the SCUMM game engine, and is famous for its connection to Steven Spielberg, and notorious for its prolonged production, that had the game bordering on vaporware.\n\nIt is the most serious LucasArts adventure game, containing no slapstick, and relatively little subtle humor, an element found abundantly in all other LucasArts adventure titles. It is also the only one to perfectly fit into the science fiction genre.\n\n\n\nIts great anyway, just search wikipedia for more info :)\n\n\n&quot;This compilation includes: The game (of course), the manual (pdf), the musik (mp3), Walkthrough and coverarts.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df35f43d512e5e14b32b87fe59d9ca66ab5ad886","amp;dn":"The+Dig+%281+cd%29+-1995-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df35f43d512e5e14b32b87fe59d9ca66ab5ad886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,53,244,61,81,46,94,20,179,43,135,254,89,217,202,102,171,90,216,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
