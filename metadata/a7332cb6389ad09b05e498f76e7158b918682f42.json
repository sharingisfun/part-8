Animated DVDs introduce a stimulating menagerie of characters who teach French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese or German. Youngsters watch, sing, laugh, and interact with other kids, a funny professor, language-building songs, and lively classroom lessons. And because children are emotionally engaged in a language immersion setting, they really learn. Great for toddlers, preschoolers, and K-6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7332cb6389ad09b05e498f76e7158b918682f42","amp;dn":"Watch+%26+Learn+French+with+Professor+Toto+part+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7332cb6389ad09b05e498f76e7158b918682f42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,51,44,182,56,154,208,155,5,228,152,247,110,113,88,185,24,104,47,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
