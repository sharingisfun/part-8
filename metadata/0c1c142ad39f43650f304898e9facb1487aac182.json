This 3-CD set includes the complete original album together with the much bootlegged live favourite and previously unreleased Live Nassau Coliseum '76. STATION TO STATION was the soundtrack to Bowie's nightlife. \n\nCD ONE\n\nAn interesting remaster. I was perfectly happy with my 1999 remaster but I appreciate the &quot;toned-down&quot; (less loud) sound on this one and the 70s-style stereo, which is always a treat to listen to. I wish they would do it with other albums such as Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs and Young Americans. You do have to turn your volume control up a bit louder though.\n\nCD TWO\n\nAstonishingly good live cuts. Wonderful sound, great versions of the songs played by a top notch bunch of musicians. Such a pleasure to listen to. I can't stop listening to it. Within a year and three quarters, Bowie had knocked &quot;David Live&quot; into a bipperty bopperty hat.\n\nCD THREE\n\nI agree, there is a slight discernable change in sound quality, and Life On Mars (why Bowie only sang half of it I'm not sure) and Five Years are clearly a bit crackly in the background. The rest of the CD is perfectly acceptable though and I certainly would not describe it as &quot;bootleg quality&quot;. If indeed it is bootleg quality however, it is a very good bootleg ! I wish my other bootlegs sounded like this ! The playing of the band gets a tad more frenetic and sloppy as the gig reaches its climax, but isn't that always the way ? Early songs in the set list are always played more diligently.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1: 2010 Station To Station from the original stereo analogue master\n01.
