But you're wrong.\n\n\nThe truth is that most of our mental activity actually happens below the level of conscious thought. In this groundbreaking book, Dr David Lewis, director of the cutting-edge research agency Mindlab International, explores this incredible phenomenon. Delving into the mysteries of the 'zombie brain' that each of us possesses, he demonstrates how unconscious neurological processes underpin every aspect of our lives, from whether or not we find someone sexually attractive to how we resist (or give in to) temptation. In the process he shows how finger length is a reliable predictor of risk-taking behaviour, how seeing the logos of fast food chains can make you more impatient, and how holding a warm drink makes you find strangers more likeable.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992c2d94b129b1339d092b55c2ddb434c407ccf0","amp;dn":"Impulse%3A+Why+We+Do+What+We+Do+Without+Knowing+Why+We+Do+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992c2d94b129b1339d092b55c2ddb434c407ccf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,44,45,148,177,41,177,51,157,9,43,85,194,221,180,52,196,7,204,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
