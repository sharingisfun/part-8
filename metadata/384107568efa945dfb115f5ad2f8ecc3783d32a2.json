The guys have created a lot of classic rock tracks over the past couple of decades and much of it is presented in this 2-disc collection, including an acoustic version of &quot;I'll Cry for You,&quot; some rare B-sides and a couple of live tracks. Europe have several greatest hits compilations out there, but to me they are sub-par in terms of track selection and/or sound quality. This release makes up for past mistakes. All the tracks have been digitally remastered and sound great! I highly recommend shelling out the extra cash for the Japanese import as it contains two extra tracks, live versions of &quot;Ninja&quot; and &quot;On the Loose,&quot; and a booklet of color photos of the band. To me, the two extra tracks complete a release I've waited a long time for. \n\nby A.
