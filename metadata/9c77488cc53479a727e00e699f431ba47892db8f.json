In his long career, Mason has played and recorded with many of the era's most notable musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Mama Cass Elliot. Mason's best known song is &quot;Feelin' Alright?&quot;, recorded by Traffic in 1968 and covered by dozens of artists, including Joe Cocker, who had a major hit with the song in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote &quot;Hole in My Shoe&quot;, a kind of psychedelic satire that became a classic in its own right. &quot;We Just Disagree&quot;, Mason's 1977 solo hit written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of Oldies and Adult Contemporary radio playlists. His song 'Sad And Deep As You' is also covered beautifully by Warren Haynes &amp; Gov't Mule from time to time.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c77488cc53479a727e00e699f431ba47892db8f","amp;dn":"Dave+Mason+-+%5C%27The+Definitive+Collection%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c77488cc53479a727e00e699f431ba47892db8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,119,72,140,197,52,121,167,39,224,14,105,159,67,27,164,120,146,219,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
