This collection provides a diversity of voices that address the &quot;how tos&quot; of collaborative learning and writing by addressing key concerns about the process. Fresh essays consider the importance of collaborative work and peer review, the best ways to select groups in classes, integration of collaborative learning techniques into electronic environments, whether group learning and writing are appropriate for all writing classes, and ways special populations can benefit from collaborative activities. Despite its challenges, collaborative learning can prove remarkably effective and this study provides the advice to make it work smoothly and successfully.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e8dd6d9d0b444b74931995caf170aee3e90640","amp;dn":"Collaborative+Learning+and+Writing+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e8dd6d9d0b444b74931995caf170aee3e90640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,232,221,109,157,11,68,75,116,147,25,149,202,241,112,174,227,233,6,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
