Without a story, dialogue, or characters, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) (the film's title is a Hopi word roughly translated into English as &quot;life out of balance&quot;) is composed of nature imagery, manipulated in slow motion, double exposure or time lapse, juxtaposed with footage of humans' devastating environmental impact on the planet. Starting with an ancient rock wall painting, the film moves through sequences depicting clouds, waves, and other natural features, then into man-made landscapes such as buildings, earth-altering construction machinery, and cars. The message of director Godfrey Reggio is clear: humans are destroying the planet, and all of human progress is pointlessly foolish. Also notable for its intense, atmospheric score by new age composer Philip Glass, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) was a labor of love for Reggio, who spent several years filming it. The film was followed by sequels, Powaqqatsi (1988), Anima Mundi (1991) and Naqoyqatsi (1999). \n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/ | Rating: 8.1 / 10 (11,191 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Koyaanisqatsi.1982.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.70 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 22mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 950 Kbps\nSource                           : MGM NTSC DVD5\n                                       \nVideo.                         \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                         : 2 443 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 500 Kbps\nWidth                            : 708 pixels\nHeight                           : 556 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.248\nStream size                      : 1.41 GiB (83%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\nAudio.                         \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 265 MiB (15%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:00:48.040                     : :Chapter 2\n00:03:40.160                     : :Chapter 3\n00:11:16.200                     : :Chapter 4\n00:15:46.840                     : :Chapter 5\n00:22:06.880                     : :Chapter 6\n00:29:52.520                     : :Chapter 7\n00:30:29.520                     : :Chapter 8\n00:37:58.240                     : :Chapter 9\n00:39:12.440                     : :Chapter 10\n00:42:24.040                     : :Chapter 11\n01:03:12.160                     : :Chapter 12\n01:05:07.600                     : :Chapter 13\n01:13:37.640                     : :Chapter 14\n01:17:14.480                     : :Chapter 15\n01:18:46.200                     : :Chapter 16\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc1bf8ab84b8dc3082264d61f27963d1810aca8e","amp;dn":"Koyaanisqatsi.1982.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc1bf8ab84b8dc3082264d61f27963d1810aca8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,27,248,171,132,184,220,48,130,38,77,97,242,121,99,209,129,10,202,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
