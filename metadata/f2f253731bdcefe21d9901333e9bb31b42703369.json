He's been shuttling between the 21st century and the 1940s searching for a Victorian atrocity called the bishop's bird stump. It's part of a project to restore the famed Coventry Cathedral, destroyed in a Nazi air raid over a hundred years earlier.\r\n\r\nBut then Verity Kindle, a fellow time traveler, inadvertently brings back something from the past. Now Ned must jump back to the Victorian era to help Verity put things right--not only to save the project but to prevent altering history itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f253731bdcefe21d9901333e9bb31b42703369","amp;dn":"Connie+Willis+-+To+Say+Nothing+of+the+Dog+%28Oxford+Time+Travel+%232","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f253731bdcefe21d9901333e9bb31b42703369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,242,83,115,27,220,239,226,29,153,1,51,62,155,179,27,66,112,51,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
