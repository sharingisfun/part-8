Founded in 2004 in Weybridge, Surrey, the band is comprised of Josh Franceschi (vocals), Max Helyer (guitar), Chris Miller (guitar), Matt Barnes (bass), and Dan Flint (drums). They made their recording debut with We Know What It Means to Be Alone (2006), a four-track EP that was followed by another, Untitled 4 Track EP (2007). You Me at Six subsequently made their full-length album debut with Take Off Your Colours (2007) on Slam Dunk Records in the United Kingdom and Epitaph Records in the United States. Produced by Matty O'Grady and John Mitchell, Take Off Your Colours reached number 25 on the U.K. albums chart and spawned the hit singles &quot;Save It for the Bedroom,&quot; &quot;Finders Keepers,&quot; and &quot;Kiss and Tell.&quot; Thanks in part to heavy touring, including a performance at the 2007 Slam Dunk Festival, the popularity of You Me at Six grew steadily in the wake of their album debut and earned them a nomination for Best British Band at the 2008 and 2009 Kerrang! Awards. Working once again with producers O'Grady and Mitchell, You Me at Six released their second album, Hold Me Down (2010), on Virgin Records in the U.K. and Epitaph Records in the U.S. Featuring the singles &quot;Underdog&quot; and &quot;Liquid Confidence,&quot; Hold Me Down reached the Top Five of the U.K. albums chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731b9bb08e499bf27829de930b3c2d193a02e164","amp;dn":"You+Me+at+Six+-+Cavalier+Youth+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731b9bb08e499bf27829de930b3c2d193a02e164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,27,155,176,142,73,155,242,120,41,222,147,11,60,45,25,58,2,225,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
