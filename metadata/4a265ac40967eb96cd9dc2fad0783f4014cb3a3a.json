He is something of an underground mercenary, hired by everyday people to fix situations that cannot be dealt with through legal means. These fix-its usually begin simply, but grow into complex problems that begin to involve more and more science-fiction and supernatural elements as the novels continue. The second novel, Legacies, is the only one that is completely free of any overtly supernatural elements.\n\n\nContents:\nThe Tomb (1984) Length 15:07:32\nLegacies (1998) Length 11:51:39\nConspiracies (1999) Length 10:58:04\nAll the Rage (2000) Length 12:20:17\nHosts (2001) Length 12:25:10\nThe Haunted Air (2002) Length 14:56:58\nGateways (2003) Length 12:46:12\nCrisscross (2004) Length 13:42:12\nInfernal (2005) Length 11:04:15\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n--------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a265ac40967eb96cd9dc2fad0783f4014cb3a3a","amp;dn":"Repairman+Jack++%5BBooks+1-9%5D+-+F.+Paul+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a265ac40967eb96cd9dc2fad0783f4014cb3a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,38,90,196,9,103,235,150,205,157,194,250,208,120,63,64,20,203,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
