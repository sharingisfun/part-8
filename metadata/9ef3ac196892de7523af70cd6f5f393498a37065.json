Framework 1.1 (free download from Microsoft)  \nStarting from GPL or N2003/N2002/N4 create a common database which can then be written to many racing simulator formats or 3DS. All formats written can be read by SimED. In addition. 3DS can be read by many 3D editing applications. \nObject File Formats Supported\n\nCreate database from N2003/N2002/N4 .PTF or GPL .TRK Note that PTF and TRK files supplied with the games N2003 and GPL cannot be opened. \nOption to allow creation of track database from scratch. \nExport:- 3DS; PTF (N2003) ; GMT (GTR2, rFactor, GTL, GTR) ; MTS (F1CC,F1-2002) \nCreation of AIW files converting from N2003/GPL .LP files. \nCreation of CAM files for GTR2, rFactor, GTL converting from N2003/GPL .CAM files. \nDatabase stored in XML format to allow editing using 3rd party applications (e.g. XMLSpy, MS Access etc.) \nDatabase\n\nDescribes track with simple tables. The track's geometry is contained in Section tables which have child tables describing the cross-section and grips of the track surface. \nThe structure of the database makes it extremely simple to change the material and textures assigned to surfaces both globally and individually. \nControl of mesh resolution for 3DS, GMT and MTS files. A resolution can be defined for the complete track and then overridden for sections requiring greater or less detail. \nTrkMaker includes a grid based editor or an external application such as XMLSpy can be used to modify the database.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ef3ac196892de7523af70cd6f5f393498a37065","amp;dn":"3DSimED+v2.6a+%26+TrkMaker+v1.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ef3ac196892de7523af70cd6f5f393498a37065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,243,172,25,104,146,222,117,35,175,112,205,111,95,57,52,152,163,112,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
