She flashes back and \nremembers her coming-of-age. Her recollections are sometimes less\nthan sweet, particularly those of her troubled and alcoholic \nstep-father. Her memories of Robin, her first-love, are much happier\nand she also recalls her colorful Aunt Starr -- who's visit is fun\nbut also detrimental to her family's health. The setting of 1950s \nLas Vegas' bomb testing is increasingly significant to the \ndevelopment of the story","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee3db21dcc2c3da549a2e70e3230efc3cf3d89e9","amp;dn":"Desert.Bloom.1986.DVBRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee3db21dcc2c3da549a2e70e3230efc3cf3d89e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,61,178,29,204,44,61,165,73,162,231,14,50,48,239,195,207,61,137,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
