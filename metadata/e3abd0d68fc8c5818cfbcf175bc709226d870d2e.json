It is a compilation of latter-day songs, the band members' solo hits and the band's collaborations with other artists (hence the album's credit to &quot;Queen+&quot;). It was released on November 8, 1999. Despite being a greatest hits compilation, the first two tracks actually made a debut on this album, although these are only new versions of classic Queen songs (a number of such albums have typically included at least one new track to help drive sales).\n\n1. \t&quot;The Show Must Go On (Live, Theatre National de Chaillot, Paris, 1997)&quot;   \tQueen \t\n\n    Performed by Queen + Elton John\n    Live from the premiere of Ballet for Life in Paris 1997\n    Originally from Innuendo\n\n\t4:26\n2. \t&quot;Under Pressure (Rah Mix)&quot;   \tQueen, David Bowie \t\n\n    Performed by Queen + David Bowie\n    Originally from Hot Space\n\n\t4:08\n3. \t&quot;Barcelona (Single Version)&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury, Mike Moran \t\n\n    Performed by Freddie Mercury + Montserrat CaballÃƒÂ©\n    From Barcelona\n\n\t4:25\n4. \t&quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You (Album Version)&quot;   \tBrian May, Frank Musker, Elizabeth Lamers \t\n\n    From Made in Heaven\n\n\t4:18\n5. \t&quot;Somebody to Love (Live, The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert For AIDS Awareness, Wembley, April 1992)&quot;   \tMercury \t\n\n    Performed by George Michael + Queen\n    Live at Wembley Stadium 1992, from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\n    From Five Live\n    Originally from A Day at the Races\n\n\t5:07\n6. \t&quot;You Don't Fool Me&quot;   \tQueen \t\n\n    From Made in Heaven\n\n\t5:22\n7. \t&quot;Heaven for Everyone (Single Version)&quot;   \tRoger Taylor \t\n\n    From Made in Heaven\n\n\t4:37\n8. \t&quot;Las Palabras de Amor (The Words of Love)&quot;   \tMay \t\n\n    From Hot Space\n\n\t4:29\n9. \t&quot;Driven by You&quot;   \tMay \t\n\n    Performed by Brian May\n    From Back to the Light\n\n\t4:09\n10. \t&quot;Living on My Own (Julian Raymond Album Mix)&quot;   \tMercury \t\n\n    Performed by Freddie Mercury\n    This version erroneously included, as the 1993 No More Brothers Radio Mix is listed on the compilation's sleeve notes\n    From The Freddie Mercury Album\n    Originally from Mr. Bad Guy\n\n\t3:37\n11. \t&quot;Let Me Live&quot;   \tQueen \t\n\n    From Made in Heaven\n\n\t4:45\n12. \t&quot;The Great Pretender&quot;   \tBuck Ram \t\n\n    Performed by Freddie Mercury\n    non-album single\n\n\t3:26\n13. \t&quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;   \tMercury \t\n\n    From A Kind of Magic\n\n\t3:31\n14. \t&quot;Another One Bites The Dust (Small Soldiers Remix)&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t\n\n    Featuring Wyclef Jean, Pras &amp; Free\n    Originally from The Game\n\n\t4:20\n15. \t&quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;   \tMay \t\n\n    From Queen Rocks\n\n\t4:11\n16. \t&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;   \tQueen \t\n\n    From Innuendo\n\n\t4:22\n17. \t&quot;Thank God It's Christmas&quot;   \tMay, Taylor \t\n\n    1984 non-album single release\n\n\t4:19","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3abd0d68fc8c5818cfbcf175bc709226d870d2e","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Greatest+Hits+-+VOLUME+3+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3abd0d68fc8c5818cfbcf175bc709226d870d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,171,208,214,143,200,197,129,140,251,207,23,91,199,9,34,109,135,13,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
