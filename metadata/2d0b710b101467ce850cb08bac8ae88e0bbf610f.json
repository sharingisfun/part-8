Using a pattern-based approach, each case is presented as a difficult diagnostic choice with two or even three possible diagnoses for the pathologist. For each case there is a description illustrating an expert's diagnosis and analysis, along with commentary providing additional context on the evaluation of such specimens. The book places special emphasis on avoiding diagnostic pitfalls. Each case discussion is supported with several high quality color photomicrographs that facilitate an extensive visual history and learning experience. Brief references to the literature are also included.\n\nThe book presents a foreword by David L. Page, MD, Professor of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d0b710b101467ce850cb08bac8ae88e0bbf610f","amp;dn":"Breast+Pathology++%28Consultant+Pathology+Vol.+6%29-+Sanders+%5BPDF%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d0b710b101467ce850cb08bac8ae88e0bbf610f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,11,113,11,16,20,103,206,133,12,176,139,172,138,232,142,11,191,97,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
