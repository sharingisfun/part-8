A new program entitled &quot;The Lester Guy Show&quot; is debuting on the Zoblotnick Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). Most of the cast is nuts, the crew is incompetent and everything that could go wrong always does. Of course, this makes the show a hit.\n\nWhile mixing the sound for an episode of the second season of Twin Peaks, Lynch was hit with a sudden inspiration. &quot;It just came into my head, the idea of people trying to do something successful and having it all go wrong.&quot; Following the initial success of Twin Peaks, David Lynch and Mark Frost were hot properties in Television. When they approached ABC with the idea for &quot;On the Air,&quot; the network was eager to take them up on the offer. The show itself was a half-hour absurdist comedy featuring many of the cast and crew from Twin Peaks. The pilot tested very well, and six more episodes were ordered. However, by the time it came to scheduling the On the Air, things with Twin Peaks had already fallen apart, and the network was no longer eager to work with Lynch. &quot;During that time everything was going belly up with Twin Peaks, and there wasn't any support from ABC for this show at all. They really hated it.&quot; The series' broadcast was delayed and finally run during the summer, a time when most networks know people are away from their television sets, thus they dump undesirable shows then. Lynch knew the timeslot meant certain death for the show at the hands of the network. &quot;I've heard that summertime is pretty much the worst time you can be on, but we're going on in summer. I've heard that Saturday night is the worst night of the week to be on, and we're going on Saturday night.&quot; As expected, the show received poor ratings, and only three of the seven episodes were aired by ABC before they gave it the axe (all seven episodes were aired overseas however).\n\n\nEPISODES 01-03\n\n\nEpisode 1\nOriginal air date: 6/20/92 on the ABC Network.\nProduced by Gregg Fienberg\nWritten by Mark Frost and David Lynch\nDirected by David Lynch\n\nFeaturing: Dorsay Alavi (chorus girl), Vanessa Angel (chorus girl), Reo Danzelle (chorus girl), Carolyn Lowry (chorus girl), Raleigh Friend (hurry up twin), Raymond Friend (hurry up twin), Buddy Douglas (phillip morris messenger), Bruce Grossberg (control booth technician), Irwin Keyes (shorty the stagehand), Everett Greenbaum (ZBC announcer), Susan Russell (announcers assistant), Angelo Badalamenti (piano player), Walt Robles (flying stagehand), Peter Rocca (stunt double).\n\nSummary:\nIt's 1957 and a new TV show is about to premiere. It's &quot;The Lester Guy Show&quot; staring Lester Guy, a washed up film star who couldn't get a job anywhere until he's hired by the president of the Zoblotnick Broadcasting Network (ZBC) to star in his own show. Unfortunately, the show is hindered by Lester's ego; an incompetent director who got the job only because his uncle owns the network even though no one can understand him; a producer who's constantly nervous; the spacy blond costar named Betty Hudson who has no experience in TV; and an equally dysfunctional crew. Things seem to go well on the rehearsal, but of course the actual show is a disaster. Props break, sound effects get mixed up, and cues are missed. Betty ends up saving the show by singing a song her mother taught her, stealing the show. The phones light up, and of course, the show ends up being a hit.\n\n\nEpisode 2\nOriginal air date: Never aired in the US\nProduced by Deepak Nayar\nCo-Executive Producer: Robert Engels\nWritten by Mark Frost\nDirected by Lesli Linka Glatter\n\nGuest Starring: Sydney Lassik (Mr. Zoblotnick)\nFeaturing: Joseph Pecoraro (Guiseppe), Ben Kronen (Waiter), Irwin Keyes (shorty the stagehand), Buddy Douglas (Buddy Morris), Raleigh Friend (hurry up twin), Raymond Friend (hurry up twin).\n\nSummary:\nCards, letters and gifts are pouring in for Betty Hudson after her performance on the first episode. This all makes Lester jealous, especially when Betty gets an invitation to have dinner with Mr. Zoblotnick, the owner of the network. Lester and Budwaller plot to get Betty off the show. Meanwhile, Betty is nervous over meeting Mr. Zoblotnick. The rest of the cast and crew reassure her, but Lester, Budwaller and Thorne plot to sabotage the dinner. Lester poses as the car driver and convinces Betty that Mr. Zoblotnick is a womanizing cruel man who is paranoid about his hairpiece and his wife. This makes Betty completely paranoid for the dinner. Lester poses as a waiter, Budwaller and Thorne spy on them from a nearby booth. Betty is so nervous during dinner that she says all the wrong things, including mentioning Zoblotnick's wife and wig. But unfortunately for Lester and Budwaller, Mr. Z loves all this and thinks it's a big joke planned by them and Betty. Lester ends up blowing his cover as well as Budwaller's. Mr. Z leaves to call his wife, and the episode ends with Betty asking Lester if he would like her to ask Mr. Z to give him a raise, since he's having to make ends meet working a second job as a waiter.\n\n\nEpisode 3\nOriginal air date: 6/27/92 on the ABC Network\nProduced by Deepak Nayar\nCo-Executive Producer: Robert Engels\nWritten by Robert Engels\nDirected by Jack Fisk\n\nGuest Starring: Diana Bellamy (Ethel Thissle), Richard Riehle (Dr. Winky), Charles Tyner (Professor R. Answer)\nFeaturing: Peter Pitofsky (worker #1), Irwin Keyes (shorty the stagehand), Loren Janes (executive) Everett Greenbaum (announcer), Buddy Douglas (Buddy Morris), Raleigh Friend (hurry up twin), Raymond Friend (hurry up twin).\n\nSummary:\nDuring rehearsals McConigle's allergies act up. Lester has a plan to ruin Betty: a quiz show where she competes against Professor Answer, the man with the highest I.Q. ever measured, for $64,000. This will show the world how stupid Betty really is, or so the theory goes. Of course, the game is rigged. Meanwhile, Dr. Winky pays a visit and gives McConigle a potion that causes his allergies to go away. The quiz show takes place. Betty's partner is Mrs. Thissle, her grade school teacher, who proves to be a match for Professor Answer. Unfortunately, Mrs. Thissle thinks this is a rehearsal. When she realizes it's going out live, she panics. Lester thinks Professor Answer can't loose now, but the sound effect for a wrong answer drives the Professor crazy. McConigle, who's gotten high on his allergy medicine, stumbles on the stage and he and Betty end up winning the quiz show by a chance fluke answer.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103505/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103505/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEp. 4-6 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4535943/Lynch-Frost_-_On_the_air_4-6.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4535943/Lynch-Frost_-_On_the_air_4-6.avi&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEp. 7 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4535959/Lynch-Frost_-_On_the_air_7.avi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4535959/Lynch-Frost_-_On_the_air_7.avi&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:160ab5fb79f2c1c42665628b3de7767b9b336b83","amp;dn":"Lynch-Frost+-+On+the+air+1-3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"160ab5fb79f2c1c42665628b3de7767b9b336b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,10,181,251,121,242,193,196,38,101,98,139,61,231,118,123,155,51,107,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
