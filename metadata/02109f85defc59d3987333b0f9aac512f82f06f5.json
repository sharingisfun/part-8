It was written in response to recurring posts asking the same questions and the fact that many answers were often wrong and occasionally dangerous. It hasnt undergone any changes or revisions since then. While the original content remains valid we thought it was time it underwent an update. This is a significant revision most sections have been re-written and a number of new sections added. We hope you will find it useful. It is offered in good faith but the content should be validated and confirmed from other sources before being relied on even in an emergency situation. There are very few books aimed at the Practicing Medicine after the End of the World As We Know It market which is hardly surprising! So we hope this book fills a void. We also hope it will be useful for those people delivering health care in remote or austere environments.It is not designed as a how to do x reference although there is some of that.
