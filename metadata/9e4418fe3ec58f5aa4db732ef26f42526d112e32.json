Along the way, they bump up against quirky science and even quirkier personalities, including Leonard Susskind, the former Bronx plumber who invented string theory; Ed Witten, the soft-spoken genius who coined the enigmatic M-theory; even Stephen Hawking.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4418fe3ec58f5aa4db732ef26f42526d112e32","amp;dn":"Trespassing+on+Einstein%27s+Lawn+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4418fe3ec58f5aa4db732ef26f42526d112e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,68,24,254,62,197,143,90,164,219,115,46,242,111,66,82,109,17,46,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
