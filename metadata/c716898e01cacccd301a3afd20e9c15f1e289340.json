We appreciate all the time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve spent using flights of the tools and providing feedback and we are excited for you to begin sharing your applications with everyone running Windows 10. For more information on developing Universal Windows Apps, see the Building Apps For Windows blog.\n\nOffice on Windows 10\n\nThanks to all of you who have been using the new Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint mobile apps on Windows 10. There are a few changes to the apps coming up that are part of helping them get ready for their release with Windows 10. You may have already noticed that on PCs and tablets weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added Ã¢â‚¬Å“MobileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the app names (to help distinguish them from the Office desktop suite), while on phones we simply call the apps Word, Excel and PowerPoint. We will also remove Ã¢â‚¬Å“PreviewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the app names and in about one week, you will need an Office 365 subscription to edit on Windows 10 PCs and larger tablets.\n\nSimilar to what we announced in March, viewing and most editing will remain free for non-commercial use on devices of 10.1Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or less. Otherwise, you will need a qualifying Office 365 subscription. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an Office 365 subscription, you can sign up for a free trial at www.office.com/try. You can also always edit your documents for free in Office Online at www.office.com. The full featured OneNote Universal App will come installed with Windows 10 and similar to OneNote on all other devices, editing is free","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c716898e01cacccd301a3afd20e9c15f1e289340","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Build+10240+Professional+x86+Multi+ISO%27S+AR%2FRU%2FSP%2FCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c716898e01cacccd301a3afd20e9c15f1e289340","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,22,137,142,1,202,204,205,48,26,58,253,32,233,193,95,30,40,147,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
