It contains TSBs and service campaigns going back to 1980. Full service manuals from 1998 to 2009, and owner's manuals from 2003 to 2009.\n\nThe data contained within is dated Sep 29, 2008\n\nThis is set up as a Windows XP VM that can run on the free (and included) VMware Player. It is already configured and cracked once you start the VM. Service information can be browsed by model year, make, and model, as well as VIN.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea3c7466c70d2f2e08ef8cc3ce1d40f37c54f9e0","amp;dn":"GM+SI+Service+Information+1980+through+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea3c7466c70d2f2e08ef8cc3ce1d40f37c54f9e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,60,116,102,199,13,47,46,8,239,140,195,206,29,64,243,124,84,249,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
