Francis Robinson and his team set out to address this, revealing the complex and sometimes contrary nature ofMuslim culture. \n\nAs well as taking on the issues uppermost in everyones minds, such as the role of religious and political fundamentalism, they demonstrate the importance of commerce; literacy and learning; Islamic art; the effects of immigration, exodus, and conquest; and the roots of current crises in the Middle East, Bosnia, and the Gulf. Throughout, emphasis is placed on the interaction between Islam and the West, from the first Latin translations of the Quran to the fatwa on Salman Rushdie. \n\nThis elegant book deliberately sets out to dismantle the Western impression of Islam as a monolithic world and replace it with a balanced view, from current issues of fundamentalism to its dynamic culture and art.\n\n\nTitle: The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nYear: 1996\nFormat: PDF (Scanned)\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
