The missions are varied, one may ask you to kill as many gypsies as possible, in another you must destroy helicopters with an RPG. Subtitles are in Romanian language and of course full of swearing: P\n\nIf you like this mod, please give it a Like on Facebook\n\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16360159a2c8897ea7e1c3742d619abc7c0208eb","amp;dn":"GTA+Vali%27s+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16360159a2c8897ea7e1c3742d619abc7c0208eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,54,1,89,162,200,137,126,167,225,195,116,45,97,154,188,124,2,8,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
