The central character of the series is said to be the 24th Phantom. The unusual character designs are the work of Peter Chung, creator of ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½on Flux.\n\nThe show debuted in 1994 to rave reviews, though it survived only 33 episodes before it was relegated to weekend repeats in 1996. Along with action sequences, stories focused on intelligent plotting and character development, winning the series praise for its subtle teaching of such values as individuality, freedom, and the volatility of humanity. It also spawned comic books tie-ins and other merchandise.&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_2040\n\n\nThere is no official release of this entire series on home video so if you like the series please continue seeding so that other fans can download as well.
