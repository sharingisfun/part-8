The player, as Mario or Luigi, is able to defeat enemies by stomping them or using items that bestow magical powers.\n\nMario and Luigi are given a wider range of abilities than in previous Super Mario games, including flying or sliding down slopes. In addition, Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces numerous elements, such as new enemy characters and the use of a world map to transition between levels, that have reappeared in or have influenced subsequent Mario games","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f42c85839af45a757247c0f253dfc38cd0f326","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Bros+3+for+Android+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64f42c85839af45a757247c0f253dfc38cd0f326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,244,44,133,131,154,244,90,117,114,71,192,242,83,223,195,140,208,243,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
