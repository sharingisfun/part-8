It was a dance number with song by Moira Shearer\n\ncalled Ophelia's Song. It looked interesting so I downloaded the video to have a\n\nlook.\n\nIt was interesting to me but was not entirely intelligible, although it was in\n\nEnglish. So I searched for subtitles. They were hard to find. I finally located a\n\ncopy in a most unlikely place and downloaded them. I found trouble there. After\n\nconsiderable effort I straightened them out and fitted them to the video.\n\nThe result is enclosed. I enjoyed watching the first part of this opera/ballet, but\n\nnot so much the rest. \n\nIt appears to be a deluxe, expensive production. It seemed a shame to discard the \n\nefforts of my labors, so I decided to share them with others. Here it is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d753bc5fa52a7f21666f8448e4dbafcc91b3ad05","amp;dn":"The+Tales+of+Hoffmann+%281951%29+with+ENG+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d753bc5fa52a7f21666f8448e4dbafcc91b3ad05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,83,188,95,165,42,127,33,102,111,132,72,228,219,175,204,145,179,173,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
