Using a sparse combination of female vocalists, drums, piano, bass and percussion, this album was Brasil &amp;#039;66 at its leanest. &quot;One Note Samba/Spanish Flea&quot; cleverly combines two popular songs, one of Bossa Nova fame, the other straight out of the Tijuana Brass catalog. Henry Mancini&amp;#039;s &quot;Lujon&quot; (from the excellent Mr. Lucky Goes Latin album) is given vocals and retitled &quot;Slow Hot Wind&quot;. &quot;O Pato&quot; and &quot;Agua De Beber&quot; cover a couple more tracks from the popular Brazilian repertoire, and the American popular scene is represented by &quot;Going Out Of My Head&quot; and &quot;Day Tripper&quot;. One of the more interesting tunes here is &quot;Berimbau&quot;, based on a Brazilian chant. (Interesting tidbit: &quot;Mas Que Nada&quot; has been misspelled, in perpetuity, as &quot;Mais Que Nada&quot; on Brasil 66 albums!)\n\nFiles:\n01 Mais Que Nada (Ma-sh Kay Nada).mp3\n02 One Note Samba - Spanish Flea.mp3\n03 The Joker.mp3\n04 Going Out Of My Head.mp3\n05 Tim Dom Dom (Chim Dome Dome).mp3\n06 Daytripper.mp3\n07 Aqua De Beber (Aqwa Gee Beberr).mp3\n08 Slow Hot Wind.mp3\n09 O Pato (O Pawtoo).mp3\n10 Berimbau (Ber-in-bough).mp3\n\nNfo:\nFirst in what I hope to be a series of old vinyl \nrecords re-released in digital format for new fans worldwide.\nI personally remastered this vinyl record to CD and then MP3.\n\nGuilty:\nunderdesign\n\nFriendly:\n32oz.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f090cb287020d516788fd09257c2d02b68bb2aca","amp;dn":"Sergio_Mendes_and_Brazil_66","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f090cb287020d516788fd09257c2d02b68bb2aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,144,203,40,112,32,213,22,120,143,208,146,87,194,208,43,104,187,42,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
