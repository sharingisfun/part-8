Thankfully, she decided to make the record something of a special occasion. Working with arrangers Etta and Cedar Walton, producer John Snyder and a terrific lineup of musicians ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ including Red Holloway, John Clayton, Billy Higgins, Cedar Walton, Josh Sklair and her son, Sametto ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ James has created a terrific Christmas record, one that is firmly in her style yet contains surprises. First of all, she sings &quot;O Holy Night&quot; in both English and French. She also reworks &quot;Silent Night&quot; into a plaintive, bluesy plea. Each song on the album doesn't sound like a traditional carol, even if they're very familiar ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ it all sounds like James, and it all sounds good. James fans may not feel like they need a Christmas album from her, but after hearing 12 Songs of Christmas, they'll be quite pleased indeed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cc4c3743d0a65c2b2a7cfa4cb5f10b513f4cc13","amp;dn":"Etta+James+-+12+Songs+of+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cc4c3743d0a65c2b2a7cfa4cb5f10b513f4cc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,196,195,116,61,10,101,194,178,167,207,164,203,95,16,181,19,244,204,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
