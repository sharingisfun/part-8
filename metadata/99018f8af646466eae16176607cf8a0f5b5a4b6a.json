Born and raised in Devonport, Auckland, she performed in various singing and drama classes as a child, and at the age of thirteen signed with Universal. Yelich-O'Connor adopted her stage name due to her fascination with &quot;royals and aristocracy&quot;, but felt the name Lord was too masculine so added an 'e' to make it more feminine.\n\nHer musical debut was an EP, entitled The Love Club, which was released in November 2012, and her first single, &quot;Royals&quot;, debuted at number one on the New Zealand Top 40, and also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2013, making her the first New Zealand solo artist to have a number one song in the United States. Her debut album, Pure Heroine, was released in September 2013, receiving critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide.\n\nHer work has earned her numerous awards and accolades. In October 2013, she jointly won the 2013 Silver Scroll award for &quot;Royals,&quot; which celebrates outstanding songwriting achievements in original New Zealand pop music. For the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Lorde received four nominations, in which she won Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for &quot;Royals.&quot;\n\n2013 - Pure Heroine\n\n01  Tennis Court.opus\n\n02  400 Lux.opus\n\n03  Royals.opus\n\n04  Ribs.opus\n\n05  Buzzcut Season.opus\n\n06  Team.opus\n\n07  Glory and Gore.opus\n\n08  Still Sane.opus\n\n09  White Teeth Teens.opus\n\n10  A World Alone.opus\n\n\n2013 - The Love Club EP\n\n01  Bravado.opus\n\n02  Royals.opus\n\n03  Million Dollar Bills.opus\n\n04  The Love Club.opus\n\n05  Biting Down.opus","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99018f8af646466eae16176607cf8a0f5b5a4b6a","amp;dn":"Lorde+-+Pure+Heroine+-+The+Love+Club+-+OPUS+520+MAX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99018f8af646466eae16176607cf8a0f5b5a4b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,1,143,138,246,70,70,110,174,22,23,102,7,207,138,15,91,90,75,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
