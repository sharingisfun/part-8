The film is based on a play by Art Cohn and stars Robert Ryan, Audrey Totter, George Tobias, Alan Baxter and Wallace Ford.\n\nOur overall rating for The Set-Up is: very good, a genuinely well-made film that has many impressive qualities - a rewarding film that makes compelling viewing. \n\nA simple story of gut-wrenching humanity. One of the great noirs.\n\nOne for the Ten Best lists. This is the boxing movie to lick all others, with Ryan impeccable as the ageing fighter gearing up for a bout he's expected to lose; Audrey Totter leaving him because she can't stand the mental and physical battering of the fight business, wandering the streets amid snatches of ringside radio commentary; and an invading sense of desolation the result. \n[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/840/n8x.png[/img]\nGreat blue moments in black-and-white from a director whose early work is still outstanding: the film burns with the humanity that Raging Bull never quite achieves, an expression of masochism mixed with futile pride that is the essence of boxing as a movie myth.\n\nThe clock on the square at the beginning shows 9:05PM, and the same clock at the end shows 10:16PM. The movie takes place in real time. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.04gb\nDuration.... 01:12:23\nCodec.......
