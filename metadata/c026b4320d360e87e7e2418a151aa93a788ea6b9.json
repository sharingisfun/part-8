But writers who predict or lament this outcome by extrapolating technological advances into the future consistently neglect to &quot;run the numbers&quot; for a side-by-side comparison of digital with biological intelligence. &quot;Brains and Computers&quot; guides readers step-by-step through the digital components and processes that constitute the World Wide Web and then through the biological components and processes that constitute the human brain. See for yourself what differentiates brains from computers and ponder what that implies for both artificial and human intelligence. &quot;Brains and Computers&quot;, despite referencing some very large numbers, requires neither mathematical nor scientific expertise and can be read in half an hour.\n\nAbout the Author:\n Tuck Newport was born and spent his childhood in Hawaii. During his twenties, he worked as a journalist for Honolulu's morning newspaper; as the press aide to U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye in Washington, D.C.; and as the publisher of a bi-weekly magazine, the Hawaii Observer. Newport subsequently moved to Los Angeles and became either a founder or a manager of various software, data network, and telecom businesses. He continues to indulge his residual entrepreneurial instincts by investing in other peoples' high-tech startups. For two decades, Newport taught occasional seminars in a variety of subjects at his alma mater, Occidental College, where he majored in history and graduated with honors. Newport also received a master's degree in management (as a Sloan Fellow) from Stanford University. He enjoys hiking in the hills and mountains around Los Angeles with his dogs and other miscreants","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c026b4320d360e87e7e2418a151aa93a788ea6b9","amp;dn":"Brains+and+Computers+-+Tuck+Newport","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c026b4320d360e87e7e2418a151aa93a788ea6b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,38,180,50,13,54,14,135,231,226,65,138,21,26,169,58,120,142,166,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
