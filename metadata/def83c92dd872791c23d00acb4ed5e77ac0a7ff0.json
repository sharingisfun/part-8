In practice, the two billings can be interchangeable; many compilations containing the group's '60s hits as well as Valli solo recordings are credited to Frankie Valli &amp; the Four Seasons as well.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/frankie-valli-the-four-seasons-p196796/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/frankie-valli-the-four-seasons-p196796/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThis three-CD set is a reminder of just how rich and diverse the work of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons was, beyond their ubiquitous chart hits. Those songs have been available from various labels over the years, but this collection is the best available look at the true range of their work, covering their history (and Valli's solo career) from 1962 through 1978 beyond the hits, including good B-sides and oft-overlooked album tracks. The group had a lot to offer on repertory beyond the Bob Gaudio-Bob Crewe originals through which they became famous. The 36 songs on disc one and two, covering the years 1962-1967, illustrate precisely how the quartet's sound evolved, and the complexity that it achieved. Moreover, the presence of these sides makes this collection far more interesting and exciting than just another compilation of hits by the group. The presence of cuts such as their parody of Bob Dylan's &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright&quot; (credited to &quot;The Wonder Who&quot;) and tracks off of the controversial Genuine Imitation Life Gazette album makes this a truly ambitious effort. Valli's solo sides, including &quot;The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore,&quot; are certain to add to the appeal of this disc. One comes away with far greater admiration for the group and, if anything, a desire to hear more of their work. Although this set was produced in the middle to late '80s, the production and engineering holds up surprisingly well, even in the wake of the huge advances in digital audio technology in the years since. This still may be more appropriate as a holiday gift than a casual purchase, but this set holds up remarkably well, and it will offer even the casual listener a range of delightful surprises.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/25th-anniversary-collection-r20963/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/25th-anniversary-collection-r20963/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000346X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000346X&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
