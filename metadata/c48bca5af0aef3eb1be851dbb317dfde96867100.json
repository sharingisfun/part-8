Whether you're struggling with insomnia, the kids have eczema, or your partner is feeling under the weather, this series could have the answer. With easy recipes ethnobotanist James Wong shows how to make simple creams, salves, teas and much, much more from the stuff growing in your window box, the local garden centre or in the hedgerows. Using the flowers, fruit, vegetables, roots, trees and herbs that are all around us James provides preparations to help relieve a whole range of common conditions, including acne, anxiety, cold sores and general aches and pains - plus great ideas for beauty fixes such as bath bombs and shampoos.\n\n\n1)  Fruit \nIn this opening episode, James reveals that there is more to some fruit than just the nutritional value. He uses figs to relieve constipation, hops for a good night's sleep, turns kiwis and papayas into a soothing face mask and uses goji berries in a soup that could help feed a cold - and all from things that might be found in any fruit bowl. James tries out his remedies on members of the public, with some surprising results.\n\n2)  Flowers \nIn the second episode of this six-part series exploring plant-based natural remedies and beauty treatments, ethnobotanist James Wong turns the spotlight on flowers. He reveals the historical use of marigolds, violas and elderflowers as ways to help relieve the symptoms of everyday ailments such as sore throats, acne and eczema. Sufferers of each of these, who are keen to find a natural solution to their health problems, try out James's remedies\n\n3)  Trees \nThird episode of the six-part series exploring plant-based natural remedies and beauty treatments. Ethnobotanist James Wong focuses on trees. His recipes for natural tree remedies include a soothing gel for varicose veins made from conkers, a fragrant cologne made from pine, a lotion to tackle head lice and a traditional tea which could help improve memory function. It is a fascinating mix of gardening, science and history, and the volunteers who try James's remedies find out if they can actually help.\n\n4)  Herbs \nMost people use herbs to give food a bit of extra taste and flavour, but in this episode, ethnobotanist James Wong explores their more traditional use in helping treat a range of minor everyday ailments, from cold sores and insect bites to bad breath. Sufferers try them out to see if these natural remedies help relieve their symptoms. James also uses peppermint to whip up a fragrant homemade body scrub.\n\n5)  Roots \nJames Wong focuses on what he considers the unsung heroes of the plant world - roots.
