This book examines these conventional elements and their interactions with mechatronic systems within the context of driving dynamics. Chassis fundamentals and design are described in the initial chapters, followed by a practical examination of driving dynamics and detailed descriptions and explanations of modern chassis components. A separate section is devoted to axles and the processes used during axle development. This first English edition features a number of improvements over the latest German edition, including revised illustrations and several updates in the text and list of references. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 591 pages\n# Publisher: Vieweg and Teubner (November 1, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3834809942\n# ISBN-13: 978-3834809940","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d7117c1ac80d61a9b47c335c52f7714a0a97b9","amp;dn":"Chassis+Handbook+%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52d7117c1ac80d61a9b47c335c52f7714a0a97b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,215,17,124,26,200,13,97,169,180,124,51,92,82,247,113,74,10,151,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
