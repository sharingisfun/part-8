With \n\n\nAjax, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server \n\nasynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior \n\nof the existing page. Data is usually retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object.\n\n Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used instead), and \n\nthe requests do not need to be asynchronous. Ajax is not a single technology, but a \n\ngroup of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style \n\ninformation. The DOM is accessed with javascript to dynamically display, and to allow \n\nthe user to interact with the information presented. javascript and the\n\n XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between \n\nbrowser and server to avoid full page reloads\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab54a68aa5535d6d67a7528d3306fa397a8d149","amp;dn":"AJAX+eBooks+Collection+%5BPDF%5D%5BA4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab54a68aa5535d6d67a7528d3306fa397a8d149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,181,74,104,170,85,53,214,214,122,117,40,211,48,111,163,151,168,209,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
