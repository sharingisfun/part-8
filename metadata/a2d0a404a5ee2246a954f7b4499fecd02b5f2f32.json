She also explores the ambiguous moral implications inherent in this kind of warfare: Are these nefarious forms of weaponry ingenious or cowardly? Admirable or reprehensible?\n\n\nWith the news full of talk about bioterrorism and chemical weapons, Mayor's exploration of the origins of biological and unethical warfare is an attention-grabber that follows through with fascinating illustrative episodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d0a404a5ee2246a954f7b4499fecd02b5f2f32","amp;dn":"Greek+Fire%2C+Poison+Arrows+%26amp%3B+Scorpion+Bombs%3A+Biological+and+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d0a404a5ee2246a954f7b4499fecd02b5f2f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,208,164,4,165,238,34,70,169,84,247,180,73,159,236,208,43,95,47,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
