It is organized by (Hebrew) alphabetical order of three letter roots. It was based on the Hebrew-German lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius, translated by Edward Robinson. The chief editor was Francis Brown, with the co-operation of Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles Augustus Briggs, hence the name Brownâ€“Driverâ€“Briggs. Some modern printings have added the Strong's reference numbers for Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic words.\r\n\r\nRenowned semitists Jo Ann Hackett and John Huehnergard are currently in the process of creating a revision of BDB that incorporates contemporary scholarship...\r\n\r\n&quot;Contemporary scholarship&quot; means changing stuff they have no business changing.\r\n\r\nThose who know the truth, are truly free.
