However, it proves too successful with much more money seized than anticipated with Trench's forces not stopping the getaway. Complicating things still more, Stigman turns out to be a Naval Intelligence agent who shoots Trench and takes the money. The interservice debacle suddenly finds Trench and Stigman in a bloody web of corrupt clandestine rivalries as they are hunted, blackmailed and isolated for the money on both sides of the law. Now, the fugitives must work together to find a way out of this situation with no one to turn to but themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852eff0aeb5df03efa5e54158a668551da49ba92","amp;dn":"2.Guns.2013.720p.BRRiP.XViD.AC3-LEGi0N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852eff0aeb5df03efa5e54158a668551da49ba92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,46,255,10,235,93,240,62,250,94,84,21,138,102,133,81,218,73,186,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
