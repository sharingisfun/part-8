It told the stories of pioneers travelling through the unsettled territories to reach California. Along the way they encountered &quot;wild&quot; Indians, cattle rustlers, con men, blizzards in the mountains, running out of water in the desert and every other hazard you can imagine. The series also often explored the motivations that caused average people to leave civilization for the unknown lives they would find in the Western United States! \n\n\nThe Wagon Train TV show was not only popular with audiences. Actors and actresses were very easy to get as guest stars. Here's a list of just a few: Eddie Albert, Dan Blocker, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef, Chuck Connors, Lou Costello, Bette Davis, Bruce Dern, Rhonda Fleming, Sterling Hayden, Lee Marvin, Martin Milner, Ricardo Montalban, Agnes Moorehead, Leonard Nimoy, Leslie Nielsen, Ryan O'Neal, Cliff Robertson, Cesar Romero, Mickey Rooney, Barbara Stanwyck, Dean Stockwell, Robert Vaughn, Shelley Winters, James Whitmore and Keenan Wynn!\n\nOne reason that big stars were willing to appear on Wagon Train was that the storylines often made them the main character. The regular cast members were often delegated to supporting roles while the guest-star became the main focus of the show.\n\n\n\n\nWard Bond .......... Major Seth Adams\nJohn McIntire ......
