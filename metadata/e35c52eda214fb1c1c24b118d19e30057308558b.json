When his ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) announces that she's getting remarried to Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a recent arrival in town and a popular, wealthy philanthropist, Frank struggles with jealousy but feels that Rick might be a stabilizing influence for his son. When Danny begins relating unsettling stories about Rick, Frank at first chalks it up to youthful rebellion, but when Danny stridently claims to have witnessed his new stepfather committing murder, Frank's instincts tell him the story is true. As he investigates the new man in his family's life, Frank uncovers alarming facts about Rick, who's not the man he appears to be. Domestic Disturbance (2001) made headlines six months before its release when co-star Steve Buscemi, accompanied by Vaughn and screenwriter Scott Rosenberg, was stabbed and seriously injured in an after-hours bar brawl with locals near the film's North Carolina set. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 29 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35c52eda214fb1c1c24b118d19e30057308558b","amp;dn":"Domestic+Disturbance%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35c52eda214fb1c1c24b118d19e30057308558b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,92,82,237,162,20,251,28,28,36,177,24,209,158,48,5,115,8,85,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
