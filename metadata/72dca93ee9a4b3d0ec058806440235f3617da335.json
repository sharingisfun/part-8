When faced with complex situations, we have all become accustomed to looking to our leaders to set out a plan of action and blaze a path to success. Harford argues that todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenges simply cannot be tackled with ready-made solutions and expert opinion; the world has become far too unpredictable and profoundly complex. Instead, we must adapt.\n\nDeftly weaving together psychology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, physics, and economics, along with the compelling story of hard-won lessons learned in the field, Harford makes a passionate case for the importance of adaptive trial and error in tackling issues such as climate change, poverty, and financial crisesÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as in fostering innovation and creativity in our business and personal lives.  \n\nTaking us from corporate boardrooms to the deserts of Iraq, Adapt clearly explains the necessary ingredients for turning failure into success. It is a breakthrough handbook for survivingÃ¢â‚¬â€and prosperingÃ¢â‚¬â€ in our complex and ever-shifting world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dca93ee9a4b3d0ec058806440235f3617da335","amp;dn":"Adapt%3A+Why+Success+Always+Starts+with+Failure+by+Tim+Harford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dca93ee9a4b3d0ec058806440235f3617da335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,220,169,62,233,164,179,208,236,5,136,6,68,2,53,243,97,125,163,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
