Although &quot;Rock Mechanics for Underground Mining&quot; addresses many of the rock mechanics issues that arise in underground mining engineering, it is not a text exclusively for mining applications. Based on extensive professional research and teaching experience, this book will provide an authoratative and comprehensive text for final year undergraduates and commencing postgraduate stydents. For profesional practitioners, not only will it be of interests to mining and geological engineers, but also to civil engineers, structural mining geologists and geophysicists as a standard work for professional reference purposes.\n\n\n# Paperback: 626 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 3rd edition (February 2, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1402020643\n# ISBN-13: 978-1402020643","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633faab47611d3996786b9d935bf807ed843b1f7","amp;dn":"Rock+Mechanics+For+Underground+Mining%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633faab47611d3996786b9d935bf807ed843b1f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,63,170,180,118,17,211,153,103,134,185,217,53,191,128,126,216,67,177,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
