On the downside, Keith&amp;#039;s formulaic tendencies can become tiresome, as it did on &quot;My List,&quot; a generic celebration of life&amp;#039;s mundane treasures. Sales notwithstanding, &quot;Beer for My Horses&quot; was no artistic landmark for Keith or duet partner Willie Nelson. By contrast, he and daughter Krystal have fun with the 1963 Inez and Charlie Foxx R&amp;B hit &quot;Mockingbird&quot; (first revived by James Taylor and Carly Simon). \n&quot;Go With Her&quot; injects a different spin into the time-honored breakup song, wittiness absent on the gimmicky &quot;Stays in Mexico.&quot; Raucous live performances of &quot;You Ain&amp;#039;t Much Fun&quot; and his debut hit, &quot;Should&amp;#039;ve Been a Cowboy,&quot; reflect his ability to rouse the faithful into the obligatory singalong.\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n?
