It can repair 'broken' stereo images which often occur on cassette tapes, vinyl and cheap CD's, which normally causes havoc when playing it on a mono system, headphones or a system which includes a stereo widener.\n\nSpecial support (not free) is included for radio stations: Much louder output levels, FM pre-emphasis, stereo coding and RDS coding for FM stations, and protection of highs against distortion caused by lossy compression for web radio stations. The processing latency can be reduced as low as 12 ms, at the cost of reduced fidelity. At the maximum quality the processing latency is 93 ms.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nPLEASE, FOLLOW THE INCLUDED INSTRUCTIONS to have a full registered and working\n\nnew (27 Jul 2014) AMAZING Stereo Tool !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d91b7fdaf71788e64eb7e1ea92035065b8aad5","amp;dn":"Stereo+Tool+7.50+-+x32%2Fx64+%2B+dsp+-+keygen+REPT+-+Full+registered","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d91b7fdaf71788e64eb7e1ea92035065b8aad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,217,27,127,218,247,23,136,230,78,183,225,234,146,3,80,101,184,170,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
