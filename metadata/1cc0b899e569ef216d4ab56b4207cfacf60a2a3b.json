All are fully annotated and are based on documentary evidence from a wide range of sources.\n\nThe atlas traces each phase of the Holocaust, beginning with the anti-Semitic violence of prewar Germany and leading to the German conquest of countries in which the Jews had lived for centuries. Presented in chronological order, the maps document in compelling detail, month by month and week by week, the story of the Holocaust, from the spread of the early random killings of Jews and their systematic mass expulsion from thousands of towns and villages to the establishment of ghettos and the setting up of the death camps. The atlas ends with the death marches and executions in the final days of the Allied liberation. Also shown on the maps are more than two hundred acts of resistance and revolt, as well as areas of Jewish partisan activity and other avenues of escape and rescue. Many maps tell the stories of hundreds of children deported to their deaths. Others bear witness to individuals active in revolt and tell moving sagas of their courage and defiance. \n\n\nAbout the author:\nSir Martin Gilbert is a leading British historian and the author of more than eighty books. Specializing in 20th century history, he is also the official biographer of Winston Churchill and has written an eight-volume biography of the war leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.\n\nBorn in London in 1936, Martin Gilbert was evacuated to Canada with his family at the beginning of World War II as part of the British governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to protect children from the brutal bombings of the Luftwaffe. He was made a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1962. He is the author of several definitive historical works examining the Holocaust, the First and Second World Wars, and the history of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1990, Gilbert was designated a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and was awarded a Knighthood in 1995. Oxford University awarded him a Doctorate in 1999. Today, he is a sought-after speaker on Churchill, Jewish history, and the history of the 20th century, and he travels frequently to lecture at colleges, universities, and organizations around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cc0b899e569ef216d4ab56b4207cfacf60a2a3b","amp;dn":"The+Atlas+of+the+Holocaust+-+Martin+Gilbert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cc0b899e569ef216d4ab56b4207cfacf60a2a3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,192,184,153,229,105,239,33,109,74,181,107,66,7,207,172,246,10,42,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
