It was not easy to transform it into a movie while remaining faithful to the play, but there are many rewards for the patient viewer. The score by Mikis Theodorakis (Zorba the Greek) fits the story beautifully, and the film's re-creation of the ancient Mediterranean is memorable. Finally, the original play, despite its great age, has what are still considered among the finest roles ever written for women. The story concerns the trials and tribulations of the women of Troy at the time of Greek conquest and the truth and chilling power of the curses they hurl at their captors, who have slain every male of their nation, including the infants. Particularly notable is the performance of Irene Papas as Helen, a woman of infinite guile, whose abduction by Paris led to the whole debacle in the first place. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067881/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067881/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-67881/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-67881/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nMihalis Kakogiannis\n\n\n\n        Katharine Hepburn\t ... \tHecuba\n\n\tVanessa Redgrave\t... \tAndromache\n\tGeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve Bujold\t... \tCassandra\n\tIrene Papas\t... \tHelen\n\tPatrick Magee\t... \tMenelaus\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:46:11\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x480  1.50:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1062 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,10 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9ac92a69ffee8111618654ad4f7a0dcf1b4736","amp;dn":"The+Trojan+Women+%281971%29+Katharine+Hepburn++Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9ac92a69ffee8111618654ad4f7a0dcf1b4736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,154,201,42,105,255,238,129,17,97,134,84,173,79,122,13,207,27,71,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
