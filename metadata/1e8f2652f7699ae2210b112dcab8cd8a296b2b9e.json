It can also serve as a one-semester introductory course at the beginning graduate level, as a useful precursor to a more serious study of CFD in advanced books. It is presented in a very readable, informal, enjoyable style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8f2652f7699ae2210b112dcab8cd8a296b2b9e","amp;dn":"Computational+Fluid+Dynamics+-+The+Basics+with+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8f2652f7699ae2210b112dcab8cd8a296b2b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,143,38,82,247,105,154,226,33,11,17,45,202,184,205,138,41,107,43,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
