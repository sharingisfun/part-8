This is the record of one of the most interesting personal relationships of modern literature. Between 1913, when Yeats first called Joyces's work to Pound's attention, an 1920 there was a steady flow of letters, in which we see Pound finding publishers for Joyce, collecting money for him, defending him against censorship, even sending spare clothes. More than sixty letters from Pound to Joyce have survived, while those from Joyce to pound will be found in the Viking Press Joyce correspondence volumes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bda8d55014db00cbb3124210c9c338860173f5b","amp;dn":"The+Letters+of+Ezra+Pound+to+James+Joyce+%28160p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bda8d55014db00cbb3124210c9c338860173f5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,218,141,85,1,77,176,12,187,49,36,33,12,156,51,136,96,23,63,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
