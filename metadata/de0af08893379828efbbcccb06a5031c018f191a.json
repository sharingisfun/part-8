There are six of his books here. All are in epub and mobi format except Red Sorghum, which is a pdf.\n\nRed Sorghum is a new scan. It's not yet available in ebook form except for this pdf. It's an optimized image pdf of good quality.\n\nincludes: \n\nRed Sorghum\nBig Breasts and Wide Hips\nThe Garlic Ballads\nLife and Death Are Wearing Me Out\nThe Republic of Wine\nShifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh (short stories)\n\nFiles are calibre-ready -- just import to get full metadata added. Epubs have embedded fonts.\n\nFor android users I recommend aldiko for epub files and ebookdroid for pdf files. Ebookdroid in particular is dramatically better for pdf ebooks than any other app I've seen.\n\nFor windows users I recommend calibre (it's essential) and adobe digital editions for epub. I don't use mobi files but the kindle app will open them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de0af08893379828efbbcccb06a5031c018f191a","amp;dn":"Mo+Yan+%28Nobel+Prize+for+Literature%29+-+6+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de0af08893379828efbbcccb06a5031c018f191a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,10,240,136,147,55,152,40,239,187,204,203,6,165,3,28,1,143,25,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
