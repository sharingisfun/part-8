David Hume and Immanuel Kant put a stop to that, arguing that the knowledge gained by sense experience can never give rise to reasons for belief in God. This spell hung over philosophy until the middle of the twentieth century, when philosophers like Alvin Plantinga and Stuart Hackett began to fight back.\n\nThis book is pretty heavy reading, not for the novice. Stuart Hackett systematically picks apart the critiques of Hume and Kant. After lifting Kant's spell on whether we can know things about God, he then proceeds to give arguments for the existence of God, performing one reductio ad absurdum after another on each and every objection raised.\n\nThis book is a tour de force on the existence of God, demolishing everything that stands in its way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1332a45b1ba0ed877a1f6e466c66a63127e97c21","amp;dn":"Stuart+Hackett+-+The+Resurrection+of+Theism%3A+Prolegomena+to+Chri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1332a45b1ba0ed877a1f6e466c66a63127e97c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,50,164,91,27,160,237,135,122,31,110,70,108,102,166,49,39,233,124,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
