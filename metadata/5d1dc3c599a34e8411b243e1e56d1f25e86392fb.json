Safe, no ads, pure, non-denominational site.\n\nNow about this upload:\n\nThis is the movie about the astrologers &quot;from the east&quot;, who had &quot;seen the star of the newborn King of the Jews&quot; &quot;In the east&quot;. Probably around Chaldea/Babylon in old Sumeria, where the well taught astrologist recognizes that all interpretation of the signs and omens/warnings/announcements in the heavenly bodies movements and constellations originates from.\n\nThis guy [I think his name is Fredric A. Larson] takes the old story from the &quot;gospel of Christmas&quot; and puts it all into a rather new perspective, while explaining on the way how he got to be so obsessed with this &quot;star in the east&quot; and the &quot;Wise men from the east&quot;.\n\nIt says nowhere that they were three, and absolutely not that they were kings, like the folklore has made it; a mockery and a roadshow, more or less. Please excuse me if I offend anyone, but that is the truth.\n\nThe researcher and self-taught astrologist simply started to make investigations around the time in question, knowing that our BC/AD time-frame was off a bit, and he discovered &quot;the fault-line&quot; and where it had entered. Then he started searching..\n\nThis is a rather amazing movie, in so much that it doesn't at all, like so many Christians do, exclude the fact that there are signs made in the heavens, to signify important events in world history. Now that's Astrology.\n\nAnd it's in the Bible. It's just; so many people won't go there. The Christians because they think they're doing something wrong, the opponents of the Bible just because it's in the Bible.\n\nEither way, one is missing out big if one doesn't venture even into that, from either side of the fence, seemingly, oh, so dreaded place..\n\nThis guy makes it easier to grasp the concept from both sides of the fence..\n\nVery cool film. + the extra little clip isn't half bad either..\n\nHere's what some critics say about it. Especially one must take into consideration a former chief astronomer from NASA, and the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, or what?\n\n&quot;well-researched and reasonable&quot;\nFormer Chief of Planetary Astronomy, NASA, and Technical Editor, Sky &amp; Telescope magazine.\n\n&quot;an interesting look... at the star&quot;\nChristianity Today magazine.\n\n&quot;models the scientific method at its best&quot;\nDistinguished Professor of Old Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary.\n\n&quot;wide-ranging and insightful scholarship&quot;\nFormer Publisher and Editor, Scientific American magazine, and President, American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n&quot;...fascinating and meticulously researched. We gladly award five Doves to this exemplary program&quot;\nThe Dove Foundation.\n\nOutside link to site of the film with some more in-depth info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bethlehemstar.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bethlehemstar.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCodec: DivX 5.0\nStream bitrate: 812 kb/s\nRes: 352X288\nFramerate: 29.97\nSound-codec: mpga, mono\nSample-rate 24000 Hz\nBitrate: 32 kb/s\n\nIn other words; quite watchable without being too big..\nEnjoy!\n\nVerifire.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;166073647f707f64737b777f7a56717b777f7a3875797b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1dc3c599a34e8411b243e1e56d1f25e86392fb","amp;dn":"The+Star+Of+Bethlehem+%5B2007%5D+%5BDVDrip-DivX%5D+%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1dc3c599a34e8411b243e1e56d1f25e86392fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,29,195,197,153,163,78,132,17,178,67,225,229,109,31,37,232,99,146,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
