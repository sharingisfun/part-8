The eigth edition continues the hallmark approach of encouraging the learning of mathematics by focusing its coverage on mastering math through practice. This worktext seeks to provide carefully detailed explanations and accessible pedagogy to introduce basic mathematical skills and put the content in context. The authors use a three-pronged approach (I. Communication, II. Pattern Recognition, and III. Problem Solving) to present the material and stimulate critical thinking skills. Items such as Math Anxiety boxes, Check Yourself exercises, and Activities represent this approach and the underlying philosophy of mastering math through practice. The exercise sets have been expanded, organized, and clearly labeled. Vocational and professional-technical exercises have been added throughout. Repeated exposure to this consistent structure should help advance the studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills in relating to mathematics. The book is designed for a one-semester basic math course and is appropriate for lecture, learning center, laboratory, or self-paced courses. It is accompanied by numerous useful supplements, including McGraw-HillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s online homework management system, MathZone.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n[img]http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/62/sezgeometrymanteshgrewa.jpg[/img]\n[b][quote][color=Green]\n\nBarron's E-Z Geometry \n\nPublisher: Barron's Educational Series\nLawrence S. Leff\n2009\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0764139185\nISBN-13: 978-0764139185\nPDF \n504 pages\n17 MB\n\nKnown for many years as Barron's Easy Way Series, the new editions of these popular self-teaching titles are now Barron's E-Z Series. Brand-new cover designs reflect all new page layouts, which feature extensive two-color treatment, a fresh, modern typeface, and more graphic material than ever-- charts, graphs, diagrams, instructive line illustrations, and where appropriate, amusing cartoons. \n Meanwhile, the quality of the books' contents remains at least as high as ever. Barron's E-Z books are self-help manuals focused to improve students' grades in a wide variety of academic and practical subjects. For most subjects, the level of difficulty ranges between high school and college-101 standards. Although primarily designed as self-teaching manuals, these books are also preferred by many teachers as classroom supplements--and for some courses, as main textbooks. E-Z books review their subjects in detail, and feature both short quizzes and longer tests with answers to help students gauge their learning progress. Subject heads and key phrases are set in a second color as an easy reference aid. Barron's E-Z Geometry covers the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of geometry, with examples, exercises, and solutions throughout, plus hundreds of drawings, graphs, and tables.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594c5b9e47a7ffc3365475b46a745a627c270f36","amp;dn":"Hutchinson%27s+Basic+Mathematical+Skills+With+Geometry+%2CBarron%27s+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594c5b9e47a7ffc3365475b46a745a627c270f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,76,91,158,71,167,255,195,54,84,117,180,106,116,90,98,124,39,15,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
