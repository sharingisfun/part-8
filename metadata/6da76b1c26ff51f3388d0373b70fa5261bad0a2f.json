Building on success of its award-winning preceding edition, the second edition features new chapters on embryonic and iPS cells and stem cells in veterinary science and medicine. It contains major revisions on cancer stem cells to include new culture models, additional interviews with leaders in progenitor cells, engineered eye tissue, and xeno organs from stem cells, as well as new information on &quot;organs on chips&quot; and adult progenitor cells.\n\nIn the past decades our understanding of stem cell biology has increased tremendously. Many types of stem cells have been discovered in tissues that everyone presumed were unable to regenerate in adults, the heart and the brain in particular. There is vast interest in stem cells from biologists and clinicians who see the potential for regenerative medicine and future treatments for chronic diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, and spinal cord lesions, based on the use of stem cells; and from entrepreneurs in biotechnology who expect new commercial applications ranging from drug discovery to transplantation therapies.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Explains in straightforward, non-specialist language the basic biology of stem cells and their applications in modern medicine and future therapy\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes extensive coverage of adult and embryonic stem cells both historically and in contemporary practice\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Richly illustrated to assist in understanding how research is done and the current hurdles to clinical practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da76b1c26ff51f3388d0373b70fa5261bad0a2f","amp;dn":"Stem+Cells%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da76b1c26ff51f3388d0373b70fa5261bad0a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,167,107,28,38,255,81,243,56,141,3,115,183,15,165,38,27,173,10,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
