Due to the ever-increasing complexity and size of today's data sets, a new term, data mining, was created to describe the indirect, automatic data analysis techniques that utilize more complex and sophisticated tools than those which analysts used in the past to do mere data analysis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345efca69d2aeaf6cbd7019e16023d4f3a956ee8","amp;dn":"Data+Mining%3A+Concepts%2C+Models%2C+Methods%2C+and+Algorithms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345efca69d2aeaf6cbd7019e16023d4f3a956ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,94,252,166,157,42,234,246,203,215,1,158,22,2,61,79,58,149,110,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
