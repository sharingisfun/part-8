These histories and accounts of visitations and subsequent mixed-blood, alien-human races comprise the bulk of the world's myths, legends, religions, and superstitions.\nThe Rise and Fall of the Nephilim examines:\nElohim and the Bene Ha Elohim--God and the Sons of God\nThe Watchers: UFOs, extraterrestrials, angels, infiltrators, and impregnators\nBiblical and apocryphal sources from Enoch to Moses\nThe role of the Fae, Elves, Elementals, and ancient gods\nWhat if the old spiritualities and religions weren't just legends?\nWhat if there was something living and breathing beneath the surface, a tangible interlinking of religious thought and spirituality, science and myth, inter-dimensionality and cold, hard fact?\nThe Nephilim walked among us... and still do today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb15ffa89c1f1cf1bbf132f7fbf6657242461b2","amp;dn":"The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Nephilim+-+Scott+Alan+Roberts.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb15ffa89c1f1cf1bbf132f7fbf6657242461b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,177,95,250,137,193,241,207,27,191,19,47,127,191,102,87,36,36,97,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
