Now, from the medieval fortified cities of Europe to the holy lands of the Middle East and from a secret pirate island in the Indian ocean to America's first great cities, renowned underwater explorer Barry Clifford and historian Scott Wolter are unearthing new evidence in an attempt to find hidden links between two of history's most legendary sects, separated by 500 years: the medieval Knights Templar and 17th century pirates. What they learn may very well alter the course of history and lead them to treasure that's been buried for centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Templar Connection \r\nA priceless relic unearthed on a shipwreck in Madagascar launches dive expert Barry Clifford and historian Scott Wolter on a world-wide investigation to find out if there's a link between two of history's most legendary sects-17th century pirates and the medieval Knights Templar.\r\n\r\n2)  The Great Adventure \r\nScott follows the trail of the legendary Knights Templar to Portugal, where he learns some stunning new information that breaks the investigation wide open. Meanwhile, in Madagascar, Barry Clifford switches the team's focus to a wreck he believes is Captain Kidd's warship and makes a groundbreaking discovery.\r\n\r\n3)  The Case of Captain Kidd \r\nBarry and Scott learn the meaning behind one of the symbols on the prized metal ingot they believe once belonged to Captain Kidd, leading them one step closer to a Templar-Pirate connection-and finding lost treasure.\r\n\r\n4)  Forgotten Fortress \r\nScott gets his hands on a piece of Captain's Kidd's treasure, launching him to Madagascar, where the trail leads him to an ancient Templar fortress that holds valuable clues. Just up the coast, in Pirate Bay, Barry's team discovers a new shipwreck they believe might be a Templar vessel.\r\n\r\n5)  The Flaming Cross \r\nThe Templar-Pirate trail leads Scott to the West Coast of India, where he makes an extraordinary find, leading Barry to investigate a tiny island that may conceal the richest Templar treasure of all-the Flaming Cross of Goa.\r\n\r\n6)  Treasure Island \r\nAs Barry's team take one final shot at digging up lost Templar treasure, Scott finds an important relic that just may be the missing link in the Templar-Pirate connection.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1d/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Pirate-Treasure-of-the-Knights-Templar-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3197 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 42mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 956 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.history.com/shows/pirate-treasure-of-the-knights-templar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9570f5a8b6bccf5e486afc88bb91439284c9b47a","amp;dn":"Pirate+Treasure+of+the+Knights+Templar+5of6+The+Flaming+Cross+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9570f5a8b6bccf5e486afc88bb91439284c9b47a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,112,245,168,182,188,207,94,72,106,252,136,187,145,67,146,132,201,180,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
