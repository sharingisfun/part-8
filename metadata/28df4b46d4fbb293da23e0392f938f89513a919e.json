This was where, in 1963, South African police arrested 19 members of the African National Congress, the underground organisation run by the already imprisoned Nelson Mandela, which sought to \noverthrow the ruling apartheid government. From firsthand experience of growing up in the heartland of apartheid South Africa is therefore born Rivonia, an album of 11 stories inspired by MacNeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homeland. The personal nature of these stories lends the record an extra gravitas.\nThis isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first time Dear Reader has edged into concept album territory. Previous album Idealistic Animals dealt with MacNeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loss of faith and splintering of the group as a duo with producer/bass player Darryl Torr and the result was a pleasant-if-inessential alternative twee pop record. Similarly, Rivonia is deeply personalised but the lyricsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ subject matter is far weightier; Ã¢â‚¬Å“What does it mean? The thumbs are blue and the ballots are green/Nancy and Sarah/Are singing Ã¢â‚¬ËœHosannaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢... what does it mean for the future?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she sings on Ã¢â‚¬â„¢27.04.1994Ã¢â‚¬â„¢, recalling South AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first mixed race elections on that day. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœThey Took Them AwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ MacNeil recalls (perhaps givendisingenuously, given that in pictures she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look old enough to have been at school back then) that day in 1963: White and black together sat/I just stood and stared/How was I to know what it all meant?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.Still, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never been one to place a huge amount of importance on lyrics; as Jarvis Cocker once wrote, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not poetry but merely part of the song. Musically thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some evolution here from Dear ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous work but it remains unapologetically twee enough that the album art should have been an Instagrammed picture of Zooey Deschanel hanging out in a coffee-cum-vintage-clothing shop on the set of a remake of AmÃƒÂ©lie. The vocals are perhaps a little too sugar-coated to carry the import of the era in history MacNeil is singing about, but then this can probably be excused given the personal nature of the songs. More interesting is the way vocal harmonies are used \non the likes of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDown Under, MiningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as augmentation for the rhythm section. Elsewhere though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the pianos, the horns and the accordions you kind of expect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28df4b46d4fbb293da23e0392f938f89513a919e","amp;dn":"Dear+Reader+-+Rivonia+%5B2013%5D%5BWEB%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28df4b46d4fbb293da23e0392f938f89513a919e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,223,75,70,212,251,178,147,218,35,224,57,47,147,143,137,81,58,145,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
