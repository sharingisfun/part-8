Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club, which\r\nwas written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, Sheryl Crow\r\nwas entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one\r\ncollaborator. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana\r\nThe album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and moral and ethical\r\nissues, while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock\r\ncountry, and folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n\r\n1 - Maybe Angels [04:54]\r\n2 - A Change Would Do You Good [03:49]\r\n3 - Home [04:50]\r\n4 - Sweet Rosalyn [03:59]\r\n5 - If It Makes You Happy [05:23]\r\n6 - Redemption Day [04:26]\r\n7 - Hard To Make A Stand [03:07]\r\n8 - Everyday Is a Winding Road [04:17]\r\n9 - Love Is a Good Thing [04:42]\r\n10 - Oh Marie [03:31]\r\n11 - Superstar [04:57]\r\n12 - The Book [04:44]\r\n13 - Ordinary Morning [03:58]\r\n14 - Sad Sad World [04:07]\r\n15 - Hard to Make a Stand (alternative version)[03:30]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\n\r\n1 - If It Makes You Happy [05:34]\r\n2 - Leaving Las Vegas [06:43]\r\n3 - Hard To Make A Stand [04:23]\r\n4 - Can't Cry Anymore [05:32]\r\n5 - Everyday Is A Winding Road [04:59]\r\n6 - On The Outside [07:56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Sheryl Crow\r\nGenre: Pop / Rock / Folk Rock\r\nAlbum Release Year: 2009\r\nNumber of Tracks: 21\r\nTotal Duration: 1:39:32.987\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 855 kbps[Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nChecksums Files: Made with Traders Little Helper\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size: 613 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a247fe5562c109f67b17dc00f8e52a07b6b9166f","amp;dn":"Sheryl+Crow+-+Sheryl+Crow+1996+Special+Edition+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a247fe5562c109f67b17dc00f8e52a07b6b9166f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,71,254,85,98,193,9,246,123,23,220,0,248,229,42,7,182,185,22,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
