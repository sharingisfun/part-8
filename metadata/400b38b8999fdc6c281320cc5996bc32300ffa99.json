Fortunately, 20 years earlier, nations across the world started to use recovered extraterrestrial technology to develop an immense defense program. When the alien invaders attack with unprecedented force, the U.S. president, teams of scientists and brave fighter pilots spring into action to save the planet from a seemingly invincible enemy.\r\nInitial release: June 22, 2016 (Philippines)\r\nDirector: Roland Emmerich\r\nFilm series: Independence Day film series\r\nBudget: 165 million USD\r\nDistributed by: 20th Century Fox\r\n\r\nhad this amazing source for few days, was waiting on TC but damnâ€¦â€¦ anyways let me say the following words firstâ€¦.\r\n\r\nSource was good , but had few issues, took almost 24hrs to fix them. had to cut video in multiple parts and fix them separately. no movements, or camera shacking, a very minor autofocus but nothing big, had 2min of little jitter but nothing biggy most of ya wont even notice. its CAM after allâ€¦\r\nstable the colors, stable the noise, bright, rgb, contrast, sharp etcâ€¦.\r\nthen synced our Sweet Digital Audio to finish video.. came out perfect for HD-TS. Enjoy the FINE CPG Release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400b38b8999fdc6c281320cc5996bc32300ffa99","amp;dn":"Independence+Day+Resurgence+2016+HDTS+x264+AC3-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400b38b8999fdc6c281320cc5996bc32300ffa99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,11,56,184,153,159,220,108,40,19,32,204,89,150,188,50,48,15,250,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
