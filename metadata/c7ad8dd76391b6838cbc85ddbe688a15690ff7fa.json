She's just arrived in the tiny town of Daily, Texas, to arrange a surprise &quot;reunion concert&quot; for hometown finalist Amber Amberson. Only it turns out everyone in town seems to know the secret. And paparazzi are arriving. And word from Hollywood is that Amber has disappeared with a &quot;bad boy&quot; actor. Can anything go right in this tumbleweed town?\r\nImagene Doll loves her town of Daily, Texas, but things are lonelier without her beloved husband. Life seems dull. At least until that fancy-dressed woman pulls into town, looking terrified and glamorous all at once. Soon life's not the least bit boring as Imagene--and the rest of Daily--find themselves at the center of a media maelstrom...with a young girl's future on the line","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ad8dd76391b6838cbc85ddbe688a15690ff7fa","amp;dn":"Lisa+Wingate-Talk+of+the+Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ad8dd76391b6838cbc85ddbe688a15690ff7fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,173,141,215,99,145,182,131,140,188,133,221,190,104,138,21,105,15,247,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
