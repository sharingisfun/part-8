The major focus is on the engineering aspects of extraction with organic and supercritical solvents, ionic liquids or surfactant solutions, and is supplemented by aspects of both up- and downstream processing, biotransformation, as well as a survey of typical products in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Chapters on market developments, economic considerations and regulations requirements give the reader the complete picture of the field. Authored by experts from leading industrial and academic institutions, this is essential reading for the hands-on scientist and office manager alike.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cfd401fe8cbc075ff362c19a16994e70ed2b979","amp;dn":"Industrial+Scale+Natural+Products+Extraction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cfd401fe8cbc075ff362c19a16994e70ed2b979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,253,64,31,232,203,192,117,255,54,44,25,161,105,148,231,14,210,185,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
