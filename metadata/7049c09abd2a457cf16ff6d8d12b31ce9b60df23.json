His performances on record and live are always a rich and beautiful experience.

A great live date that shows Frahm in fine form with marvelous line up including Kurt Rosenwinkel, Joe Martin and Otis Brown III and featuring five Frahm original compositions.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Short Rack\n 02 - A Little Extra\n 03 - What's Your Beat?\n 04 - Song For Mom\n 05 - Chelsea Bridge\n 06 - Alert\n 07 - Steeplechase\n\nMusicians:\n Joel Frahm - tenor sax\n Kurt Rosenwinkel - guitar\n Joe Martin - trumpet\n Otis Brown III - drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7049c09abd2a457cf16ff6d8d12b31ce9b60df23","amp;dn":"Joel+Frahm+Quartet+-+Live+At+Smalls+%282013%29+%5BHDTracks+24-88%2C2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7049c09abd2a457cf16ff6d8d12b31ce9b60df23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,73,192,154,189,42,69,124,241,111,246,216,209,43,49,206,155,96,223,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
