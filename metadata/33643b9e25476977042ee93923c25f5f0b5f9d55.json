Non-fans, though, will find the album fantastically\nbland, and be bemused by O'Donoghue's party trick, which is rapping. He\nembellishes several songs with a sweary American accent, adding mild\nembarrassment to songs that were trundling along effectively. (A bit of sleepy\nrhyming from Voice co-judge will.i.am adds little to Hall of Fame, either.)\nO'Donoghue's real metier is lyrics: he's a striking and emotional storyteller\n(&quot;Would you pat me on the back or would you criticise me?&quot; he asks his late\nfather on If You Could See Me Now), and it makes #3 listenable.\n\nThis is the Best Buy Deluxe Edition containing bonus tracks 13 &amp; 14.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33643b9e25476977042ee93923c25f5f0b5f9d55","amp;dn":"The_Script-3-%28Deluxe_Edition%29-2012-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33643b9e25476977042ee93923c25f5f0b5f9d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,100,59,158,37,71,105,119,4,46,233,57,35,194,95,95,11,95,157,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
