The backyard chicken revolution has coops popping up in neighborhoods all over. Home-raised chickens provide a great source of superior, organic eggs that are as close as your backyard. Chickens also make good pets and provide free fertilizerÃ¢â‚¬â€and lots of fun. Backyard Chickens Guide offers plans and photos for 16 custom coops built by real chicken owners, (including three portable designs known as tractors). Read their stories and learn from their experiences, then head out to the backyard to start your own flock\n\n\nBy Members of Backyard Chickens.com\nPublished by Betterway Home in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 192 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8318fe519c53537d4a534db17d19566ee8f1bf04","amp;dn":"Backyard+Chickens%27+Guide+to+Coops+and+Tractors%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8318fe519c53537d4a534db17d19566ee8f1bf04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,24,254,81,156,83,83,125,74,83,77,177,125,25,86,110,232,241,191,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
