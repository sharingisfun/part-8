In addition to the usual concert staples, Springsteen and the E Street Band spotlighted several songs from The River that would rarely be played on subsequent tours, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fade Away,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Price You PayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wreck on the Highway.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Price You PayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contains a different third verse from the studio version. Nassau Night had also gained fame among Springsteen bootleg collectors as the longest show in his history.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n SET ONE\n 01 - Night\n 02 - Prove It All Night\n 03 - Spirit in the Night\n 04 - Darkness On The Edge Of Town\n 05 - Independence Day\n 06 - Who'll Stop The Rain?\n 07 - This Land Is Your Land\n 08 - Promised Land\n 09 - Out in the Street\n 10 - Racing in the Street\n 11 - The River\n 12 - Badlands\n 13 - Thunder Road\n\n\n\n SET TWO\n 01 - Cadillac Ranch\n 02 - Sherry Darling\n 03 - Hungry Heart\n 04 - Merry Christmas, Baby\n 05 - Fire\n 06 - Candy's Room\n 07 - Because the Night\n 08 - 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\n 09 - Rendezvous\n 10 - Fade Away\n 11 - The Price You Pay\n 12 - Wreck On The Highway\n 13 - Two Hearts\n 14 - Ramrod\n 15 - You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\n\n\n ENCORES\n 01 - Held Up Without A Gun\n 02 - In the Midnight Hour\n 03 - Auld Lang Syne\n 04 - Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\n 05 - Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\n 06 - Jungleland\n 07 - Born to Run\n 08 - Detroit Medley\n 09 - Twist and Shout\n 10 - Raise Your Hand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d38b8f980324a80c9f534745c469fba4633b1fa8","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Nassau+Coliseum%2C+NY+1980+%282015%29+%5B192-24%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d38b8f980324a80c9f534745c469fba4633b1fa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,139,143,152,3,36,168,12,159,83,71,69,196,105,251,164,99,59,31,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
