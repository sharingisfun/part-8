The classic synthesizer parts for modulation are LFOs and Envelopes. The ÃƒÂ«human inputÃƒÂ­ is the keyboard we play and controllers like pitch bend or modulation wheel. A XY pad is perfect for the human input, but it controls only the filter and volume... We found this to be too limited. We wanted also to control the ÃƒÂ«harmonicsÃƒÂ­ of the oscillator...changing the waveform using the XY pad.\n\nOut of this idea, Blade was born...\n\nAt the heart of BLADE, lies the Harmolator. This special oscillator system uses 9 global controls which change the harmonic content (partials) of the waveform. The Harmolator allows oscillator spreading, fattening the sound and also square / sine wave sub-oscillator. What's more, the sound can be modified further by the 21 per-voice distortions types and 14 filter types.Blade offers total control of the sound over time using an array of different modulation controls. The most significant of Blade is the central XY screen. Here you can either alter things directly by moving the cursor around, or you can record paths which can be replayed.The recorded path can be looped, bi-directional looped and tempo based as well. Even the speed of the XY recording can be modulated for dynamic changes! So the XY pad is also an incredibly advanced ÃƒÂ¬human inputÃƒÂ® modulation source.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/blade.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.robpapen.com/blade.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nImportant Note: thx R2R for the permission of this release and respect to this very hard working team.\n\nbe fair, buy after try\ndon`t make money with warzed apps\nsupport developer you like, we do this too\n\nGreetz\nall our friends in reallife\n--= TEAM Xdb 2012 =--\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5741397dd5907298624488c7bf763e1239d82c50","amp;dn":"Rob+Papen+-+Blade+v1.0c+-+OS+X+-Xdb+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5741397dd5907298624488c7bf763e1239d82c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,65,57,125,213,144,114,152,98,68,136,199,191,118,62,18,57,216,44,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
