It is devoted to the analysis of dynamical systems and combines features of a detailed introductory textbook with that of a reference source. The book contains many examples and figures illustrating the text which help to bring out the intuitive ideas behind the mathematical constructions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d81a90caf98fb120a111fd0793ed50b23f18e40","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Systems+Theory+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d81a90caf98fb120a111fd0793ed50b23f18e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,129,169,12,175,152,251,18,10,17,31,208,121,62,213,11,35,241,142,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
