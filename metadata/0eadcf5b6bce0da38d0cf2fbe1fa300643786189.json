He operated in environments where, if captured, he would have been executed. Dunn was trained in all aspects of intelligence collection, covert deployment, small arms, explosives, military unarmed combat, surveillance, and infiltration.\n\nSpycatcher series:\n\nSpycatcher (#1): intelligence agent Will CochraneÃ¢â‚¬â€working on a joint covert mission for the CIA and MI6Ã¢â‚¬â€sets out to capture a brilliant and ruthless Iranian spy. Timely and gripping, Spycatcher rockets the reader into a shadowy world of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and holds them in an iron grip until the last pulse-pounding page is turned.\n\nSentinel (#2): In Sentinel, Dunn brings back Agent Will CochraneÃ¢â‚¬â€whom Kirkus Reviews calls, Ã¢â‚¬Å“a Nietzschean hero who looks poised to give Lee ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jack Reacher a run for his readersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€and sends him to Avacha Bay in eastern Russia, where he must infiltrate a top-secret submarine base, decode a cryptic message from a deep undercover operative, and quite possibly prevent a devastating war. Espionage fiction fans who regularly devour the works of Daniel Silva, Robert Ludlum, Alex Berenson, Ted Bell, Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, and Barry Eisler will discover thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a new ace on the international thriller scene.\n\nSlingshot (#3): In Slingshot, Cochrane is ordered to recover a mysterious document stolen by a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SRV) traitor working for a former high-ranking East German Stasi officer. The officer, years before, had instigated a secret pact between Russian and U.S. generals. The agreement stipulated that should it be broken, an assassin would immediately be set loose after an unknown target.\n\nThe SRV has sent their own version of Cochrane, a cold-blooded, brilliant operative, to retrieve the document, pitting spycatcher against spycatcher.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
