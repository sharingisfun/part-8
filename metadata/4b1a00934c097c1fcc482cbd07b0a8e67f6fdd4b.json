The good news is TPB's brother site Demonoid is coming back, where this torrent came originally came from before getting shutdown due to various legal issues. \n\n\nPLEASE SEED. Don't argue with others in the comments section below. We all hold different beliefs but be loving and show them that Christians do care. \n\nMy hope is that this torrent will get seeded and people may deeper their relationship with Jesus Christ and if they don't know Him that they will get to know Him and come to accept Him as Lord and Savior. God Bless.\n\n\nJOHN 3:16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b1a00934c097c1fcc482cbd07b0a8e67f6fdd4b","amp;dn":"PC+STUDY+BIBLE+5F+UPDATE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b1a00934c097c1fcc482cbd07b0a8e67f6fdd4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,26,0,147,76,9,124,31,204,72,44,189,7,176,168,230,127,111,221,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
