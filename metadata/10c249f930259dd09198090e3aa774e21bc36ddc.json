The premise is that earth has been invaded by multiple, alternate realities--worlds with different natural laws, such as magic working but advanced technology not doing so. The characters play Storm Knights, people gifted with the ability to bend reality, so that they can apply the natural laws of their home universe to the alternate ones as they fight the invasion of earth. The result is an unusual multi-genre RPG.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c249f930259dd09198090e3aa774e21bc36ddc","amp;dn":"TORG+%28West+End+Games+RPG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c249f930259dd09198090e3aa774e21bc36ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,194,73,249,48,37,157,208,145,152,9,14,58,167,116,226,27,195,109,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
