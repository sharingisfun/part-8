He lost not only the battle but his lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€and the lives of his entire cavalry. Ã¢â‚¬Å“CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last StandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a spectacular defeat that shocked the country and grew quickly into a legend that has reverberated in our national consciousness to this day. \n\nPulitzer Prize winner Larry McMurtry has long been fascinated by the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boy GeneralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his rightful place in history. In Custer, he delivers an expansive, agile, and clear-eyed reassessment of the iconic generalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and legacyÃ¢â‚¬â€how the legend was born, the ways in which it evolved, what it has meantÃ¢â‚¬â€told against the broad sweep of the American narrative. We see Custer in all his contradictions and complexity as the perpetually restless man with a difficult marriage, a hunger for glory, and an unwavering confidence in his abilities. \n\nMcMurtry explores how the numerous controversies that grew out of the Little Bighorn combined with a perfect storm of technological developmentsÃ¢â‚¬â€the railroad, the camera, and the telegraphÃ¢â‚¬â€to fan the flames of his legend. He shows how CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Libbie, worked for decades after his death to portray Major Marcus Reno as the cause of the disaster of the Little Bighorn, and how Buffalo Bill Cody, who ended his Wild West Show with a valiant reenactment of CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Stand, played a pivotal role in spreading CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notoriety. \n\nWhile Custer is first and foremost an enthralling story filled with larger-than-life charactersÃ¢â‚¬â€Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, William J. Fetterman, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Red CloudÃ¢â‚¬â€McMurtry also argues that Little Bighorn should be seen as a monumental event in our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history. Like all great battles, its true meaning can be found in its impact on our politics and policy, and the epic defeat clearly signaled the end of the Indian WarsÃ¢â‚¬â€and brought to a close the great narrative of western expansion. In Custer, Larry McMurtry delivers a magisterial portrait of a complicated, misunderstood man that not only irrevocably changes our long-standing conversation about Custer, but once again redefines our understanding of the American West.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad32a06d8be86ee10ee709403fe24035ce8cb43","amp;dn":"Larry+McMurtry+-+Custer+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad32a06d8be86ee10ee709403fe24035ce8cb43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,211,42,6,216,190,134,238,16,238,112,148,3,254,36,3,92,232,203,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
