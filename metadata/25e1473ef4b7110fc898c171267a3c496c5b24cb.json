Director-screenwriter Richard Brooks&amp;#039;s 1955 adaptation of Blackboard Jungle still packs a tremendous wallop (even if it was shot mostly on the back lot). A forerunner of Rebel Without a Cause and West Side Story, this black-and-white classic--set to Bill Haley and His Comets&amp;#039; &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;--is part exposÃƒÂ©, part melodrama, part public-service announcement. &quot;It is the frankest, the toughest, the most realistic film since On the Waterfront,&quot; ballyhooed MGM at the time.\n\nGlenn Ford, at his slow-to-rile best, plays Richard Dadier, an incoming English teacher at North Manual High School. An idealist who knows how to handle himself in a dark alley, Dadier stands his ground and earns the begrudging respect of school thugs led by Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier. Anne Francis plays Ford&amp;#039;s especially vulnerable wife; Richard Kiley (later in Brooks&amp;#039;s Looking for Mr. Goodbar) is the timid math teacher with the priceless jazz-record collection; Louis Calhern and John Hoyt are among the more cynical North Manual High veterans. See if you can ID Jamie Farr and director Paul Mazursky as gang members. The film was nominated for four Oscars.\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e1473ef4b7110fc898c171267a3c496c5b24cb","amp;dn":"Blackboard+Jungle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e1473ef4b7110fc898c171267a3c496c5b24cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,225,71,62,244,183,17,15,200,152,193,113,38,122,60,73,108,91,36,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
