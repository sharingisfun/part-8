ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹ and on the same track, no less. But that's one of the nifty surprises Kid Rock pulls off on his eighth album, making strange musical bedfellows sound like kindred spirits to boot.\n\nThat also may have something to do with the presence of producer Rick Rubin, who once again demonstrates his uncanny gift for chipping away the bluster and artifice from the acts he works with, helping them sculpt their songs and performances down to what really matters.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Born free                                            [05:15]\n02.Slow my roll                                         [04:20]\n03.Care (F, martina mcbride &amp; T.I.)
