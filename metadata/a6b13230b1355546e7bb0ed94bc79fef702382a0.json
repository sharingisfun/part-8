Their first drummer was the late BjÃƒÂ¸rn Uglebjerg. He was replaced by SÃƒÂ¸ren Berlev in 1971. At the formation the guitar playing of Franz Beckerlee was inspired by Jimi Hendrix and the singing and lyrics of Larsen was inspired by Bob Dylan, while the rhythm playing of JÃƒÂ¸nsson and Berlev owed much to The Beatles. However, they would soon develop their own musical style. The pop sensibility of Kim Larsen, the artistic attitude of Franz Beckerlee and the musical competence of Wili JÃƒÂ¸nsson would prove to be a recipe for success. Gasolin's lyrics were generally written by the entire group, often with the assistance of friend Mogens Mogensen.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978, Gasolin' was the most popular rock band in Denmark. With producer Roy Thomas Baker, they released classics such as Gasolin' 3, Gas 5 and Efter endnu en dag. Their albums sound as fresh and innovative now as they did then. In that respect Gasolin' may be considered as the Danish Beatles. Each album was a landmark and like The Beatles, they broke up at the pinnacle of their success. The reasons for the split-up was the failure to break the international market and personal differences.\n\nThe Black Box was released in 2003, and contains the original seven studio albums they released between 1971 and 1977, the live album, Live sÃƒÂ¥dan and Additional tracks. The latter contains 19 songs, 18 rare and four of the songs are previously unreleased. The Black Box was a big seller and confirmed that Gasolin' is the most popular rock band in Denmark ever.
