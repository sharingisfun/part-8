In this book, former State Department officer John Marks tells the explosive story of the CIA's highly secret program of experiments in mind control. His curiosity first aroused by information on a puzzling suicide. Marks worked from thousands of pages of newly released documents as well as interviews and behavioral science studies, producing a book that 'accomplished what two Senate committees could not' (Senator Edward Kennedy).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb5e48ed1eb31cd6e15fdd4a9b4097668086cb5","amp;dn":"John+Marks+-+The+Search+For+The+Manchurian+Candidate+-+Cia+And+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb5e48ed1eb31cd6e15fdd4a9b4097668086cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,181,228,142,209,235,49,205,110,21,253,212,169,180,9,118,104,8,108,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
