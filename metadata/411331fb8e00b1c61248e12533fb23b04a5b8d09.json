The smithies break the flood.\nThe golden smithies of the Emperor!\nMarbles of the dancing floor\nBreak bitter furies of complexity,\nThose images that yet\nFresh images beget,\nThat dolphin-torn, that gong-tormented sea.Ã‚Â  \n\nThree CDs of Yeats read by Jim Norton et alia (Naxos NA226412 &amp; NA149012 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there is some duplication of the first in the latter)Ã‚Â  Kindly seed.\n\n(Go to http://www.naxosspokenwordlibrary.com/home.asp?rurl=/homepage.asp, which has a first-rate poetry list)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:411331fb8e00b1c61248e12533fb23b04a5b8d09","amp;dn":"The+Poetry+of+Yeats+-+3+-+Jim+Norton+et+alia%2C+Naxos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"411331fb8e00b1c61248e12533fb23b04a5b8d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,19,49,251,142,0,177,198,18,72,225,37,51,251,35,176,74,91,141,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
