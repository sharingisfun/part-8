This book contains all the basic information you need to know to get going with Java\nprogramming, starting with writing statements and using variables and ending with techniques for writing programs that use animation and\nplay games. Along the way, you find plenty of not-so-basic information about programming user interfaces, working with classes and\nobjects, creating web applications, and dealing with files and databases.\nYou can (and probably should, eventually) buy separate books on each of these topics. It wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long before your bookshelf is bulging\nwith 10,000 or more pages of detailed information about every imaginable nuance of Java programming. But before youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready to tackle\neach of those topics in depth, you need to get a birdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-eye picture. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what this book is about.\nAnd if you already own 10,000 pages or more of Java information, you may be overwhelmed by the amount of detail and wonder, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do I really\nneed to read 1,200 pages about JSP just to create a simple web page? And do I really need a six-pound book on Swing?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Truth is, most\n1,200-page programming books have about 200 pages of really useful information Ã¢â‚¬â€ the kind you use every day Ã¢â‚¬â€ and about 1,000 pages of\nexcruciating details that apply mostly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re writing guidance-control programs for nuclear missiles or trading systems for the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\nThe basic idea here is that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to wring out the 100-or-so most useful pages of information on these different Java programming\ntopics: setup and configuration, basic programming, object-oriented programming, programming techniques, Swing, file and database\nprogramming, web programming, and animation and game programming. Thus you get a nice, trim book.\nSo whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just getting started with Java programming or youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a seasoned pro, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found the right book.\nAbout This Book\nJava All-in-One For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a reference for all the great things (and maybe a few not-so-great things) that you may need\nto know when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re writing Java programs. You can, of course, buy a huge 1,200-page book on each of the programming topics covered in\nthis book. But then, who would carry them home from the bookstore for you? And where would you find the shelf space to store them? And\nwhen will you find the time to read them?\nIn this book, all the information you need is conveniently packaged for you in between one set of covers. And all of the information is\ncurrent for the newest release of Java, known as JDK 7. This book doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pretend to be a comprehensive reference for every detail on\nevery possible topic related to Java programming. Instead, it shows you how to get up and running fast so that you have more time to do\nthe things you really want to do. Designed using the easy-to-follow For Dummies format, this book helps you get the information you need\nwithout laboring to find it.\nJava All-in-One For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is a big book made up of nine smaller books Ã¢â‚¬â€ minibooks, if you will. Each of these minibooks\ncovers the basics of one key element of programming, such as installing Java and compiling and running programs, or using basic Java\nstatements, or using Swing to write GUI applications.\nWhenever one big thing is made up of several smaller things, confusion is always a possibility. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why this book has multiple access\npoints. At the beginning is a detailed table of contents that covers the entire book. Then each minibook begins with a minitable of\ncontents that shows you at a miniglance what chapters are included in that minibook. Useful running heads appear at the top of each page\nto point out the topic discussed on that page. And handy thumbtabs run down the side of the pages to help you find each minibook quickly.\nFinally, a comprehensive index lets you find information anywhere in the entire book.\nThis isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the kind of book you pick up and read from start to finish, as if it were a cheap novel. If I ever see you reading it at the\nbeach, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll kick sand in your face. Beaches are for reading romance novels or murder mysteries, not programming books. Although you could\nread straight through from start to finish, this book is a reference book, the kind you can pick up, open to just about any page, and\nstart reading. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to memorize anything in this book. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Ã¢â‚¬Å“need-to-knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ book: You pick it up when you need to know\nsomething. Need a reminder on the constructors for the ArrayList class? Pick up the book. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember the goofy syntax for anonymous\ninner classes? Pick up the book. After you find what you need, put the book down and get on with your life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f7a80a4f18d5db7cf05a1ed1499a5b265238f3","amp;dn":"Java+All-in-One+For+Dummies%2C+3rd+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f7a80a4f18d5db7cf05a1ed1499a5b265238f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,247,168,10,79,24,213,219,124,240,90,30,209,73,154,91,38,82,56,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
