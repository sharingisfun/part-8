The\n   former were collected in 9 and the latter in 3 trade editions, whose numbering\n   reflects the continuity. So far, so straightforward - except that the regular\n   issues were then re-collected as a 3-volume omnibus upon the series' completion,\n   which is what 3 of these releases correspond to, while the other 3 are the\n   original miniseries trades. Unfortunately, the organization of the omnibus\n   volumes does not coincide with the continuity gaps created by said miniseries,\n   which means there is no foolproof way to establish a reading order among these,\n   short of disassembling the archives. Between the modifications I made to the\n   original filenames, the 'pedia listing, and the narrative itself, I trust anyone\n   who *isn't* a fool will be able to figure it out without much trouble, though! :P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990a09fdad0e09652d8d68c5749d91e9c0987199","amp;dn":"Garth+Ennis%3A+The+Boys+-+Vol+01-12+%28of+12%7C2006-12%7CDgtl-HR%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990a09fdad0e09652d8d68c5749d91e9c0987199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,10,9,253,173,14,9,101,45,141,104,197,116,157,145,233,192,152,113,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
