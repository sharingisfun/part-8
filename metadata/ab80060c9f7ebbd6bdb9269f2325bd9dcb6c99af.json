But the newest contender in this savage arena, as demonic to behold as he is deadly to challenge, is fighting for more than just survival. His do-or-die mission, for the dark masters he serves, is to capture the ultimate weapon: an object that will enable the Sith to conquer the galaxy. \n\nBOOK DETAILS \nProgram Type: Audiobook UNABRIDGED\t\nDuration: 12 hrs and 24 mins \nNarrated by: Jonathan Davis\nAudiobook release date: January 2014\nBitrate: 36kbps\nPublisher: Random House Audio\nISBN: 0007418930\n\nMP3 is V8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab80060c9f7ebbd6bdb9269f2325bd9dcb6c99af","amp;dn":"Joe+Schreiber+-+%28Star+Wars%29+Maul+Lockdown+%5Bm4b+%26amp%3B+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab80060c9f7ebbd6bdb9269f2325bd9dcb6c99af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,128,6,12,159,126,187,214,189,185,38,159,35,37,189,157,203,108,153,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
