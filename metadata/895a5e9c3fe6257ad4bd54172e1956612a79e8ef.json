The album was produced by band member Rostam Batmanglij, with mixing assistance from Jeff Curtin and Shane Stoneback. In the United States, the album sold over 27,000 copies in the first week of its release, debuting at number 17 on the Billboard 200. In the album's 11th week in the UK chart, it peaked at number 15. The album also reached number 37 in Australia. The first single, &quot;Mansard Roof&quot;, was released on October 28, 2007. The second single, &quot;A-Punk&quot;, was released in early 2008. The album was named as the 5th best album of 2008 by Time, and as the 56th Best Album of the Decade by Rolling Stone\n\nAmazon.com Review B y Mike McGonigal - It would take a lot for Vampire Weekend's debut to rise above the stench of privileged hype that surrounds it. A bunch of kids who formed the band in their Columbia dorm room borrow wholesale from Afrobeat and angular '80s stuff, and they quickly become an online buzz band before releasing a single album? Thankfully the record, and the band, are great fun: playful, pop-wise, and smart enough to pull their shtick off with aplomb. Organ and drums are often the focal point of the music, bringing to mind a goofier, happier Clinic (if that group's record-collecting habits were more scattershot). On the excellently named (and better sounding) &quot;Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa,&quot; Vampire Weekend asks, &quot;Does it feel so unnatural / To Peter Gabriel too?,&quot; immediately disarming--with self-aware brazenness--any criticism of their pomo/postcolonialist borrowing of &quot;ethnic&quot; music. It's clear that these dudes have not only inherited the nerd-rock omnivore's mantle from the Talking Heads, they've actually and already improved upon it.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Mansard Roof\n[02] Oxford Comma\n[03] A-Punk\n[04] Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\n[05] M79\n[06] Campus\n[07] Bryn\n[08] One (Blake's Got A New Face)\n[09] I Stand Corrected\n[10] Walcott\n[11] The Kids Don't Stand A Chance\n\n\tPlay Time - H:m:s\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:34m:13s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 92mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Alternative Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 29 January 2008\nRecord Company\t&gt; XL Recordings\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.vampireweekend.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Weekend\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/v/vampireweekend.html\n&gt; http://www.bebo.com/vampireweekend\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/vampireweekend\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895a5e9c3fe6257ad4bd54172e1956612a79e8ef","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+Vampire+Weekend+-+Vampire+Weekend+92mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895a5e9c3fe6257ad4bd54172e1956612a79e8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,90,94,156,63,230,37,122,212,189,84,23,46,25,86,97,42,121,232,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
