It is, in other words, close enough to complete to perhaps invite a little bit of quibbling about what is absent -- Live Peace in Toronto could fit in nicely with this batch and there are outtakes from Menlove Ave missing but the real niggling comes with the home demo disc, which emphasizes demos and alternate takes of songs from Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, leaving behind demos of songs Lennon gave away, including Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the GreatestÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Goodnight Vienna,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which he handed over to Ringo, and songs that never made it to one of his records. Ultimately, this is nitpicking because Signature Box is handsomely produced and contains the best-sounding Lennon remasters -- remastered by the team that did the acclaimed 2009 Beatles remasters, using the original mixes, not the recent remixes -- which is enough to make this more than worthwhile for the serious Lennon fan.  \n\n\n\n\nJohn Lennon/Plastic Ono Band - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970/2014)\n FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time - 39:33 minutes | 883 MB\nStudio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Digital booklet\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Mother\n 02 - Hold On\n 03 - I Found Out\n 04 - Working Class Hero\n 05 - Isolation\n 06 - Remember\n 07 - Love\n 08 - Well Well Well\n 09 - Look At Me\n 10 - God\n 11 - My Mummy's Dead\n\nPersonnel:\n John Lennon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead and backing vocals, acoustic/electric guitars, piano/organ\n Ringo Starr Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n Klaus Voormann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n Phil Spector Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano on &quot;Love&quot;\n Billy Preston Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano on &quot;God&quot;\n Yoko Ono Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;wind&quot;\n\n.....................................................................................................................................................\n\n\nJohn Lennon - Imagine (1971/2014)\n FLAC (tracks) 24-bit/96 kHz | Time - 39:43 minutes | 905 MB\nStudio Master, Official Digital Download | Artwork: Digital booklet\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Imagine\n 02 - Crippled Inside\n 03 - Jealous Guy [feat.
