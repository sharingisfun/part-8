A must listen for Flashman fans and an insight to the origin of Flashmans character.\n\nand also interestingly.... \n\n&quot;America just didn't get it.&quot; As Fraser recalled in an interview; &quot;when Flashman appeared in the US in 1969, one-third of 40-odd critics accepted it as a genuine historical memoir. 'The most important discovery since the Boswell Papers,' is the one that haunts me still ... I was appalled ... I'd never supposed that it would fool anybody.&quot;\n\n\nplease re-seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83852e428951c2b04cc919e8cd8d199944609cdf","amp;dn":"Flashman+-+G.M.+Frazer+BBC+Interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83852e428951c2b04cc919e8cd8d199944609cdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,133,46,66,137,81,194,176,76,201,25,232,205,141,25,153,68,96,156,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
