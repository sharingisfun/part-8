The music is raw, hard-edged, and sharp (the guitars slash and cut), more like a successor to Muddy's classic 1950's sides (he rethinks a bunch '50s numbers here) than to the London Sessions, Super Blues, brass blow-outs, and psychedelic albums that he'd been doing. It's also easy to hear Muddy's heart in this release -- he fairly oozes soul out of every note he sings. The title track, &quot;Sad Letter,&quot; and &quot;Mother's Bad Luck Child&quot; are all killer tracks, and most of the rest isn't far behind, though &quot;Garbage Man&quot; is the best known of the newer tracks, thanks to subsequent covers. \n\n\nTracks:\n1.
