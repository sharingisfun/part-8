Many of the songs included here were in a terrific album released early in the 1980s, with the hit song &quot;What's Forever For&quot; propelling it up the charts. Murphey is always delightful and surprising, and from a guy who has done everything from &quot;Geronimo's Cadillac&quot; to cowboy albums, this album is a provocative turn toward more contemporary music, which may be difficult to classify, but is absolutely impossible to resist. From the opening &quot;What's Forever For&quot; to the intriguing &quot;Ring Of Truth&quot;, Murphey's songwriting, singing, and arrangement talents are wonderfully showcased, and each of the songs provides an interesting look at the nature of contemporary lives and relationships as seen by someone with common sense, an earthy appreciation for the values of the simple life, and an ardent celebrant of life.\n\nAlthough I like all the songs included here, my special favorites are &quot;Heart's In The Right Place&quot;, &quot;Lost River&quot;, and the absolutely captivating &quot;Crystal&quot;, an absorbing word picture of a man recollecting a love affair with unbelievably stunning lyrics and a lovely, memorable and artfully delivered melody. Believe me when I say this one song is worth the price of the album, and compares well to anything by James Taylor, Van Morrison, or Paul Simon. I love this album, and it is permanently installed in my new 100 CD player for my convenience. I highly recommend it.
