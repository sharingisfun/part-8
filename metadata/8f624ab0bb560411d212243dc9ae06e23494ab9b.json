It was a major hit, and won the Academy Award for Best Movie. One of the major reasons for for the success of Rocky, is the brilliant musical score by Bill Conti. Conti was nominated for best Musical Score, and Best Song (Gonna Fly Now).\n\nWhen people think of &quot;Rocky&quot;, they think of Sylvester Stallone and the trumpets introducing the classic hit, &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot;. The music brings soul and heart to the movie. Without the music, Rocky is still a good picture, but with the music, Rocky is a great movie! The music of Bill Conti energizes this movie and brands it with a unique persona and character. In a word - Billiant!\n\nThere is not a weak track on the entire album. &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; became a #1 top-40 hit in 1976, and has inspired countless millions with its upbeat thrilling souhd. But it does not end there. &quot;Going the Distance&quot; is another solid composition that grabs your soul with its gritty determination and tension. &quot;First Date&quot; and &quot;You Take My Heart Away&quot; show the tender side of the Rocky soundtrack, being the love themes of the Rocky movie.\n\nIn the top-20 of all-time musical scores, this has to rank solidly in this group. It is music that stands the test of time. I still listen to the album 30 years after its release, and find great enjoyment in it. I treasure it, and it occupies a special place in my music collection.\n\nBuy it to inspire you, buy it as music to exercise to, buy it to remember the movie - just buy it. You will love this album, guaranteed.\n\nThank you Bill Conti for creating a masterpiece.\n\n\nimage\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBill Conti - Rocky\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bill Conti\nAlbum................: Rocky\nGenre................: Stage &amp; Screen\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1976\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 53 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 253kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
