Tezuka evidences his profound grasp of the subject by contextualizing the Buddha's ideas; the emphasis is on movement, action, emotion, and conflict as the prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India, and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression. Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly. Philosophical segments are threaded into interpersonal situations with ground-breaking visual dynamism by an artist who makes sure never to lose his readers' attention.\n\nTezuka himself was a humanist rather than a Buddhist, and his magnum opus is not an attempt at propaganda. Hermann HesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel or BertolucciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film is comparable in this regard; in fact, Tezuka's approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humor.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, Books 1-4 of this were previously uploaded to TPB. I'm assuming it still works (shows three seeds), but that user is Anonymous (no toe stepping involved) so I'm going to go ahead and re-up this one as Complete. \n\nAlso, if you haven't checked this out, want to, but don't want to download a GB of books, it is still available for free online at http://manga.animea.net/buddha.html\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28315312676abcdebe0129538c63ba3ca9ae3378","amp;dn":"Buddha+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28315312676abcdebe0129538c63ba3ca9ae3378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,49,83,18,103,106,188,222,190,1,41,83,140,99,186,60,169,174,51,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
