Here's another hot top: Hot to Trot offers           \n         plenty of two-legged goofiness, too. Bob Goldthwait          \n         headlines this rambunctious romp and - as fans of            \n         Scrooged, Police Academy 2, 3 and 4 and the LP Meat          \n         Bob already know - funny is what this gifted comic           \n         is all about. Here, Goldthwait characteristically            \n         twitches, stutters and shrieks in the uproarious             \n         role of Fred, the stockbroker Don saddles up with            \n         for a sprint along Yuppiedom's high-rise fast track.         \n                                                                      \n           A cluster of thoroughbred talents is on hand as            \n         comic stablemates. Emmy Award winner Dabney Coleman          \n         (9 to 5, Tootsie) leers and sneers as the conniving          \n         stepdad who wants to squelch Fred's good fortune.            \n         Saturday Night Live's Tim Kazurinsky, Gilbert Gottfried      \n         and Mary Gross (Feds) offer their own unique styles          \n         of horsing around, all brought to a merry photo              \n         finish under the direction of Michael Dinner (Heaven         \n         Help Us, Off Beat). And Don himself, moving his lips         \n         without wires, is the happenin' horse who mouths             \n         wisecracks that Francis the Talking Mule and Mr. Ed          \n         were never hip enough to say.                                \n                                                                      \n           Listen up, party animals.

His previous performances in no less than        \n         three Police Academy movies, and his acting prowess          \n         combined with his soothing hoarse whisper, would no  n       \n         doubt help illuminate the many facets of his equestria       \n         leading man. As Don the horse they cast John Candy,          \n         frequently mistaken for a horse in real life owing to        \n         his long, lean figure. To direct this journey into the       \n         inner life of horses they chose Tim Burton, an up-and-       \n         coming star who had most recently finished directing         \n         Pee-wee's Big Adventure. He foolishly declined, opting       \n         instead to direct a piece named Beetle Juice, and no         \n         one has heard from him since. An acquintance of his,         \n         Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo, famous for his contrib-        \n         utions to the soundtracks of Teen Wolf Too and Back          \n         To School (starring Rodney Dangerfield) signed up for        \n         music writing duties however, a move which very              \n         clearly helped his career on to the multiple Oscar           \n         nominations he has since received.                           \n                                                                      \n           While this may make it sound as though creating the        \n         ultimate 80s talking horse movie was easy, that is           \n         certainly not the case. Before fitting all the pieces        \n         of this puzzle, they tried and failed numerous times.        \n         Bobcat's role was originally played by Joan Rivers,          \n         and Don was first voiced by Elliott Gould. None of           \n         them had what it took to bring out proper equine             \n         magic, nor the wit and charm of the final cast. Don's        \n         lines were rewritten entirely by future Monk creator         \n         Andy Breckman, and John Candy even threw out his             \n         rewrite, and improvised most of his dialog. This goes        \n         to show what a winning recipe talking horses are;            \n         it's not important what they say, only that they             \n         talk. With the addition of versatile Gilbert Gottfried       \n         in a bit part, and further casting of Dabney Coleman         \n         and Virginia Madsen, their vision was complete.              \n                                                                      \n           Unfortunately, the world was not quite ready for           \n         such a level of excellence in filmmaking, leading to         \n         5 Razzie nominations. Today, 23 years later, we can          \n         only look back, and marvel at the achievements of            \n         this group of people, and what they accomplished,            \n         at a moment in time when it was widely believed              \n         comedy had already reached a high point. Bobcat              \n         Goldthwait, Gilbert Gottfried, and a talking horse           \n         that knows all about the stock market - played by            \n         John Candy. It is indeed a formula of perfection.            \n                                                                      \n         Prepare to throw out everything you thought you knew         \n         about horses, and enjoy!                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751595f39e5a3c1c4af9cc89e5f161c33a91ab7a","amp;dn":"Hot.To.Trot.1988.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751595f39e5a3c1c4af9cc89e5f161c33a91ab7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,21,149,243,158,90,60,28,74,249,204,137,229,241,97,195,58,145,171,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
