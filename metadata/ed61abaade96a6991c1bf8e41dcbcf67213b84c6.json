In this friendly, thorough introduction, Erik M. Buck shows how to make the most of  Open GL ES in AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iOS environment.\n\nThis highly anticipated title focuses on modern, efficient approaches that use the newest versions of  OpenGL ES, helping you avoid the irrelevant, obsolete, and misleading techniques that litter the Internet. Buck embraces Objective-C and Cocoa Touch, showing how to leverage AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful, elegant GLKit framework to maximize your productivity, achieve tight platform integration, and deliver exceptionally polished apps.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written C or C++ code and know  object-oriented programming basics, this title  brings together everything you need to fully  master OpenGL ES graphics for iOSÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding  downloadable examples specifically designed to  jumpstart your own projects.\n\nCoverage includes\n- Understanding core OpenGL ES computer graphics concepts and iOS graphics architecture\n- Integrating Cocoa Touch with OpenGL ES to leverage the power of AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s platform\n- Creating textures from start to finish: opacity, blending, multi-texturing, and compression\n- Simulating ambient, diffuse, and specular light\n- Using transformations to render 3D geometric objects from any point of view\n- Animating scenes by controlling time through application logic\n- Partitioning data to draw expansive outdoor scenes with rolling terrain\n- Detecting and handling user interaction with 3D geometry\n- Implementing special effects ranging from skyboxes to particles and billboards\n- Systematically optimizing graphics performance\n- Understanding the essential linear algebra concepts used in computer graphics\n- Designing and constructing a complete simulation that incorporates everything youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned\n\nTable of Contents\n1.
