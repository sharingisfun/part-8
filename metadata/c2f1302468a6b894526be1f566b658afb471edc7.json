Liu Hulan is the Inspector in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ministry of Public Security whose tough style rousts wrongdoers and rubs her superiors the wrong way. Now her latest case finds her trapped between her countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distant past and her own recent history.\n\nThe case starts at a rally for a controversial cult that ends suddenly in bloodshed, and leads to the apparent murder of an American archaeologist, which officials want to keep quiet. And haunting HulanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation is the possible theft of ancient dragon bones that might alter the history of civilization itself.\n\nGetting to the bottom of ever-spiraling events, Hulan unearths more scandals, confronts more murderers, and revives tragic memories that shake her tormented marriage to its core. In the end, she solves a mystery as big, unruly, and complex as China itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f1302468a6b894526be1f566b658afb471edc7","amp;dn":"Dragon+Bones+-+Lisa+See.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f1302468a6b894526be1f566b658afb471edc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,241,48,36,104,166,184,148,82,107,225,245,102,182,88,175,180,113,237,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
