Here is what someone wrote on IMDB and I totally agree. Great movie with a fantastic rack!\n\nThis movie came out before Lynda Carter's stint in the Wonder Woman television show. It is actually quite entertaining, especially if you enjoy seeing one of the most beautiful women to grace the planet everywhere in four nude scenes. Lynda Carter simply has one of the greatest, most voluptuous bodies that I have ever seen, and that combined with her stunning eyes and smile makes the movie all the more enjoyable. It is about a good girl who gets mixed up with a bad guy. Marjoe doesn't really want to be a troublemaker, but trouble always seems to follow him. Bobbi Jo gets caught up in all of this, and they eventually are forced to run from the law. Very good action from one of the best racks ever. \t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d877523f71cbe15e3a1ec44b71de9eb9b9c3387","amp;dn":"Bobbie+Jo+And+The+Outlaw+Lynda+Carter+1976+R5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d877523f71cbe15e3a1ec44b71de9eb9b9c3387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,135,117,35,247,28,190,21,227,161,236,68,183,29,233,235,155,156,51,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
