If the government can no longer protect your home, farm or property, HOLDING will teach you how. HOLDING covers virtually every aspect of protecting you and your family in the event society breaks down. Many people have preparations for food, water, shelter and personal defense. HOLDING will teach you how to configure your home, train your team, and properly equip any location for defense. Covering topics ranging from hiding in plain sight to pre-positioning of supplies, HOLDING uses common sense, military tactics and historical examples that allow you to prepare for defense without affecting your property's value or appearance. \n\n\nFormat: Mobi\n\nSeed and Enjoy\n\nif you like the book then please buy a copy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f5f9132ef1b24b84ed39c60f4a9ee49f7364f8","amp;dn":"Holding+your+Ground+-+Joe+Nobody","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f5f9132ef1b24b84ed39c60f4a9ee49f7364f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,245,249,19,46,241,178,75,132,237,57,198,15,74,158,228,159,115,100,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
