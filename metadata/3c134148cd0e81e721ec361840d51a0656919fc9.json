And when she does, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faced with something sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never seen before: a terrifyingly ordinary group of people - kids, grandparents, soccer moms - all recently turned and willing to die to avoid serving a master. And where thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one martyr, there will be more.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBut even vampires have monsters that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re afraid of. And Anita is one of them.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c134148cd0e81e721ec361840d51a0656919fc9","amp;dn":"Laurell+K.+Hamilton+-+Anita+Blake+Book+21+-+Kiss+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c134148cd0e81e721ec361840d51a0656919fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,19,65,72,205,14,129,231,33,236,54,24,64,213,26,6,86,145,159,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
