The film examines Nader\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s advocacy for auto safety features, such as seat belts and air bags, as well as the formation of independent advocacy groups.\n\nThe second half of the film traces Nader\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s shift to a grassroots form of organizing focused on citizen power, including his eventual disillusionment with the two-party system following the rise of Reaganism.\n\nThe film takes its name from the George Bernard Shaw quote, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n\n\nFor information on the movie: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492499/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492499/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBest media players:\nMPC Home Cinema OR VLC - they play everything (make sure to download the codecs to ensure compatibility between your computer and any video file)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691921e025b8be0bbb63c9f1152e4738fee210e9","amp;dn":"An+Unreasonable+Man+%28Ralph+Nader%29+%5B2006%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691921e025b8be0bbb63c9f1152e4738fee210e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,25,33,224,37,184,190,11,187,99,201,241,21,46,71,56,254,226,16,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
