Spaulding and George Simpson.\nÃƒâ€°mile Durkheim, one of the fathers of modern sociology, was the first to suggest that suicide might be as much a response to society as an act of individual despair. When he looked at social, religious, or racial groups that had high incidences of suicide, he discovered that abnormally high or low levels of social integration increase the likelihood of suicide. More than a century after its initial publication, Durkheim's groundbreaking work continues to fascinate and challenge those seeking to understand one of the least understandable of human acts.\nGenre: Non-fiction, sociology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270d586e51ec4fb067a7b07e589abebd0679b72f","amp;dn":"Suicide_+A+Study+in+Sociology+-+Emile+Durkheim.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270d586e51ec4fb067a7b07e589abebd0679b72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,13,88,110,81,236,79,176,103,167,176,126,88,154,190,189,6,121,183,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
