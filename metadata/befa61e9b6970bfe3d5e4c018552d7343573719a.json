The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu ShÃ…ï¿½nen Magazine on September 9, 2009, and has been collected into 15 tankÃ…ï¿½bon volumes as of December 9, 2014. It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by enormous walls as a defense against the Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures who eat humans seemingly without reason. The story initially centers on Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their childhood friend Armin Arlert, who join the military to fight the Titans after their home town is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten. However, as the story progresses and the truths about the Titans are slowly revealed to the reader, the main narrative shifts, centering increasingly more around Historia Reiss, one of the top soldiers from the Survey Corps and the youngest child of the ruling family within the walls, of which the long-kept secrets are directly connected to the origin of the Titans and the lost history of the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:befa61e9b6970bfe3d5e4c018552d7343573719a","amp;dn":"Attack+on+Titan+vol.01-16+%28Shingeki+no+Kyojin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"befa61e9b6970bfe3d5e4c018552d7343573719a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,250,97,233,182,151,11,254,61,94,76,1,133,82,215,52,53,115,113,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
