In his 2003 biography, former member of Manfred Mann's earlier Manfred Mann Band and Beatles-associate Klaus Voormann alleged to have inspired Mann for the Earth Band's name by having besought Mann several times throughout the 1960s that Mann's soft pop style of those days had to become more &quot;earthier&quot; and rockier, not least of all because of the seemingly effeminate image of Mann's earlier band which had led to a number of close encounters with violence particularly in Ireland.\n\nThe original line-up consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar, vocals), Manfred Mann (organ, synthesizer, vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums). In its very earliest stages, the band was simply billed as &quot;Manfred Mann&quot;. This did not mean the band was a solo project, but rather a continuation of the earlier 1960s group Manfred Mann in which Mann was a member. This iteration of the group released their first single &quot;Please Mrs. Henry&quot; in 1971, billed to &quot;Manfred Mann&quot;. Their second single, Randy Newman's &quot;Living Without You&quot; was also released as by Manfred Mann in Europe, but as by Manfred Mann's Earth Band in the USA, where the track became a minor chart hit. Thereafter, &quot;Manfred Mann's Earth Band&quot; was the band name used on all releases.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAngel Station is an album (9th)released in 1979 by Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Angel Station features a six-note descending theme in most of the songs on the album, woven into the context of each song in a different way. &quot;Hollywood Town&quot; and &quot;You Are, I Am&quot; share a common tune and basic arrangement. They occupied almost identical positions on either side of the LP. The album has the air of an emotional and musical crossword puzzle, or has affinities with the work of M. C. Escher, whose art is alluded to on the cover illustration.\n\nOf interest is the involvement of Fingerprintz's Jimmy O'Neill whose influence can be heard in the edgy, angular instrumental &quot;Platform's End&quot; (a song whose title was probably influenced by the fact that it originally closed the 1978 vinyl's A side), and ex-Slapp Happy and Henry Cow member Anthony Moore who produced the album and influenced its modern, sparse sound.\n\n&quot;This is Chris Thompson's last album with the Earth Band as he is forming his own band in the near future. I wish to thank him for a valuable creative and personal relationship, and wish him every success in the future.&quot; - Manfred Mann 1979 In spite of this announcement, Thompson's own outfit Night turned out as unsuccessful, releasing two mostly overlooked albums in 1978 and 1979 respectively, so the singer stayed with the Earth Band instead, returning on the group's next album Chance (1980) already.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:252da8cbdbe13eedc2eec0382030096c716893ad","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann%27s+Earth+Band+-+Angel+Station+%5B1979%5D%5B2011%5D%5B320KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"252da8cbdbe13eedc2eec0382030096c716893ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,45,168,203,219,225,62,237,194,238,192,56,32,48,9,108,113,104,147,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
