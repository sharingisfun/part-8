Throughout the 1980s, McCammon wrote some of the most popular horror novels published, including such best-selling titles as Swan Song, Stinger, and The Wolf's Hour. In the 1990s, his work became more mainstream with such novels as MINE and the World Fantasy Award-winning Boy's Life.\n\nAfter the release of Gone South in 1992, McCammon shied away from publishing. His writing interests started to come into conflict with the big publishers, who insisted on pigeonholing his work. His next novel, Speaks the Nightbird, was more of an historical-fiction/mystery than fantasy/horror book. Potential publishers soured the writer by insisting on substantial changes to support their marketing efforts. McCammon refused to sign a contract and entered into a long phase of semi-retirement.\n\nSpeaks the Nightbird was eventually published in 2002 by River City Publishing, a small Alabama press. The success of the novelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the warm reception by readers eager to see McCammon writing againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½led McCammon to write a sequel entitled The Queen of Bedlam, which was published in 2007. The third novel in the planned ten-book series following the career of &quot;problem solver&quot; Matthew Corbett is Mister Slaughter. It was published by Subterranean Press in January 2010.\n\nMr. McCammon is currently writing the next Matthew Corbett novel, The Providence Rider.\n\nIn between his historical fiction novels, McCammon has planned several contemporary novels, the first of which, The Five, will be published by Subterranean Press in Spring 2011.\n\nRobert McCammon is a lifelong resident of Birmingham, Alabama. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778ab4819c0c67ddd25acf18d3d2baf926f39cd2","amp;dn":"Robert+R.+McCammon+Mobi+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778ab4819c0c67ddd25acf18d3d2baf926f39cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,138,180,129,156,12,103,221,210,90,207,24,211,210,186,249,38,243,156,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
