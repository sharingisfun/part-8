Galbadia, a Global Superpower, has declared war on Dollet, a country whose training academy is home to two personalities: the hot-headed Seifer and the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlone wolfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Squall Leonhart. Both are equally at conflict with each other as their country is with Galbadia; to others, Squall appears lacking in team spirit, while Seifer lacks the discipline of his rival. However, a chance encounter with the free-spirited Rinoa Heartilly turns SquallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s universe upside down; having thrived on discipline, Squall find the carefree Rinoa fascinating.
