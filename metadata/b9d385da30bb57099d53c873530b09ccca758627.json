It is often said that, along with Terri Windling, he established the genre of mythic fiction which falls somewhere between fantasy literature, and mainstream fiction with a magical realist bent. This is debatable, as John Crowley preceded de Lint with the novel &quot;Little, Big&quot;, which was published in 1981, and won the World Fantasy Award the following year for its blending of classical fantasy with modern culture. In any case, de Lint can certainly be credited with popularizing the emerging genre, which is also known as &quot;urban myth&quot; or &quot;urban fantasy.&quot; De Lint&amp;#039;s work has been called &quot;fantasy for people who normally don&amp;#039;t read fantasy.&quot;  (Quoted from Wikipedia)\n\nForests of the Heart (htm)\nJack the Giant-Killer (htm)\nMoonheart (htm)\nSomeplace To Be Flying (htm)\nSomeplace To Be Flying (rtf)\nSpirits in the Wires (htm)\nThe Little Country (htm)\nA Pattern of Silver Strings (html)\nBig City Littles (HTML)\nBooks To Look For [F&amp;SF 2004.12] (HTML)\nCoyote Stories (txt)\nForests of the Heart (pdf)\nGreen Mantel (txt)\nMoonheart (lit)\nMoonheart (txt)\nMulengro (htm)\nPixel Pixies (html)\nSign Here (html)\nSpiritwalk (html)\nThe Little Country (lit)\nThe Moon is Drowning While I Sleep (html)\nThe Riddle of the Wren (html)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d385da30bb57099d53c873530b09ccca758627","amp;dn":"Charles+De+Lint+E-books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d385da30bb57099d53c873530b09ccca758627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,211,133,218,48,187,87,9,157,83,200,115,83,11,9,204,202,117,134,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
