The process is completely automatic and no coded targets, manual editing or special equipments are needed. 3DF Zephyr is built on top of our proprietary, cutting-edge, reconstruction technology. 3DF Zephyr Pro comes with a user friendly interface, and the possibility to export in many common 3D formats or even to generate lossless video without the need of external tools. 3DF Zephyr Pro is the perfect tool for modeling from reality.\n\nApplications\n\n3DF Zephyr Pro has already been successfully employed on a wide range of application such as:\n- UAV and Aerial Mapping for orthophoto generation\n- Architectural modeling\n- Close Range Photogrammetry and Archeology\n- Vehicle Collision Analysis\n- Innovative commerce and marketing solutions\n- 3D Modeling from reality for the game industry\n- Dental 3D reconstruction\n- Health-care prothesis and face reconstruction\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompletely Automatic and fully Customizable - 3DF Zephyr is a simple yet powerful tool. You can Generate a 3D model directly from photos in a completely automatic way with a few clicks. If you like, you can also get full control of of the reconstruction process. Human-friendly parameters let you control every aspect of the processing, for example you can choose speed over accuracy or low poly vs high poly reconstructions.\n\nFirst class technology - 3DF Zephyr is built on the top of 3DF Samanthaand 3DF Stasia: our leading, traceable, academically recognized, in-house built technologies. We are very proud of the technology behind our product as it is a result of many years of research and development. The research behind the product has lead to many academic publications on top-tier Computer Vision Conferences. Our technology is completely transparent and traceable and it is recognized as one of the most effective and innovative. \n\nNo Limits - Every pixel counts in our reconstruction engine. Our technology makes use of every single image pixel to give the most accurate solution as possible. To make this possible, we use an efficient out-of-core mechanism forcomputation. In addition, we do not impose any fixed limit on the number of images you can use for a reconstruction (the number will depends on your memory). \n\nFully autocalibrated - Our reconstruction engine can estimate both the intrinsics and extrinsics camera parameters automatically. Most of the reconstruction pipelines rely only on manual calibration or exif information and fail when this information is not present. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. When the information is not present, we compute everything automatically from the images.\n\nPerform metric Measurements and Control Points Alignment - Align to know Ground Control Points or known distances and perform 3D metric measurements on the reconstructed scene. Control Points can be added anywhere on the scene by using manual 2D matching or by picking already reconstructed 3D points. By fixing a reference system, you can measure anything you want on the scene. \n\nCustomizable Interface - The interface let you customize every aspect of rendering. Adjust any rendering aspects such as lighting, wireframe rendering, colors and sizes. Navigate through the scene with the classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœorbitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ view or with the free camera controls. Rotate-Translate and scale the world as you like from the interface. Use perspective or orthographic camera. Everything can be changed to fit your needs. \n\nTexture generation - Generate fully unwrapped texture. Unwrapped textures make post-processing easier. During the texture generation we proceed in a completely lossless way and we use the images at their original resolution. \n\nImport Camera Extrinsics parameters - If you know the camera position and rotation in advance (obtained for example from other software or from LIDAR stations), you can import them to the interface. In addition it can be used in conjunction with 3DF Lapyx to input manual calibration and you can import results from the command-line version of 3DF Samantha.\n\nExport in many common formats - Export in many common 3D formats (obj, stl, ply, txt, xyz, pts). You can export everything, from the cameraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intrinsics and extrinsics parameters to the dense point clouds and the final meshes. In addition, you can take screenshots and save in png or jpg format or a pdf document \n\nVideo Rendering - Perform key-frame animations and record videos directly from the software. 3DF Zephyr encodes video in the most common formats using ffmpeg. You do not need an external frame grabber and video are rendered inside the software in a completely lossless way. From the interface you can add keyframes from any position, set the desired times and perform smooth animations. \n\nCuda Enabled - Our reconstruction engine wisely use all the resources available. Many part of the computation are carried out on the GPU, where the Nvidia Cuda Technology is available. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you have a Cuda enabled GPU? DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, the algorithms will still run on the cpu (at lower speed) without any loss of accuracy. \n\nAdjustable volume of reconstruction - Adjust the volume of reconstruction to the specific area of interest.\n\nOrtophoto, Orthomosaic and DEM generation - Generate geo-referenced Ortophotos, Orthomosaics or DEMs within a few clicks. A user friendly wizard will guide you to the process in which you can preview the results in real-time before saving. The generation process uses all the pixels information to preserve as much detail as possible.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum System Requirement:\n- OS: Windows 8.1/8/7/Vista (32 or 64 bit)\n- Processor: Dual Core 2.0GHz or equivalent processor\n- Memory: 2GB System RAM\n- Hard Disk Space: 4GB free HDD Space\n- Video Card: Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 256 MB of RAM\n\nRecommended System Requirement\n- OS: Windows 8.1/8/7/Vista (32 or 64 bit)\n- Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD CPU\n- Memory: 8GB System RAM\n- Hard Disk: 10GB free HDD Space Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SSD drive\n- Video Card: DirectX 9.0c NVIDIA video card with 1GB of RAM (Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or higher; Nvidia CUDA 2000 or higher)\n\nLanguages : English, Italiano\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-pro-3d-models-from-photos/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-pro-3d-models-from-photos/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ff8e21bb203670e2bb2aea55c9eb2db030f4ac2","amp;dn":"3DFlow+3DF+Zephyr+Pro+1.009+Win+%28crack+iND%29+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ff8e21bb203670e2bb2aea55c9eb2db030f4ac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,248,226,27,178,3,103,14,43,178,174,165,92,158,178,219,3,15,74,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
