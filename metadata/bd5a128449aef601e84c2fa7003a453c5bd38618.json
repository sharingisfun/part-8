The album was recorded between Winter and Spring 2013 at Rock Studio in Austria and will be self-released by the band 3 years after their previous work Ã¢â‚¬Å“Armored BardsÃ¢â‚¬Å“. Each song of the album is about something that gives you power, might, or just a good feeling. It is about the different aspects of your personal inner force. There are various topics, but the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inner ForceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sums them up. Heathen Foray revealed the album tracklist and the cover artwork, illustrated by Fabrizio De Rossi. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Inner ForceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is available for pre-order via their Bandcamp page.\n\nThe musical style of Heathen Foray is hard to define. Some people say they play Viking-Metal with strong Power-Metal influence. Others say that they play Melodic-Death-Metal with Folk influences.

The album Ã¢â‚¬Å¾The PassageÃ¢â‚¬Å“ leads to a record deal with the german label Black Bards Entertainment.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å¾The PassageÃ¢â‚¬Å“ (rel. 2009) is welcomed with open arms by critics.
