Jagger fronted the Rolling Stones for over 20 years before he began a solo career in 1985. At the time of the release of his debut solo album, She's the Boss, it appeared that the Stones may have been approaching the end of their career, but it soon transpired that Jagger's solo career would run concurrently with that of the band's. Over the next decade, he released a string of solo albums, none of which achieved the commercial success of the Stones' less popular releases. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifixqe5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:hifixqe5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nJagger doesn't show any signs of wear on his third -- and by far best -- solo album. If anything, his voice seems to have developed a deeper bottom end without sacrificing any of the highs. This is not always an advantage -- the forced falsetto and rhythmic pulse of &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; causes a nightmarish flashback to the Stones' disco flirtations in the mid-'70s. But more times than not, this disc works. A lot of the credit goes to Jagger's backing band and producer Rick Rubin who keep things lean, mean, and simple. The economy of performance allows Jagger to remain credible on a wide variety of styles -- he delivers a groovin', sultry version of Bill Withers' soul classic &quot;Use Me,&quot; a passionate country ballad on &quot;Evening Gown,&quot; and even pulls off an Irish traditional folk piece with &quot;Handsome Molly.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gvftxq95ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gvftxq95ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Wandering-Spirit-Mick-Jagger/dp/B000002IUO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Wandering-Spirit-Mick-Jagger/dp/B000002IUO&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
