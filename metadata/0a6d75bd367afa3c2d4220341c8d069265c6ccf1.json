The text has been thoroughly revised and updated, with each chapter authored by a recognized expert in the field.  Three chapters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ground Segment, Product Assurance and Spacecraft System Engineering ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have been rewritten, and the topic of Assembly, Integration and Verification has been introduced as a new chapter, filling a gap in previous editions.\n\nThis edition addresses ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“front-end system-level issuesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ such as environment, mission analysis and system engineering, but also progresses to a detailed examination of subsystem elements which represents the core of spacecraft design. This includes mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects, as well as propulsion and control. This quantitative treatment is supplemented by an emphasis on the interactions between elements, which deeply influences the process of spacecraft design.\n\nAdopted on courses worldwide, Spacecraft Systems Engineering is already widely respected by students, researchers and practising engineers in the space engineering sector. It provides a valuable resource for practitioners in a wide spectrum of disciplines, including system and subsystem engineers, spacecraft equipment designers, spacecraft operators, space scientists and those involved in related sectors such as space insurance.\n\nIn summary, this is an outstanding resource for aerospace engineering students, and all those involved in the technical aspects of design and engineering in the space sector.\n\n\nISBN: 978-0-470-75012-4\nHardcover\n724 pages\nSeptember 2011","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a6d75bd367afa3c2d4220341c8d069265c6ccf1","amp;dn":"Spacecraft+Systems+Engineering%2C4rd+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a6d75bd367afa3c2d4220341c8d069265c6ccf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,109,117,189,54,122,250,60,45,66,32,52,28,141,6,146,101,198,204,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
