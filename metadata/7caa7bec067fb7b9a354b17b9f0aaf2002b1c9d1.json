Weeks\n\n2002, second edition, illustrated, 405 pages, pdf file\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nMaintaining the standard of excellence set by the previous edition,\nthis textbook covers the basic geometry of two- and three-dimensional\nspaces Written by a master expositor, leading researcher in the field,\nand MacArthur Fellow, it includes experiments to determine the true\nshape of the universe and contains illustrated examples and engaging\nexercises that teach mind-expanding ideas in an intuitive and informal\nway. Bridging the gap from geometry to the latest work in observational\ncosmology, the book illustrates the connection between geometry and the\nbehavior of the physical universe and explains how radiation remaining\nfrom the big bang may reveal the actual shape of the universe.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nPart I   Surfaces and Three-Manifolds\nPart II  Geometries on Surfaces\nPart III Geometries on Three-Manifolds\nPart IV  The Universe\n\n**********************************************************************\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Weeks_(mathematician)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Weeks_(mathematician)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7caa7bec067fb7b9a354b17b9f0aaf2002b1c9d1","amp;dn":"The+Shape+of+Space+%5B2002+-+Jeffrey+R.+Weeks%5D+physical+cosmology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7caa7bec067fb7b9a354b17b9f0aaf2002b1c9d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,170,123,236,6,127,183,185,163,84,177,123,159,10,175,32,2,177,201,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
