The band has gone through several phases, but its strongest commercial success came in the late 1970s until its initial disbandment in 1987. During this period, they had hits with a series of power ballads and rock songs including 1981's &quot;Don't Stop Believin'&quot;, which would later become the top-selling catalog track in iTunes history, at more than four million downloads,[1][2][3] and their highest-charting US hit, 1982's &quot;Open Arms&quot;, which would later become an international hit for Mariah Carey. The group enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid 1990s with a Grammy-nominated hit, &quot;When You Love a Woman&quot;. Sales have resulted in two gold albums, eight multi-platinum albums, and one Diamond album (including seven consecutive multi-platinum albums between 1978 and 1987). They had 19 Top 40 singles, six of which reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Allmusic has described Journey as &quot;one of America's most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands.&quot;[4]\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America, Journey has sold 47 million albums in the United States, making them the 28th best selling band. Their worldwide sales have reached over 75 million albums.[5][6] A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history.[7][8]\n\nJourney has been eligible for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame since 2000, but Gregg Rolie is the only current or former member of Journey who has been inducted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a member of parent band Santana. Steve Perry, the band's best-known lead vocalist, has been eligible for induction as a solo artist since 2009. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Essential 2001\n\n\nThe Essential Journey is a compilation of songs from the rock band Journey.
