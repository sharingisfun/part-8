Works have here been integrated to provide an overview of the field. Indian painting is so diverse that the paintings of the Mughal, Deccani, Rajput and Pahari courts are usually treated individually. This work explores the connections between the different traditions caused by changes in patronage, the movement of artists from one area to another and the diffusion of styles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4c44e0d0748a3be61d3083ef46110eb7bee0482","amp;dn":"Indian+Court+Painting%2C+XVI-XIX+Century+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4c44e0d0748a3be61d3083ef46110eb7bee0482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,196,78,13,7,72,163,190,97,211,8,62,244,97,16,235,123,238,4,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
