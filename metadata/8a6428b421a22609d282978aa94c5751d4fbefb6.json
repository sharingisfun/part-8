Kendrick Lamar]\n\nLyrics:\n\n[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]\nWe do not exist in\nAny other instant\nHere in this dimension\nYou and I are meant to be\nI have waited lifetimes to find you\nNow that you're here\nI can remind you\nOf the things you've been dreaming\nTimes two\nI promise you\nIf you just give me 24\nMan, all I need is 24 hours\nI promise you'll want plenty more\nYou've probably been waiting forever\nSo how does it sound:\nUs on the ground\nGiving you my love?\n\n[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]\nThere's no place quite like here\nThere's no better time than now\nYou gotta stay ready\nThere's no place quite like here\nThere's no better time than now\nThat's why I stay ready\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nTell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip\nAnd when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip\nRide on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'\nI can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip\nI'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate\nBut if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy\nAnd yea, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me\nI'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy\nWe gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around\nAnd triple through triplets of babies right now\nAnd that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile\nThat means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection\nI find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored\nWe find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored\nI know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up\nThen I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche\n\n[Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]\nCome to me, come, come to me\nLook at what you've done to me\nYou put a gun to me\nThen you brought the sun to me\n\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]\nShine like blood diamonds\nLearning to have patience only cause you are timeless\nThe universe energy doesn't lie\nAnd this chemistry is infinity at a million times\nI wrote a million rhymes describing your star power\nAnd after 24 bars, you get 24 hours\n\n[Hook 1]\n\n[Bridge (x2): Jhene Aiko]\nAll that I know is right now\nNothing's for sure but, right now\nGotta get yours like, right now\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a6428b421a22609d282978aa94c5751d4fbefb6","amp;dn":"Jhene+Aiko+-+Stay+Ready+%28What+a+Life%29+%5Bfeat.+Kendrick+Lamar%5D+%5BSa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a6428b421a22609d282978aa94c5751d4fbefb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,100,40,180,33,162,38,9,210,130,151,138,169,76,87,81,212,251,239,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
