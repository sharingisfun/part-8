The lead rock single was also announced, &quot;Revolution&quot;, which was scheduled to be released sometime in August 2014. The track was described as a 'departure' for Nickelback and a political song. It was also announced that frequent collaborator Chris Lord-Alge will return to mix some of the tracks on the album. It was also announced the band had signed to Republic Records. Chad also hinted that a potential album title was No Fixed Address.\n\n\nOn August 22, 2014, Nickelback announced via Twitter that the album will be titled No Fixed Address and they released the track listing along with it.\n\n\nThe album title, No Fixed Address, was inspired by the fact that the album was recorded in many different places, and they never settled in a single spot.\n\n\nLead singer Chad Kroeger said the album has some songs that are a significant departure from the band's typical musical style, including a song called &quot;Got Me Runnin' Round&quot; that features Flo Rida and has a horn section in it.\n\n\n\n\nLine-up:\nChad Kroeger - lead vocals, lead guitar\nRyan Peake - rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals\nMike Kroeger - bass, backing vocals\nDaniel Adair - drums, backing vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography:\nCurb 1996\nThe State      2000\nSilver Side Up       2001\nThree-Sided Coin      2003\nThe Long Road      2003\nAll the Right Reasons      2005\nDark Horse      2008\nHere and Now      2011\nThe Best of Nickelback Volume 1      2013\nNo Fixed Address   2014\n\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
