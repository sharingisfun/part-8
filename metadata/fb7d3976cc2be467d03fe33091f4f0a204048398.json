In other words, it creates one focused image from the set of several partially focused photographs by combining the focused areas.\n\nThe program is designed for macrophotography, microphotography and hyperfocal landscape photography to cope with the shallow depth-of-field problem. Helicon Focus also aligns images as objects often change their size and position from shot to shot. This function is especially important for macrophotography.\n\nFeatures:\n\n64 bit mode - get advantages of all available physical memory, significantly improves performance on machines with more than 2Gb of RAM.\nRetouching brush to clone from aligned source images to the resulting image (cannot be performed with external photo editor).\n2D micropanorama.\nAutomatically adjusts and resizes images (important for stereomicroscopes and macrophotography).\nHas no limitation on image resolutions (512MB+ RAM required to work with 8Mp+ images).\nProcess unlimited number of images in a stack.\nPreserves details by using advanced interpolators for image manipulation (Lanczos, Sinc256).\nInternal workflow always uses 16 bit color depth to preserve colors.\nClean dust artifacts, by removing black points from the resulting images.\nAutomatically adjust brightness of adjacent images.\nReads RAW, 8bit and 16bit TIFFs, JPEG, JPEG 2000, BMP, etc.\nWrites 8bit and 16bit TIFFs, JPEG, JPEG 2000, BMP, PSD, PNG.\nExport of 3D model of the object to Helicon 3D Viewer (included into Helicon Focus v4.2+ installation)\nExport of animated stacks (v4.2+) \n\nWhat's New\nVersion 4.2.9:\n\nAdded plug-in installation for exporting images from Lightroom.\nAdded new render method &quot;C&quot;.\nUpdated Helicon Focus engine.\nImproved performance for application processes.\nFixed some UI bugs.\nHelicon Focus 4.2.9 is the last update which supports Mac OS X 10.5 systems.\nDevelopment of new features for this product line is discontinued and subsequent updates will include only bug fixes. The future updates of Helicon Focus will support only Mac OS X 10.6 systems or later. \n\nRequirements\nPPC / Intel, Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7d3976cc2be467d03fe33091f4f0a204048398","amp;dn":"Helicon+Focus+4.2.9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7d3976cc2be467d03fe33091f4f0a204048398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,125,57,118,204,43,228,103,208,63,227,48,145,244,240,162,4,4,131,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
