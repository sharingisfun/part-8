This is the first national series to exÃ‚Â¬plore the impact of the new American mainstream--the growing numbers of Asians, Latinos, African Americans, persons of mixed race, immigrants, women, youth, and LGBTs whose influence over culture, commerce, and the outcome of elections is afÃ‚Â¬fecting every aspect of contemporary life. Each half-hour program focuses on under-reported stories from every corner of the nation, amplified by the numbers--original statistical analysis and infographics illustrating the latest trends in population, health, education, and quality of life in America. From Native Americans confronting an oil boom in North Dakota to underserved vetÃ‚Â¬erans in Guam; from Asian students struggling to complete high school in California to multicultural Mad Men in Texas; America By The Numbers showcases compelling stories, surprising data, distinctive visuals, and the immersive first-person reporting style of award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa.\n\n\n1)  Mainstream USA \nWelcome to Clarkston, Georgia-one of America's most diverse square miles. Designated as a refugee resettlement site in the 1980s, Clarkston is home to people from over 40 different countries. Once a hub for the Ku Klux Klan, the city has gone from being 90% white to 82% non-white in just 30 years.\nWe examine how Clarkston's daily realities reflect wider demographic trends, and explore the collaborations and collisions that are occurring between the old and new South.\n\n2)  Island of Warriors \nPacific Islanders serve in the U.S. military in disproportionally high numbers, and have suffered the highest casualty rates in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nWe visit Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, to speak to some of the island's veterans. The men and women here are American citizens and serve in our country's military at a rate three times higher than the rest of the country. We explore why Guam's returning veterans say they can't get the healthcare they need.\n\n3)  Our Private Idaho \nAmerican suburbs are becoming more diverse, but the &quot;exurbs&quot; that surround them remain overwhelmingly white. In fact, while whites account for only 8% of total U.S. population growth, they make up 73% of growth in exurban areas.\nWe visit Coeur d'Alene, Idaho-a town that successfully ousted the Aryan Nations in 2000, but remains over 94% white. We explore both the allure and the complexity of living in a homogenous community.\n\n4)  Native American Boomtown \nThe Bakken Oil Boom is bringing billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs to North Dakota. But most people don't know that a substantial part of the state's oil production is concentrated on an Indian reservation. Fort Berthold Reservation's 1,000-plus oil wells have brought in money and jobs for some.\nBut the oil has also brought danger-organized crime, hard drugs, traffic fatalities-and other problems. We speak to tribal members about the benefits-and consequences-of the boom.\n\n5)  Politics of the New South \nWe return to Clarkston, Georgia to follow unlikely candidates in the city's 2013 local election, as three Mayoral and City Council candidates are former refugees who will be running for office-and voting-for the first time.\nThese new American candidates were inspired to run for office after screening and participating in Episode 1: Mainstream, USA . Will they be able to bring new voters to the polls and make their voices heard? AMERICA BY THE NUMBERS documents this remarkable moment in Clarkston's history.\n\n6)  Pass or Fail in Cambodia Town \nAsian Americans are the best-educated and highest-income ethnic group in the United States. They are often referred to as the &quot;model minority,&quot; suggesting that all Asians are successful in school and in life. But Southeast Asian Americans have some of the lowest high school completion rates in the nation.\nWe visit Long Beach, California-the city with America's largest Cambodian community-to find out why this educational crisis is happening and what people are doing about it.\n\n7)  Surviving Year One \nThe U.S. spends more on healthcare than any other nation, and the biggest portion goes towards pregnancy and childbirth. Despite that, the nation ranks 56th lowest in the world for infant mortality.\nTo find out more about this critical issue, we visit Rochester, New York-where babies are dying at a rate two times higher than the national average, and where mothers of color are three times more likely than white mothers to lose their babies before their first birthday. As we search for answers, we also visit the programs that are working to reverse these dramatic disparities.\n\n8)  The New Mad Men \nWith a collective purchasing power of $3 trillion, people of color are quickly becoming the nation's most sought-after consumers. Iconic brands are re-examining their marketing strategies in order to stay competitive in the changing marketplace. Latinos, with a buying power of $1.2 trillion, are at the heart of this new consumer focus.\nWe take an exclusive look inside LatinWorks, one of the most successful multicultural ad agencies in the country, and learn how they are speaking to the multicultural millennial market.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/7bc9481f05c20ef1a497c1675f1c5b1f60718c26.jpg&quot;
