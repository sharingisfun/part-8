Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) has it all -\nlooks, intelligence, wealth and opportunity - and a wicked cruel streak.\nProne to mocking and humiliating aggressively unattractive classmates, he\nzeroes in on Goth classmate Kendra (Mary-Kate Olsen), inviting her to the\nschool's extravagant environmental bash. Kendra accepts, and, true to form,\nKyle blows her off in a particularly savage fashion. She retaliates by casting\na spell that physically transforms him into everything he despises. Enraged\nby his horrible and unrecognizable appearance he confronts Kendra and learns\nthat the only solution to the curse is to find someone that will love him as\nhe is - a task he considers impossible. Repulsed by his appearance, Kyle's\ncallous father (Peter Krause) banishes him to Brooklyn with a sympathetic\nhousekeeper (LisaGay Hamilton) and blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris). As Kyle\nponders how to overcome the curse and get his old life back, he chances upon\na drug addict in the act of killing a threatening dealer. Seizing the\nopportunity, Kyle promises the addict freedom and safety for his daughter\nLindy (Vanessa Hudgens) if she will consent to live in Kyle's Brooklyn home.\nThus begins Kyle's journey to discover true love in this hyper-modern\nretelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast story. In addition to his role\nas director, Barnz wrote the screenplay, which is based on the Alex Flinn\nnovel of the same name.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Mary-Kate Olsen.\n=&gt;-Vanessa Hudgens.\n=&gt;-Alex Pettyfer.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Daniel Barnz.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Fantasy : Romance.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2011.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.12 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 867 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 26mn.\n=&gt;-Beastly....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beastly/\n=&gt;-Beastly....................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/beastly/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 144 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a971886423f774deb01508f9a4ce7755e15818eb","amp;dn":"Beastly+-+Drama+Fantasy+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a971886423f774deb01508f9a4ce7755e15818eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,113,136,100,35,247,116,222,176,21,8,249,164,206,119,85,225,88,24,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
