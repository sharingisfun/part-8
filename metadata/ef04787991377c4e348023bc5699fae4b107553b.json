As in his masterpiece, Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein uses explosive montage to create the spirit of revolution--in this case, the events in St. Petersburg during the months leading up to the Bolshevik revolt. Eisenstein's insistence on speaking the language of pure film (deploying space, shadow, movement, and rhythm to create his meaning) shoves his mad rush of images straight into the viewer's eye. A worker's rebellion in the streets, followed by the raising of bridges to isolate their neighborhood, becomes a visual symphony of panic. The film has also been known as Ten Days That Shook the World, its release title in the U.S. (borrowed from the book by John Reed). Its value as propaganda can be debated, but October is incredibly dynamic as film art. --Robert Horton\n\nRussian director Sergei Eisenstein's powerful retelling of the 1917 Russian Revolution, &quot;October&quot; is an acknowledged masterpiece in the use of editing, lighting, camera placement and mise-en-scene. An absolute must for any film connoisseurs collection.\n\n\nThis is a wonderful silent movie with a music soundtrack and some English text hardsubbed (instead of the Russian parts). Enjoy :)\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE'\n\nSimply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef04787991377c4e348023bc5699fae4b107553b","amp;dn":"Oktyabr+%28Sergei+M.+Eisenstein%2C+1927%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef04787991377c4e348023bc5699fae4b107553b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,4,120,121,145,55,124,78,52,128,35,188,86,153,250,228,177,7,85,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
