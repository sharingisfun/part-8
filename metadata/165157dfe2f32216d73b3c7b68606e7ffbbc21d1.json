His approach, which is to ask a lot of seemingly innocent questions, has much the same effect as the good storytelling he is trying to teach us.it draws us in and makes us think. I can't imagine anyone, in or out of our business, who won't find any number of helpful ideas as they work their way through the filmmaking jungles!!\n- Roy Disney, Director Emeritus and consultant for The Walt Disney Company\n\nFrancis Glebas was one of our most talented storyboard artists at Disney, and it was our great fortune to have him on the story team. He has a wealth of experience to share.\n- Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO, Dreamworks Animation\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:165157dfe2f32216d73b3c7b68606e7ffbbc21d1","amp;dn":"Directing+The+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"165157dfe2f32216d73b3c7b68606e7ffbbc21d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,81,87,223,226,243,34,22,215,59,60,123,104,96,110,127,251,188,33,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
