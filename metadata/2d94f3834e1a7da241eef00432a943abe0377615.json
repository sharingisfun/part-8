Hinayana flourished in Ceylon, Burma, Siam and Cambodia; Mystic Buddhism developed in Tibet; Mahayana grew in China. In Japan the whole of Buddhism became the living and active faith of the mass of the people. The present study relates to Japanese Buddhism, as in Japan alone the whole of Buddhism has been preserved. The author presents Buddhist Philosophy in an ideological sequence, but it is not the sequence in the development of ideas; it is rather the systematization of the different schools of thought for the purpose of easier approach. Divided into fifteen chapters, the book deals with different schools of Buddhist Philosophy. The author has grouped these schools under two heads: (1) the schools of Negative Rationalism, i.e. the Religion of Dialectic Investigation, and (2) the schools of Introspective Intuitionism, i.e. the Religion of Meditative Experience. The author treats these schools in most scientific and elaborate way.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author:\nJunjiro Takakusu (1866-1945)was appointed Professor in Tokyo University and Director of Tokyo School of Foreign Languages simultaneously. In 1930, he became the President of Tokyo University.\n\nThis torrent contains a fully indexed, browse-able and searchable copy of the book in PDF form, taken from a scan of the 2nd edition and manually created.
