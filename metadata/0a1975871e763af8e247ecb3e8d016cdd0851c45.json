In the right place at the right time, he was sought out by a number of foreign companies who wanted help in navigating the new economy. The adventures came fast, as did the business and cultural lessons.\n\nPoorly Made in China is a dramatic romp through China's export manufacturing sector, one that reveals what really goes on behind the scenes. The story follows the author from one project to the next, taking the reader through a diverse set of industries and revealing a number of challenges.\n\nAn engaging business narrative told with doses of humor and insight, this true story pulls back the curtain on the rising Chinese economy, providing a closer look at the rough-and-tumble environment in which so many of our consumer products are being made. For those trying to make sense of why so many quality failures could come out of China at once, this book is an especially interesting read.\n\nPoorly Made in China is the tale of a modern-day gold rush and its consequences, the chronicling of a rising economic power and its path along a steep growth curve. Entertaining and eye-opening, the book highlights the extent to which culture affects business dealings, and the ultimate suggestion is that we may have more to be concerned about than product failures alone.&quot; \n\n256 pages \nPublisher: Wiley (Mar 18 2009) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1975871e763af8e247ecb3e8d016cdd0851c45","amp;dn":"Poorly+Made+In+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1975871e763af8e247ecb3e8d016cdd0851c45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,25,117,135,30,118,58,248,226,71,236,179,232,208,22,205,208,133,28,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
