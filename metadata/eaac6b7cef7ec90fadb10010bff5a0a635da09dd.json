Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 sadly isn&amp;#039;t the disc\n          it ideally could be, but it nonetheless summarizes how steady Korn were over the     \n          years, developing their sound oh so slightly from one album to the next and, in the  \n          process, coming up with several unquestionably killer songs every go-round. The      \n          band&amp;#039;s six full-lengths resulted in enough of those killer songs to fill this best-of\n          to the brim; in fact, there are quite a few more that could have been compiled here  \n          as well if there were more space on this single-disc release (a double disc would    \n          have been definitive). As it stands, however, practically every song here is a       \n          highlight in and of itself, with the sole exceptions of the below-par ballad-like    \n          &quot;Alone I Break&quot; and a space-wasting pair of album-opening covers: Cameo&amp;#039;s &quot;Word Up!&quot; \n          and Pink Floyd&amp;#039;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Pts. 1-3.&quot; These covers are here        \n          undoubtedly to bait the legions of Korn fans who already own all the band&amp;#039;s albums   \n          but are loyal enough to purchase this best-of just for this pair of new recordings.  \n          And yes, they&amp;#039;re quite curious, so much so that you&amp;#039;ll want to give them a listen if \n          you&amp;#039;re a fan (download them, though -- they&amp;#039;re curious, no doubt, but certainly not  \n          worth the price of this disc alone). The band&amp;#039;s &quot;Word Up!&quot; cover is awesome, and the \n          Pink Floyd cover is well-crafted and grandiose. Then again, these two songs are so   \n          well known that you have to wonder, what&amp;#039;s the point? Like Korn&amp;#039;s previous cover of  \n          Metallica&amp;#039;s &quot;One,&quot; though, the point seems to be one of curiousity rather than       \n          one-upmanship. In any event, these covers aren&amp;#039;t the best way to start off this      \n          best-of -- not at all -- nor is the reverse chronological sequencing ideal. Because  \n          Korn developed their sound over the years, even if only slightly, it&amp;#039;d have been     \n          better to map out that progressive trajectory here, rather than hear the band regress\n          from the elaborate, theatrical bombast of their later albums to the stripped-down    \n          naked rawness of their fierce debut. These quibbles aside, it&amp;#039;s worthy stating again \n          that there&amp;#039;s nothing but great songs here. If you&amp;#039;re new to Korn, the most           \n          influential and successful metal band of the mid- to late &amp;#039;90s, this disc should blow\n          you away -- that is, assuming you&amp;#039;re a fan of extreme music with a dark, disturbing  \n          edge. But if indeed you&amp;#039;re new to Korn, you&amp;#039;d be better off skipping over this       \n          best-of and heading straight for their self-titled debut (their one undisputed       \n          classic), and then moving chronologically forward through the band&amp;#039;s catalog. Each   \n          album stands well on its own, albeit some better than others, and here you&amp;#039;re only   \n          getting the tip of each iceberg. But if money is a concern and you can only afford   \n          one Korn disc for your collection, don&amp;#039;t think twice about picking up Greatest Hits. \n          You won&amp;#039;t be disappointed. No chance of that. Plus, there&amp;#039;s a bonus DVD here of      \n          Korn&amp;#039;s 2003 show at CBGB that will give you a good taste of what the band is like    \n          live.                                                                                \n                                                                                               \n          Ed&amp;#039;s Note- We ripped the DVD too; kickass XviD..
