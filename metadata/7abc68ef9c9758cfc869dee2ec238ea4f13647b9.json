Why are we here? Do we really matter?\n\n\nIn a world fraught with hostility and violence, an altruistic group of young men endeavor to understand the true essence of the human spirit by visiting forgotten souls such as homeless New Yorkers, Peruvian orphans and isolated Ghanaian lepers. By spotlighting heartwarming stories from around the world, this uplifting documentary shows viewers that every single person, no matter his or her lot in life, is beautiful. Gorgeously filmed and masterfully narrated, THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE explores with depth and compassion what it means to be a human being.\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten by: Michael Campo\n=========================\n\nDirected by: Charles Kinnane \n============================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The Human Experience\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:29:28\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1831 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    1.14 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252298/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252298/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7abc68ef9c9758cfc869dee2ec238ea4f13647b9","amp;dn":"The+Human+Experience-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7abc68ef9c9758cfc869dee2ec238ea4f13647b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,188,104,239,156,151,88,207,200,105,222,226,236,35,142,164,241,54,71,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
