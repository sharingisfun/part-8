He drives a cattle herd from Wyoming to Seattle, by ship to Skagway, and (after a delay caused by larcenous town boss Gannon) through the mountains to Dawson. There, he and his partner Ben Tatum get into the gold business themselves. Two lovely women fall for misanthropic Jeff, but he believes in every-man-for-himself, turning his back on growing lawlessness...until it finally strikes home.\n\nRip Specs (HD-TV Rip)\n\nGeneral           : 1954-The.Far.Country.HDTV.x264.720p.Ac3-DMMD&amp;loga.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 6 608 Kbps\nLength            : 4.48 GiB for 1h 36mn 59s 132ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 5 901 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 718 (1.783) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nAudio #1          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nAudio #2          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048055/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048055/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English or Spanish\nSubtitles: Spanish, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7cb09078bab0a9e8f3de1b6e0f58ef90d39554","amp;dn":"1954-The.Far.Country.HDTV.x264.720p.Ac3-DMMD%26amp%3Bloga.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7cb09078bab0a9e8f3de1b6e0f58ef90d39554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,124,176,144,120,186,176,169,232,243,222,27,110,15,88,239,144,211,149,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
