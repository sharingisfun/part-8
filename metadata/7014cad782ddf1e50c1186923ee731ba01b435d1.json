Cat Stevens &quot;Tea for the tillerman&quot; was a CD I admired\nbut couldn't afford at the local department store as I liked a couple\nof his songs such as &quot;wild world&quot; &quot;morning has broken&quot; &quot;peace train&quot;\n&quot;moonshadow&quot; &quot;on very young one&quot; and &quot;hard headed woman&quot;. I haven't\nlistened to these songs for decades, however while growing up I\ncertainly did find them fun although I mainly was a fan of Tom Jones\nand Englebert along with the Bay City Rollers Donny Osmond and the\nlike. I had a nice expensive hi-fi stereo I bought from working part\ntime, my parent had a lovely house in which we lived and I bought many\nrecords on the record of the month club plan back then.\n\nenjoy Cat Stevens for those that like this music\nthat hasn't lost its appeal one bit, I'm sure\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\nCat Stevens - Father And Son (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Hard Headed Woman (remastered)\nCat Stevens - How Can I Tell You (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Moonshadow (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Morning Has Broken (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Oh Very Young (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Peace Train (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Sitting (remastered)\nCat Stevens - The First Cut Is The Deepest (remastered)\nCat Stevens - The Wind (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Where Do The Children Play (remastered)\nCat Stevens - Wild World (remastered)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7014cad782ddf1e50c1186923ee731ba01b435d1","amp;dn":"The+best+of+Cat+Stevens+%28remastered%29+20th+ME+%28musicfromrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7014cad782ddf1e50c1186923ee731ba01b435d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,20,202,215,130,221,241,229,12,17,134,146,62,231,49,186,1,180,53,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
