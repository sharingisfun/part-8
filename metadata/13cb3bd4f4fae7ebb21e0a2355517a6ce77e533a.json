Surprisingly, he is not identified with radical formal or harmonic innovations, or with the profound kind of symbolism heard in some of Bach's works. Mozart's best music has a natural flow and irresistible charm, and can express humor, joy or sorrow with both conviction and mastery. His operas, especially his later efforts, are brilliant examples of high art, as are many of his piano concertos and later symphonies. Even his lesser compositions and juvenile works feature much attractive and often masterful music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13cb3bd4f4fae7ebb21e0a2355517a6ce77e533a","amp;dn":"Mozart+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13cb3bd4f4fae7ebb21e0a2355517a6ce77e533a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,203,59,212,244,250,231,235,178,30,10,35,85,81,122,108,231,126,83,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
