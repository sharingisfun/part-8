The Church was designed by the Maltese military architect Glormu Cassar (Girolamo Cassar) who designed several of the more prominent buildings in Valletta. The church is considered to be one of the finest examples of high Baroque architecture in Europe and one of the world's great cathedrals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fbc23edc30ebb83c15bc343958064661e3af008","amp;dn":"Malta+-+History+and+Works+of+Art+of+St+Johns+Church+%28Art+Ebook%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fbc23edc30ebb83c15bc343958064661e3af008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,188,35,237,195,14,187,131,193,91,195,67,149,128,100,102,30,58,240,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
