But there's no mistaking the irresistibly masculine Scottish Highlander whose chamber she's accidentally infiltrated--or the severe wound he's suffered in battle. As a doctor, Ali knows how to heal his injury, how to nurse his body back to health. What she doesn't know is how to heal his heart. . .\n\nA proud warrior and the leader of a powerful clan, Rory MacLeod is ready to fight to the death to protect his homeland. After all, ever since tragedy robbed him of his wife, he has had nothing to lose. Yet the mysterious woman sent to tend his wounds is beginning to reawaken something inside him--something that he'd rather stay buried. But when true passion is mixed with Scottish magic, even the most fearsome warrior could begin to fall. . .\n\n\n\nBook 2 - WARRIOR OF THE ISLES\n\nIn a time of raids and ransoms, Aiden MacLeod is responsible for a formidable Scottish keep and all the people within. Yet the fearless Highland laird never forgets his charge to shield his young half-brother from the grave consequences of his tragic birth.\nBut an alluring stranger known only as Syrena could undo all of Aiden's defenses. For Syrena has vowed to bring Aiden's brother to a realm far from the Scotland of their understanding. To succeed, she is at Aiden's mercy. Ignoring his attraction to the beautiful Syrena is pointless. But if Aiden lets himself trust the enchanting woman who has so quickly captured his heart, he'll be forced to risk everything he has sworn to protect..\n\n\nBook 3 - KING OF THE ISLES\n\nEvangeline may be powerfully persuasive in her way, but convincing the notoriously wild Highland king Lachlan MacLeod to strengthen his alliances with a strategic marriage seems to be asking the impossible. Stubborn and proud, Lachlan seems determined to go against her will, even if it means endangering the people he's sworn to protect and the enchanted isle that has already seen so much discord.\nYet the battle-scarred Highlander cannot ignore his sultry advisor for long. When his mentor is kidnapped, forcing him to ride into combat alongside the beautiful Evangeline, he must choose between her safety and his own independence. It's a choice he makes in an instant ...but once wed to the woman he could not resist, he'll soon find that his heart is in even greater danger than his kingdom...\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThe mobi file is an original conversion. The KindleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Contents tab does not cover all chapters in the three books. The books own internal chapter links all seem to work though.\nUsing bookmarking for the internal Contents pages for each of the books might be useful for some people, though Kindle tends to open where one left off reading.\n\nFor the epub I have amended the Table of Contents, and these are fully functioning using the application Aldiko. Tested these files out on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model).\n\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c382b437b7f0651337757c8d52814c48c13de0b1","amp;dn":"Men+of+the+Isles+ebooks+by+Debbie+Mazzuca+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c382b437b7f0651337757c8d52814c48c13de0b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,130,180,55,183,240,101,19,55,117,124,141,82,129,76,72,193,61,224,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
