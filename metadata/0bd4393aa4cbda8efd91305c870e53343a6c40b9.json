While in the disco, Tony is the king, and the visits help him to temporarily forget the reality of his life: a dead-end job, clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents, racial tensions in the local community, and his associations with a gang of dead-beat friends.\n\nA huge commercial success, the movie significantly helped to popularize disco music around the world and made Travolta a household name. The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, featuring disco songs by the Bee Gees, became the best selling soundtrack ever.\n\nThe film also showcased aspects of the music, the dancing, and the subculture surrounding the disco era: symphony-orchestrated melodies, haute-couture styles of clothing, sexual promiscuity, and graceful choreography.\n\nThe story is based upon a 1976 New York magazine article by British writer Nik Cohn, &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night.&quot; In the late-1990s, Cohn acknowledged that the article had been fabricated[1]. A newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle, Cohn was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about. The characters who were to become Tony Manero and his friends sprang almost completely from his imagination.\n\nThe film is also notable for being one of the first instances of cross-media marketing, with the tie-in soundtrack&amp;#039;s single being used to help promote the film before its release and the film popularizing the entire soundtrack after its release.\n\nDirected by John Badham \nProduced by Robert Stigwood \nWritten by Nik Cohn (magazine article)\nNorman Wexler \nStarring John Travolta\nKaren Lynn Gorney \nMusic by Barry Gibb\nMaurice Gibb\nRobin Gibb\nDavid Shire \n\nRelease date(s) December 14, 1977\nRunning time 119 min\n\nLength.......................: 119 min\nResolution...................: 640 x 368\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 1390 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nBitrate......................: 320 kBit/s\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd4393aa4cbda8efd91305c870e53343a6c40b9","amp;dn":"Saturday+Night+Fever+%281977%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd4393aa4cbda8efd91305c870e53343a6c40b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,212,57,58,164,203,218,142,253,145,48,92,135,14,83,52,58,108,64,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
