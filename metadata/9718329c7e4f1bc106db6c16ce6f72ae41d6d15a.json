Put together on a college campus by a couple of rock critics, it maintained a close relationship with a series of literary figures (often in the fields of science fiction and horror), including Eric Von Lustbader, Patti Smith, Michael Moorcock, and Stephen King, while turning out some of the more listenable metal music of the early and mid-'70s. The band that became Blue Oyster Cult was organized in 1967 at Stony Brook College on Long Island by students (and later rock critics) Sandy Pearlman and Richard Meltzer as Soft White Underbelly and consisted of Andy Winters (bass), Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (guitar), John Wiesenthal -- quickly replaced by Allen Lanier -- (keyboards), and Albert Bouchard (drums), with Pearlman managing and Pearlman and Meltzer writing songs. Initially without a lead singer, they added Les Bronstein on vocals. This quintet signed to Elektra Records and recorded an album that was never released. They then dropped Bronstein and replaced him with their road manager, Eric Bloom, as the band's name was changed to Oaxaca. A second Elektra album also went unreleased, though a single was issued under the name the Stalk-Forrest Group. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia/Legacy\nCatalog:\t\tCOL 495243 2\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Cities On Flame With Rock And Roll\n02.The Red &amp; The Black\n03.Flaming Telepaths\n04.Astronomy\n05.This Ain't The Summer Of Love\n06.(Don't Fear) The Reaper\n07.I Love The Night\n08.Goin' Through The Motions\n09.Godzilla\n10.In Thee\n11.The Marshall Plan\n12.Black Blade\n13.Joan Crawford\n14.Burnin' For You\n15.Shooting Shark\n16.Take Me Away\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9718329c7e4f1bc106db6c16ce6f72ae41d6d15a","amp;dn":"Blue+Oyster+Cult+-+Best+Of+B.O.C.+%282000%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9718329c7e4f1bc106db6c16ce6f72ae41d6d15a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,24,50,156,126,79,27,193,6,219,108,22,206,111,114,174,65,214,209,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
