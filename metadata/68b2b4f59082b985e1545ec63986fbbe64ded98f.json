Shares a meal? Gets drenched in a sudden rain shower? Often, there is much more going on in a novel or poem than is readily visible on the surface -- a symbol, maybe, that remains elusive, or an unexpected twist on a character -- and there's that sneaking suspicion that the deeper meaning of a literary text keeps escaping you.\n\nIn this practical and amusing guide to literature, Thomas C. Foster shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock those hidden truths, and to discover a world where a road leads to a quest; a shared meal may signify a communion; and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just rain. Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices, and form, How to Read Literature Like a Professor is the perfect companion for making your reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.\n\nIncludes both .azw and .mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b2b4f59082b985e1545ec63986fbbe64ded98f","amp;dn":"How+to+Read+Literature+Like+a+Professor+-+Foster%2C+Thomas+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b2b4f59082b985e1545ec63986fbbe64ded98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,178,180,245,144,130,185,133,225,84,94,198,57,134,251,190,100,222,217,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
