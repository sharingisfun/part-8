Maybe it's overexposed because of the\r\nway your camera metered. Or maybe it's just bland\r\nNot to worry. With Photoshop you can replace a sky that\r\ndoesn't work with one that does. In this course\r\nphotographer, author, and educator Sean Duggan shows you\r\nhow to perform this common compositing task. You'll see\r\nexamples of sky replacements that don't work, and then\r\nlearn how to create ones that do.
