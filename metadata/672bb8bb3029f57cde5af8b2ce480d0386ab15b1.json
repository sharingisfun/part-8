With an even-tempered but crackling tone, Byrd could (and did) shine (and swing) alongside icons Hank Mobley and Horace Silver. \n\nThe Cat Walk is from the early 1960s, when he co-led a quintet with the fabulous, burly-sounding, and somewhat underrated baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams. Byrd combined the passionate technique of hard bop with the funkier aspects of soul-jazz for a series of smart, vibrantly engaging discs for Blue Note throughout the early and middle 1960s, with The Cat Walk being among the finest.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel: Donald Byrd (trumpet), Pepper Adams (bar.sax), Duke Pearson (piano), Laymon Jackson (bass), Philly Joe Jones (drums)\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
