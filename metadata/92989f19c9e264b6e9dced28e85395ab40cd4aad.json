It was the first album released on Rawkus Records, arguably the most popular and successful independent hip hop label of the late 1990s. Extremely well received - in the East Coast independent hip-hop community - the record is considered influential, but ultimately failed to significantly penetrate into market demographics outside of &quot;independent East Coast hip-hop,&quot; that is to say, Funcrusher Plus did not see much mainstream play.\n\nBitrate: 256kbps\nRipped from my CD\n\nTracklisting: \n\n1.
