Indebted to the wrong people and with his life on the line, DeWitt has only one opportunity to wipe his slate clean. He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT BioShock Infinite Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ \n\nIf you encounter problems playing the game, please visit support.aspyr.com.
