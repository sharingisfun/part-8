Greenaway explains the background, the context, the conspiracy, the murder and the motives of all its 34 painted characters who have conspired to kill for their combined self-advantage. Greenaway leads us through Rembrandt's paintings into 17th century Amsterdam. He paints a world that is democratic in principle, but is almost entirely ruled by twelve families. The notion exists of these regents as charitable and compassionate beings. However, reality was different.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1bc8a57985b24384767638a292f9dfbd1ca9803","amp;dn":"Rembrandt%27s+J%27accuse+%282008%29+DVDRip+%28Rus%2C+Eng%29+EngSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1bc8a57985b24384767638a292f9dfbd1ca9803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,188,138,87,152,91,36,56,71,103,99,138,41,47,157,251,209,202,152,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
