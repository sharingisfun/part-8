Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers).\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tNaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve (France)\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Mystery Of Love\n02.My Friends Have\n03.Crazy Love\n04.Last Song\n05.No Child Of Mine\n06.Before The Poison\n07.There Is A Ghost\n08.In The Factory\n09.Desperanto\n10.City Of Quartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                      ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a1446161063d9c613d6519de65ded45313f4a29","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+Before+The+Poison+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a1446161063d9c613d6519de65ded45313f4a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,20,70,22,16,99,217,198,19,214,81,157,230,93,237,69,49,63,74,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
