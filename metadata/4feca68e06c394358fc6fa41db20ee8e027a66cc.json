Another unavailable album to date.\n\n\nFloating in on the last wings of Britpop, this Southern California band named after a Northern California college town (or singer James Grundler's nursery school, depending on who you ask) is out of time and out of step. Yet, they create some of the dreamiest pop to emerge on the U.S. side of the pond in recent years. Winsome, anguished, and brainy, Paloalto conjures up the spirit of both Pink Floyd and Radiohead in their introspective epics of triumph and self-determination. Gorgeous, buzzing guitars, sleight-of-hand drumming, and extravagant instrumentation create a lush, swelling wall of sound from which Grundler's fragile voice emerges like a ghostly specter, chiseling out affirmations and grave pronouncements with a haunted gentility. --Jaan Uhelszki\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
