This outstanding work to go along with the road movie of all times, &quot;Until The End Of The World,&quot; by wunder director, Wim Wenders, went beyond where most soundtracks had gone before it came out (1991) and set the pace for great soundtracks to come later on (The Insider, Traffic and others).\nSimply put the soundtrack gathered the cream of the music scene: opening and closing tracks in charge of Graeme Revell/David Darling; mood swings in charge of Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, Elvis Costello, Lou Reed, REM, Nick Cave, Patti Smith, Daniel Lanois and U2, among others; and one of the most beautiful songs of all times, &quot;Calling All Angels&quot; by Canadian Jane Siberry, topping it all.\n\nThe one big missing song from this album is the very special version of &quot;Blood Of Eden&quot; that Peter Gabriel rearranged for this movie, in one of its most beautiful moments: when Solveig Dommartin and William Hurt's plane peacefully lands after all electronic devices fail to operate due to a nuclear explosion. Otherwise, it's one of those perfect soundtracks.\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - Until The End Of The World\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Until The End Of The World\nGenre................: General Film Music\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1991\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 247kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
