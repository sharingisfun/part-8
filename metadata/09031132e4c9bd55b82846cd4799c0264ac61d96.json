Uncover the actual stories and characters behind classic films including\n\n\n1)  Escape from Alcatraz \nUncover the true story behind the most famous prison break in American history. Alcatraz was the world's most impregnable prison-until three inmates escaped. Despite a vast manhunt, the men were never seen again. Did the prisoners actually make it off the island, or did the icy waters of the San Francisco Bay act as the fortress' last line of inescapable defence?\n\n2)  Indiana Jones \nJust who was the real Indiana Jones? Indy's creators George Lucas and Steven Spielberg say the inspiration for the whip-cracking adventurer came from the explorers featured in 1930s and 40s movie serials. In turn, many writers of these serials say their inspiration came from the real-life adventures of Roy Chapman Andrews. Another source for the Indy legend is the German scholar and Grail-hunter, Otto Rahn. Both embody the spirit of Indiana Jones, and lived real lives of scholarship, exploration and danger.\n\n3)  James Bond \nBond...James Bond. Is this man of mystery a personification of a real spy or a fantasy spun by author Ian Fleming? Fleming wanted his suave secret agent to be the ultimate spy - but who provided the inspiration? Discover Fleming's wartime service in naval intelligence, and meet two men who could have supplied the basis for Bond's character. Uncover the facts behind the fiction - the people, places and even the gadgets that inspired the iconic spy.\n\n4)  The Untouchables \nAl Capone was a notorious Mafia boss who thrived during the Prohibition era of 1930s Chicago. In the film &quot;The Untouchables,&quot; he was brought down by a small group of gritty law enforcers led by Eliot Ness. The public believed that Ness and his Untouchables were responsible for Capone's downfall, but that's not the real story. The Internal Revenue Service recently opened secret documents surrounding the case, including highly classified objects such as Capone's gun and Ness's diary. See the full story behind the plot to capture Capone.\n\n5)  The Bourne Identity \nBelieve it or not, the covert, violent, and deadly world of Jason Bourne is actually grounded in reality. We take an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the CIA to see how a super assassin like Matt Damon's conflicted hero is created. We also probe the intelligence agency's controversial past operations, involving sinister mind-control experiments and often bizarre assassination plots.\n\n6)  Casino \nBehind Martin Scorsese's masterful direction and Robert De Niro's larger-than-life performance lie's the very real story of the high-stakes battle between the mob and the law for control of Las Vegas. We interview key figures on both sides of this colourful crime story and detail how the FBI was finally able to overcome the Mafia's formidable grip on Sin City.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/4612/thetruestoryseries1scre.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/7523/thetruestoryseries1screj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/7523/thetruestoryseries1screj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4f072628270f037c617e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2014 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: average: 691 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.co.uk/shows/the-true-story/episode-guide.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.co.uk/shows/the-true-story/episode-guide.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09031132e4c9bd55b82846cd4799c0264ac61d96","amp;dn":"History+Ch+The+True+Story+Series+1+1of6+Escape+from+Alcatraz+PDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09031132e4c9bd55b82846cd4799c0264ac61d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,3,17,50,228,201,189,85,184,40,70,205,71,153,192,38,74,198,29,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
