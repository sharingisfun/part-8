But you wonâ€™t know whyâ€¦\r\n\r\nIâ€™m thinking of ending things. Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It lingers. Itâ€™s always there. Always.\r\n\r\nJake once said, â€œSometimes a thought is closer to truth, to reality, than an action. You can say anything, you can do anything, but you canâ€™t fake a thought.â€\r\n\r\nAnd hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking: I donâ€™t want to be here.\r\n\r\nIn this deeply suspenseful and irresistibly unnerving debut novel, a man and his girlfriend are on their way to a secluded farm. When the two take an unexpected detour, she is left stranded in a deserted high school, wondering if there is any escape at all. What follows is a twisted unraveling that will haunt you long after the last page is turned.\r\n\r\nIn this smart, suspenseful, and intense literary thriller, debut novelist Iain Reid explores the depths of the human psyche, questioning consciousness, free will, the value of relationships, fear, and the limitations of solitude. Reminiscent of Jose Saramagoâ€™s early work, Michel Faberâ€™s cult classic Under the Skin, and Lionel Shriverâ€™s We Need to Talk about Kevin, Iâ€™m Thinking of Ending Things is an edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, this novel pulls you in from the very first pageâ€¦and never lets you go. \r\n\r\nFormat: M4B\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df920dc0b2ffecda4c4bac78c2e1997a77c6dde9","amp;dn":"Iain+Reid+-+I%27m+Thinking+of+Ending+Things","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df920dc0b2ffecda4c4bac78c2e1997a77c6dde9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,146,13,192,178,255,236,218,76,75,172,120,194,225,153,122,119,198,221,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
