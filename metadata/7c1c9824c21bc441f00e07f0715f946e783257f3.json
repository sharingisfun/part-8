Gass - Fiction &amp; Non-Fiction (5 books)\n\nWILLIAM H. GASS (b. 1924) is an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, critic, and former philosophy professor.  Gass typically devotes enormous attention to sentence construction, and his prose has been variously described as flashy, difficult, edgy, masterful, inventive, and musical.  In an interview, Gass commented on the subject of his genre and form-defying works, laughing off the title &quot;Postmodern,&quot; and coining himself &quot;Late&quot; or &quot;Decayed Modern&quot;.\n\nFiction\n\nCARTESIAN SONATA &amp; OTHER NOVELLAS (1998) presents four interrelated novellas that explore Mind, Matter, and God.\n\nIn the novel MIDDLE C (2013), Gass presents a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life -- futile, comic, anarchic -- arranged in an array of vocabularies, altered rhythms, forms, and tones, with music as both theme and structure.  Joseph Skizzen leads a resolutely ordinary life but one that is built on a scaffold of forgery and deceit.  MIDDLE C tells the story of his journey, a story that is also an investigation into the nature of identity and the ways in which each of us is several selves.\n\nNon-Fiction\n\nTHE WORLD WITHIN THE WORLD (1978) considers the works, lives, preoccupations, and achievements of Valery, Freud, Stein, Sartre, Henry Miller, Joyce, Rilke, Proust, Nabokov, Faulkner, Colette, and other modern writers.\n\nON BEING BLUE (1991) is an improvisational inquiry into the nature of words and consciousness, using as its departure point the concept of the color blue -- the idea of blue, the state of blue, the uses of blue . . . the bluenesses of blue.\n\nIn READING RILKE (1999), Gass reflects on the art of translation and on Rainer Maria Rilke's &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;, providing his own translation of Rilke's masterwork.\n\n\nThe following books are a mix of PDF and ePUB formats:\n\n* CARTESIAN SONATA &amp; OTHER NOVELLAS (Basic Books, 1998) -- PDF\n\n* MIDDLE C (Knopf, 2013) -- ePUB\n\n* ON BEING BLUE: A Philosophical Inquiry (David R.
