No query about life or the universe is too random or silly for science adventurer Greg Foot. So if you've ever wondered why the sky is blue, how to survive a lightning strike, or even how many helium balloons it takes to lift a human, then this is the show for you.\nSecrets of Everything uses brilliantly simple lo-fi demonstrations, hi-tech kit and extreme stunts to explore the weird science behind everything from belly flops to black holes, Greg turns non-scientists into eager enthusiasts and reveals just how mysterious and incredible our world really is.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nDaredevil science geek Greg Foot is prepared to attempt anything to find answers to some of life's weirder frequently-asked questions. In the first episode of this irreverent, stunt-filled series, Greg suffers to find out what humans taste of, heads to Reading Festival to work out whether the human race could actually shift the planet by jumping at exactly the same time, and finds out whether a bellyflop could kill you.\nAlong the way he is struck by lightning and 'goes to the moon' using helium balloons. It's science - but not as you know it.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nSelf-confessed science geek Greg Foot continues his adrenaline-fuelled odyssey to find answers to life's frequently-asked questions. He discovers whether there's any truth to the urban legend that you could survive in a falling lift if you jump as it hits the ground. He is prepared to sacrifice his friends in an eye-watering expose of what makes chillies hot and, with the help of a human substitute, he finds out what happens to our bodies when we die. Other secrets shared see Greg fire-walking and trying to survive an asteroid attack, while 70s throwback Professor Logic discovers the shortest route around the world.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nBBC Three's first science series marches on with self-confessed science geek Greg Foot leading the way. Greg squares up to champion cage fighter Rosie Sexton and friends to discover if winning unfair fights only happens in the movies. He asks perhaps the ultimate science question - why is the sky blue? - Before probing the urban legend that your eyeballs fall out if you sneeze with your eyes open. And, as if that was not enough, Greg experiences the highs and lows of surviving on your own bodily fluids. Not your average half hour in front of the telly!\n\n4)  Part 4 \n'In Kill Bill, Uma Thurman was buried alive and escaped. But that was in the movies...' says BBC Three's science geek, Greg Foot. You know what's coming next - and you won't be disappointed! As well as being buried, Greg discovers what he needs to become the fastest man on the planet, works out why a boomerang comes back and finds out why bulletproof vests are actually bulletproof. And if you've ever wondered whether water drains out of the sink the other way Down Under... watch this space\n\n5)  Part 5 \nIf a penny falls off the top of the Empire State Building and hits someone on the pavement, will it kill them? Science geek and adrenaline junkie Greg Foot lives to risk his neck and get to the bottom of such things. Greg comes under sustained attack - he's immersed in cold water to discover what extreme temperature can do to you and has his fingers hammered to test a weird painkiller. And then he investigates spontaneous human combustion. Curiouser and curiouser...\n\n6)  Part 6 \nThe last episode sees self-confessed science geek and adrenaline junkie Greg under pressure as he and an inflatable friend attempt to dig to Australia. He will stop at nothing to answer some of life's weirder frequently asked questions and is sucked into quicksand to discover if it is as deadly as the movies make out. He eats a stupefying amount of fast food to see just how quickly you can get fat without really trying and, with the help of a pig, finds out whether it is physically possible to die of a broken heart.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/7331/mj0r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/7331/mj0r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/5138/8kfk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/5138/8kfk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/938/zqug.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/938/zqug.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/6358/kpyr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/6358/kpyr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/zuxz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/zuxz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1883/kcqz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/1883/kcqz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/7450/t2s7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img200.imageshack.us/img200/7450/t2s7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4032/zho6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/4032/zho6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/9675/p3s9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/9675/p3s9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;91d9f8f6f9d1dda5bfa0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2169 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 29mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 442 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d7mms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01d7mms&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:104bc6e0f2b002002d1917e5daa051074c2f088d","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Secrets+of+Everything+5of6+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"104bc6e0f2b002002d1917e5daa051074c2f088d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,75,198,224,242,176,2,0,45,25,23,229,218,160,81,7,76,47,8,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
