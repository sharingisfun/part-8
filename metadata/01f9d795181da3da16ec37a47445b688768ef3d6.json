He defines two aspects of cynicism; one, an &quot;enlightened false consciousness,&quot; akin to Marx's alienation, which pervades modern society; the other, a species of critical reason first exemplified by Diogenes. Sloterdijk is clearly indebted to Hegel, Nietzsche, and Horkheimer, but his discursive method will appeal to scholars of literary criticism rather than social science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f9d795181da3da16ec37a47445b688768ef3d6","amp;dn":"Peter++Sloterdijk+-+Critique+of+Cynical+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f9d795181da3da16ec37a47445b688768ef3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,249,215,149,24,29,163,218,22,236,55,164,116,69,182,136,118,142,243,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
