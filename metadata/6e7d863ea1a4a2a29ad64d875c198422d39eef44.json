This ancient book is also central in Chinese religion, not only for Taoism but Chinese Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including poets, painters, calligraphers, and even gardeners have used the Tao Te Ching as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, aided by hundreds of translations into Western languages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7d863ea1a4a2a29ad64d875c198422d39eef44","amp;dn":"Tao+Te+Ching+by+Laozi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e7d863ea1a4a2a29ad64d875c198422d39eef44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,125,134,62,161,164,162,162,154,214,77,135,92,25,132,34,211,158,239,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
