In the security settings, you will be able to put private mode, you can change the tracking parameters. In the Tools section, subsection Block content, as I understand it, we are talking about the Adblock, only I could not configure it, do not quite understand how it works, so advertising is displayed everywhere. \r\nIn general, there is nothing to tell me more about the program, if you have anything to add, please comment, I hope together we can help developers, all the luck. \r\n\r\nDeveloper: bajasoft, emdek \r\nLicense: FreeWare \r\nLanguage: English + Multi \r\nOS: Windows \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install:[/b]\r\n\r\n1).
