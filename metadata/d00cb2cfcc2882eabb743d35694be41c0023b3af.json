Lodge (CRC, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nâ€œHighly recommended!â€ â€“ CHOICE\r\nNew Edition Offers Improved Framework for Understanding Polymers\r\n\r\nWritten by well-established professors in the field, Polymer Chemistry, Second Edition provides a well-rounded and articulate examination of polymer properties at the molecular level. It focuses on fundamental principles based on underlying chemical structures, polymer synthesis, characterization, and properties.\r\n\r\nConsistent with the previous edition, the authors emphasize the logical progression of concepts, rather than presenting just a catalog of facts. The book covers topics that appear prominently in current polymer science journals. It also provides mathematical tools as needed, and fully derived problems for advanced calculations. This new edition integrates new theories and experiments made possible by advances in instrumentation. It adds new chapters on controlled polymerization and chain conformations while expanding and updating material on topics such as catalysis and synthesis, viscoelasticity, rubber elasticity, glass transition, crystallization, solution properties, thermodynamics, and light scattering.\r\n\r\nPolymer Chemistry, Second Edition offers a logical presentation of topics that can be scaled to meet the needs of introductory as well as more advanced courses in chemistry, materials science, and chemical engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00cb2cfcc2882eabb743d35694be41c0023b3af","amp;dn":"Polymer+Chemistry+2nd+ed+-+Paul+C.+Hiemenz+and+Timothy+P.+Lodge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00cb2cfcc2882eabb743d35694be41c0023b3af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,12,178,207,204,40,130,234,187,116,61,53,105,75,228,28,0,35,179,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
