In this course, photographer and author Ben Long explores the concepts of composition, from basics such as the rule of thirds to more advanced topics such as the way the eye travels through a photo.\n\nThe course addresses how the camera differs from the eye and introduces composition fundamentals, such as balance and point of view. Ben also examines the importance of geometry, light, and color in composition, and looks at how composition can be improved with a variety of post-production techniques. Interspersed throughout the course are workshop sessions that capture the creative energy of a group of photography students; shooting assignments and exercises; and analyses of the work of photographers Paul Taggart and Connie Imboden.\nTopics include:\nLooking versus seeing\nUnderstanding when and why to use black and white\nAnalyzing lines\nArranging the elements into lines and shapes\nWorking with perspective and symmetry\nChanging focal length, camera position, and depth\nDividing rectangular frames into thirds\nWeighting the corners in square pictures\nComposing photographs of people\nComposing landscape photos\nWorking with light: direction, texture, and negative space\nHow to shoot color\nGuiding the viewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye\nControlling depth\nImproving composition in post-production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a2312e451f10f73c457de46ed50fb5667a2f85","amp;dn":"Lynda+Foundation+Of+Photography+Composition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a2312e451f10f73c457de46ed50fb5667a2f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,162,49,46,69,31,16,247,60,69,125,228,110,213,15,181,102,122,47,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
