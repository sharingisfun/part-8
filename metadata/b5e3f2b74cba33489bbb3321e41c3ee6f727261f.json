Dial in the perfect rhythm with rugged 808 sub-bass kicks, rapid-fire pitched snare rolls, time-stretched hats, and ultra-intense drops. Skittering, psychedelic effects, and pitched vocals add the final touches.\n\nSpecial Vocal Loop and Snare Roll kits let you freestyle with ease. And MASSIVE brings the heavy with screaming, layered synth leads and wall-shaking, sweeping sub-basses to keep those bodies moving.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstall:\n\n1. Take the unzipped library and drop it in your Maschine directory (usually Macintosh HD /Users/Shared/).\n\n2. Open Maschine and go to preferences, library and select the expansion you just dropped into your directory. Click on it and hit RESCAN on the bottom right. It should work perfect.\n\nHINT: Intially you may have to 'find missing sample' and find some 'kick.wav' file inside the library. Do that and it should work perfectly.\n\n3. Hit that plus button.\n\n4. Enjoy!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e3f2b74cba33489bbb3321e41c3ee6f727261f","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Lazer+Dice+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e3f2b74cba33489bbb3321e41c3ee6f727261f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,227,242,183,76,186,51,72,155,187,51,33,228,28,62,230,247,39,38,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
