Released in 1998 for Windows and Mac OS, it was co-developed by Saffire and Blizzard Entertainment. The expansion pack introduced new campaigns, map tilesets, music, extra units for each race, and upgrade advancements. The campaigns continue the story from where the original StarCraft ended,[1] with the sequel StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty continuing from the conclusion of Brood War. The expansion was released in the United States on 30 November 1998.[2]\n\nBrood War was critically well-received, with reviewers praising it for being developed with the care of a full game rather than as an uninspired extra.[3][4][5] As of 31 May 2007, StarCraft and Brood War have sold almost ten million copies combined.[6] The game is especially popular in South Korea, where professional players and teams participate in matches, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised matches.\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\n    90 MHz processor for Windows\n    120 Mhz processor for Mac OS\n    SVGA video card or equivalent\n    16MB RAM (32MB recommended)\n    DirectX version 2.0 or better\n    80MB of disk space\n\nDeveloper(s) \tBlizzard Entertainment\n\nMass Media Interactive\nEntertainment\n(Nintendo 64 version)\nPublisher(s) \tWindows, Mac OS\n\n    NA Blizzard Entertainment\n\n    PAL Sierra Entertainment\n\nNintendo 64\nNintendo\nDesigner(s) \tChris Metzen\nJames Phinney\nComposer(s) \tDerek Duke\nJason Hayes\nGlenn Stafford\nSeries \tStarCraft\nVersion \t1.16.1[1]\n(21 January 2009)\nPlatform(s) \tWindows, Mac OS, Nintendo 64\nRelease date(s) \tWindows\n\n31 March 1998[2]\nMac OS\nMarch 1999\nNintendo 64\n\n    NA 13 June 2000[3]\n\n    AUS 16 June 2000[3]\n\nGenre(s) \tReal-time strategy\nMode(s) \tSingle-player, multiplayer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fc0e96eedf86a1666aac1e7aa36d2f42466908d","amp;dn":"StarCraft+plus+BroodWar+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fc0e96eedf86a1666aac1e7aa36d2f42466908d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,192,233,110,237,248,106,22,102,170,193,231,170,54,210,244,36,102,144,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
