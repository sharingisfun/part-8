Twenty-eight topics are covered in specially written surveys by leading figures in their fields: each gives an authoritative map of the ethical terrain, explaining how the debate has developed in recent years, engaging critically with the most notable work in the area, and pointing directions for future work. The Handbook will be essential reading, and a fascinating resource of ideas and information, for academics and students across a wide range of disciplines.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e7bfd0ce34bb2798945b37498e75e107ab2895","amp;dn":"The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Practical_Ethics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e7bfd0ce34bb2798945b37498e75e107ab2895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,231,191,208,206,52,187,39,152,148,91,55,73,142,117,225,7,171,40,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
