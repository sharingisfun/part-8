Richard Lance (Gregory Peck) is unjustly held responsible, by his men &amp; girlfriend, for an Indian massacre death of beloved Lt. Holloway. Holloway (Gig Young) is killed while escorting a dangerous Indian chief to another fort's prison. The chief escapes. Knowing their fort is in danger of Indian attack, Lance takes a small group of army misfits to an abandoned nearby army fort to defend a mountain pass against the oncoming Indian assault. Their mission is to stall for time until reinforcements from another fort arrive. The men in this small group of malcontents, deserters, psychopaths &amp; cowards all hate Capt. Lance &amp; wish him dead. Much to their chagrin, the men recognize that Lance's survival instincts, military knowledge &amp; leadership are the only chance the group has of staying alive.\n\nVideo: XVID 640x480 23.98fps 793Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio 44100Hz stereo 127Kbps\nRunning time: 1:44:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586a8b9b879e3d8db789eed7868c8dd548148fb9","amp;dn":"Only+the+Valiant+%281951%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586a8b9b879e3d8db789eed7868c8dd548148fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,106,139,155,135,158,61,141,183,137,238,215,134,140,141,213,72,20,143,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
