These video tutorials are provided free of charge, and we hope you enjoy and benefit from them.\n\nVideo Tutorials by Blender Underground\nBlender Basics Part 1 - This first installment of the Blender Basics Video Tutorial series introduces the user to BlenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interface, preferences, and basic navigation. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re new to Blender, start with this lesson. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just over an hour, and will help you get comfortable with BlenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interface and some of its conventions.\n\nStartup Scene - 01:20\nPreferences - 03:02\nSaving Settings - 06:37\nInterface - 07:43\nNavigating 3D - 16:29\nLayers - 20:18\nManipulating Objects - 23:34\n3D Transform Manipulators - 32:56\nOrigin Point - 42:30\nPivot Modes - 46:33\nViewport Shading - 55:20\n\nBlender Basics Part 2 - The second video tutorial of the series delves a little more deeply into BlenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s objects, and deals with smoothing and the Subsurf modifier, which is one of the most useful mesh modifiers in existence. This tutorial finishes by introducing the user to Edit Mode, where all the mesh editing magic happens.\n\nCreating Objects - 01:47\nSet Smooth - 15:02\nSubsurf - 22:00\nEdit Mode - 39:09\n\nBlender Basics Part 3 This third part of the Blender Basics series of video tutorials gets serious by looking under the hood of Subsurf usage and some of its advanced features. The Edge Split modifier is also introduced as well as some utilitarian practices regarding polygonal meshes, namely merging vertices and extruding geometry. To help solidify whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been learned thus far, a simple model tutoral is provided at the end of the lesson.\n\nAdvanced Subsurf - 01:09\nSubsurf Creasing - 14:55\nAdvanced Smoothing - 26:22\nMerging Vertices - 35:42\nEdge Split Modifier - 40:48\nExtrusions - 46:43\nA Simple Model - 55:11\n\nBlender Basics Part 3 Supplemental - This supplement to Part 3 brings into focus features introduced in earlier lessons. This is the result of feedback from several users regarding usage of elements touched upon previously in the series, and makes clear some nifty elements left out of Parts 1-3, such as the Bounding Box Pivot Mode, and a powerful shortcut to using Loop Cut.\n\nPivot mode: Bounding Box - 01:12\nMake Edge/Face - 04:48\nLoopcut and Subdivide Multi - 08:37\nSelect Linked Geometry - 11:14\n\nBlender Basics Part 4 - The fourth installment in Blender UndergroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beginner video tutorial series deals with a more abstract aspect of Blender, the relationships of objects and data. While this lesson is a mild departure from the previous segments, it deals with subjects that will make advancing the userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understanding of Blender not only possible, but easier. Take the time to work through this lesson and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find that understanding how Blender deals with data relationships will give you important insights into how Blender works, making more advanced topics easier to understand.\n\nThe Outliner - 01:16\nMesh Data - 08:13\nOOPS Schematic - 17:32\nLinked Duplicates - 37:36\nMultiple Scenes - 46:31\n\nBlog Post: Blender Tutorial Release Part 4\nBlender Basics Part 5 - This installment of the series lays a foundation for understanding the Materials panel. Beginning with explanation on the diffuse shader, this tutorial advances to cover the switches and dials of Materials, followed by a lengthy look at Raytracing. Ramp shaders are also covered, long with a brief tutorial on assigning multiple materials.\n\nAbout Shaders - 01:38\nShader Types - 16:18\nMaterial Settings - 30:18\nPipeline Settings - 39:15\nRaytracing - 50:23\nRamp Shaders - 1:22:40\nMultiple Materials - 1:38:36\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc2c906665b3d4e3737242204cf9eec0229299d","amp;dn":"blenderunderground.com+-+Blender+Video+Tutorials+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc2c906665b3d4e3737242204cf9eec0229299d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,194,201,6,102,91,61,78,55,55,36,34,4,207,158,236,2,41,41,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
