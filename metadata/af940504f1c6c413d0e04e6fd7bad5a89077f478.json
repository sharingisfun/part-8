Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written.\n\nFranklin's account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different periods at which he wrote them. There are actual breaks in the narrative between the first three parts, but Part Three's narrative continues into Part Four without an authorial break.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af940504f1c6c413d0e04e6fd7bad5a89077f478","amp;dn":"The+Autobiography+of+Benjamin+Franklin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af940504f1c6c413d0e04e6fd7bad5a89077f478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,148,5,4,241,198,196,19,208,224,78,111,215,186,213,168,144,119,244,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
