He is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century popular music and was renowned for his vocals and feverish dancing. He was also called &quot;the hardest working man in show business&quot;.\n\nAs a prolific singer, songwriter, dancer and bandleader, Brown was a pivotal force in the music industry. He left his mark on numerous artists. Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¹jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1956 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. In spite of various personal problems and setbacks he continued to score hits in every decade through the 1980s. In addition to his acclaim in music, Brown was also a presence in American political affairs during the 1960s and 1970s. Brown was recognized by numerous titles, including Soul Brother Number One, Sex Machine, Mr. Dynamite, The Hardest Working Man in Show Business, The King of Funk, Minister of The New New Super Heavy Funk, Mr. Please Please Please Please Her, I Feel Good, and foremost The Godfather of Soul. In Sweet Soul Music by Arthur Conley, he is described as the King of Soul.\nBrown's career spanned decades, and profoundly influenced the development of many different musical genres. Brown moves on a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly Africanised approach to music making. Brown performed in concerts, first making his rounds across the &quot;chitlin' circuit&quot;, and then across the country and later around the world, along with appearing in shows on television and in movies. Although he contributed much to the music world through his hitmaking, Brown held the record as the artist who charted the most singles on the Billboard Hot 100 without ever hitting number one on that chart.\nFor many years, Brown's touring show was one of the most extravagant productions in American popular music. At the time of Brown's death, his band included three guitarists, two bass guitar players, two drummers, three horns and a percussionist. The bands that he maintained during the late 1960s and 1970s were of comparable size, and the bands also included a three-piece amplified string section that played during ballads. Brown employed between 40 and 50 people for the James Brown Revue, and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country, performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as one-nighters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7fe6fe400bd8725c37aa93a7bd0c9257802d79e","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+The+Gold+Collection+-+2+Cd+%281998%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7fe6fe400bd8725c37aa93a7bd0c9257802d79e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,254,111,228,0,189,135,37,195,122,169,58,123,208,201,37,120,2,215,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
