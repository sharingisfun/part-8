Foreigner's leader from the beginning has been British guitarist Mick Jones, who first broke into the music biz as a &quot;hired gun&quot; of sorts, appearing on recordings by George Harrison and Peter Frampton, and as part of a later-day version of hard rockers Spooky Tooth. By the mid-'70s, Jones had relocated to New York City, where he was a brief member of the Leslie West Band and served as an A&amp;R man for a record company. But it wasn't long before Jones felt the urge to be part of another rock outfit as he sought to put together a band that would be able to combine elements of rock, progressive, R&amp;B, and pop into a single, cohesive style.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/foreigner-p4296/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/foreigner-p4296/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nLike any other entry in Rhino's Complete Greatest Hits series, Foreigner's Complete Greatest Hits does contain all the group's charting hits, from &quot;Feels Like the First Time&quot; to &quot;Say You Will.&quot; This makes it more comprehensive than almost any of the other Foreigner compilations -- yes, the double-disc Jukebox Heroes has more material, yet this is concise in its completeness. This doesn't capture their peak as well as Records, but it does cover more ground, which means it has &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; and &quot;Say You Will,&quot; among other late-'80s hits. Yes, it doesn't have &quot;Midnight Blue,&quot; unlike Jukebox Heroes, but that is, after all, a Lou Gramm solo hit. If you're looking for all of the hits by Foreigner proper, this is indeed the way to go, since it has all of them on one disc, with nice sound and packaging -- just like the Complete Greatest Hits series promises.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-greatest-hits-r587305&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-greatest-hits-r587305&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000065DWB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000065DWB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
