Chapter 1 is titled &quot;Stopping Iran,&quot; focused on nuclear threats, and then readers are taken through the entire history. The authors wrote a national best seller, EVERY SPY A PRINCE, about Israeli intelligence, in 1990. This non-fiction -- which reads like a thriller -- brings us to the dangerous challenges and innovative solutions of today. Best-selling spy novelist Daniel Silva writes: &quot;Buyer beware: Once you crack the cover of Spies Against Armageddon, you won't be able to put it down. It is much more than simply the most authoritative book ever written about Israeli intelligence. It is storytelling and drama of the highest order.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15843661b52dc4b46857c3c2baf14a3d1cb83c27","amp;dn":"Dan+Raviv+-+Spies+Against+Armageddon.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15843661b52dc4b46857c3c2baf14a3d1cb83c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,132,54,97,181,45,196,180,104,87,195,194,186,241,74,61,28,184,60,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
