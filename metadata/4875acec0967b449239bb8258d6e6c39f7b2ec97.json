The band split up after Schuldiner's death in 2001.\n-------------------------------\nThe Sound of Perseverance is the seventh and final studio album by American band Death. This album, in particular, employs a style more akin to progressive metal than the earliest Death releases, although since Human and the albums following it, the band had been developing more toward this style. The average song length on this album is around six minutes. The music has a unique and notorious sound, characterized on melodic harmonies and &quot;heroic&quot; guitar riffs between Schuldiner and Hamm. Also, it was a breakthrough album for drummer and later radio star Richard Christy, a fan favorite, in the tradition of previous drummers like Gene Hoglan and Sean Reinert.\n--------------------------------\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Scavenger of Human Sorrow&quot; - 6:54\n   2. &quot;Bite the Pain&quot; - 4:29\n   3. &quot;Spirit Crusher&quot; - 6:44\n   4. &quot;Story to Tell&quot; - 6:34\n   5. &quot;Flesh and the Power It Holds&quot; - 8:25\n   6. &quot;Voice of the Soul&quot; - 3:42 (Instrumental)\n   7. &quot;To Forgive Is to Suffer&quot; - 5:55\n   8. &quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; - 7:22\n   9. &quot;Painkiller&quot; (Judas Priest cover) - 6:03\n---------------------------------\nCredits\n\n    * Chuck Schuldiner - vocals, guitar, acoustic guitar on Voice of the Soul\n    * Richard Christy - drums\n    * Scott Clendenin - bass\n    * Shannon Hamm - guitar\n---------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4875acec0967b449239bb8258d6e6c39f7b2ec97","amp;dn":"Death+-+1998+-+The+Sound+Of+Perseverance+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4875acec0967b449239bb8258d6e6c39f7b2ec97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,117,172,236,9,103,180,73,35,155,184,37,141,110,108,57,247,178,236,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
