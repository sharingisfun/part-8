HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built clouds. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solved real business problems using this technology. This book is important to the emerging world of cloud computing with real world guidance on how to succeed with cloud computing the first time. It should be required reading for anyone moving to the cloud.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€David Linthicum, SVP Cloud Technology Partners, Author, Speaker, Blogger, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“B List GeekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is an important book for a number of reasons. The cloud is a transformational force in IT and Mike captures the forces at play and explains the impact in business and technical terms. The book covers the challenges we technologists face and the benefits businesses can realize. This book is not about products. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about architecture. It will not be dated with the next new thing. The book explains what needs to be done to transform a business to a modern-cloud architecture in terms of people, processes, and technology.\n\nThe cloud is a disruptive technology. There will be winners and losers. Do yourself a favor and read this book and position yourself and your company to be a winner with a proper cloud roadmap and architecture as outlined in this excellent book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Eric Roch, Principal Architect and Leader of the SOA and Cloud Practice for the IT consultancy Perficient Inc.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We live in an era which many pundits bemoan as lacking in economic vigor. Mike Kavis, however, sees something entirely different: amazing opportunities bubbling beneath the surface and ready to explode across the business landscape. He says we have entered a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgolden era of innovation,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and he is spot on. Never before have so many resources been available to successfully launch and run a business, at relatively little cost. We are seeing an entire generation of businesses and business leaders coming on the scene who know only cloud, and are able to quickly experiment or act on new ideas, moving nimbly through their markets. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a world for startups, as larger enterprises are also learning to embrace Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcloud culture.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ But, as with any promising technology, it takes a keen sense of architecture and understanding of the organization to get it right. In this book, Mike provides a roadmapÃ¢â‚¬â€and inspirationÃ¢â‚¬â€to begin the journey to become a cloud-enabled enterprise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Joe McKendrick, independent analyst and contributor to Forbes and CBS interactive ZDNet\nAbout the Author\n\nMICHAEL J.
