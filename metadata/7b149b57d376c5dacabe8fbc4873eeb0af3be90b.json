Change notes and game info below\n\nPatch 1.6 Notes\n\n- Added a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Very LowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ graphics setting to enable the game to run on lower performance GPUs. This disables MSAA and grass (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dependent on it) and disables fading between LOD levels. \n- Added grass draw distance slider - note that the HIGH setting now uses more computer performance. \n- Fixed Alt+Tab crash on some systems. \n- Fixed a very rare startup crash. \n- Fixes some cases where the game started to main menu but users could not select any menu entries. This was caused by the keybinds.xml being corrupted. \n- Fixed some cases of handling custom My Documents paths where game could crash if that was mapped to the root of a drive. \n- Fixed the minor DLC1 Ã¢â‚¬Å“black cubes in the mirrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ graphical glitch.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/alan_wake&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/alan_wake&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhat's cool about it:\nIncludes Alan Wake Special Episodes Ã¢â‚¬Å“The SignalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WriterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nINTENSE CINEMATIC ACTION Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Remedy, the masters of cinematic action, comes a 3rd person action game filled with overwhelming odds and desperate near escapes\nRAZOR SHARP SUSPENSE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gripping storytelling at its best, Alan Wake is like a tightly paced thriller TV series, offering endless twists and cliffhangers, and building up to an epic conclusion\nLIGHT IS YOUR WEAPON Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Light is your greatest weapon and only protection as darkness takes over everything and everyone, and turns them against you\n\n\nWhen the wife of the best-selling writer Alan Wake disappears on their vacation, his search turns up pages from a thriller he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even remember writing.
