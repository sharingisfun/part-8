For their 2005 album Wake the Dead, they signed to Victory Records internationally, and to Smallman Records in Canada. Wake the Dead has now sold over 100,000 copies and was voted Alternative Press's 100 bands to know in 2005, Chart MagazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top 100 albums of 2005, favorite CD in Uptown Magazine, and nominated for Best Hardcore Group at the Indie Awards at Canadian Music Week, and also for the CBC Galaxie Rising Star Award.\n\nIn 2006, lead singer Scott Wade left the band to pursue other interests and guitarist Andrew Neufeld took over lead vocals. The current tour line-up features Andrew Neufeld (vocals), Jeremy Hiebert (guitar), Kyle Profeta (drums), Matthew Keil (bass), and Casey Hjelmberg (guitar).\n\nOn February 20, 2007, Comeback Kid released BroadcastingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ (Victory / Smallman), their most diverse album yet. Recorded again with Bill Stevenson (All, Descendents) at The Blasting Room, the album encompasses both heavier and more melodic elements. As lead singer Andrew Neufeld explains, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe wanted to up the ante with this one. I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great to explore new things and push the envelope a bit.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBroadcastingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ is a superbly crafted, hard-hitting tour de force. Described by Neufeld, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the darkest record we have ever written. We were going for a more epic, full sounding album. It has the classic CBK elements but everything is turned up a notch.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nPlease Seed After Download!!\n\nRequests Welcome!!\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:607af08d3197c05cd9c0b1cb4f15c8ac781f47e2","amp;dn":"Comeback+Kid+Discography+inc.+demo+%5BK-BOMB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"607af08d3197c05cd9c0b1cb4f15c8ac781f47e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,122,240,141,49,151,192,92,217,192,177,203,79,21,200,172,120,31,71,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
