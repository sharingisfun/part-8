Damn, I love those X Force guys!  Here's the Autodesk Maya 2014 Extension SP1 for Mac.  If you already have Autodesk Maya 2014 SP3 (NOT Extension)or earlier and it was a gift from XForce, just plug and play.\n\nI know that this is common knowledge; however, I'll throw it out there anyway:  After you have taken your Maya education to a place where you can start to earn some kind of living from it, please consider buying the program.  These guys that build this software work hard to bring us a good product.  Programmers aren't like the music and movie industry thugs.  That's the end of my preachy faggotry.\n\nAgain, this version is for Mac.  Thanks X-Force!  And to TPB:  tack sÃƒÂ¥ mycket! \n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Features\n\nThe Extension for AutodeskÃ‚Â® MayaÃ‚Â® 2014 software brings you the power of some of the industryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best technology, with new tools and enhancements that help you more easily create the complex, high-quality assets required by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demanding productions. With the XGen Arbitrary Primitive Generator for creating hair, fur, feathers, grass, foliage, and other instanced data; a new retopology toolset; new robust and efficient Boolean operations; and enhancements to the Bullet physics plug-in, the Extension for Maya 2014 delivers increased productivity to modelers, animators, and effects artists.\n\nXGen Arbitrary Primitive Generator\n\nWith the extension for Maya 2014, you get access to the XGen Arbitrary Primitive Generator technology used by Walt Disney Animation Studios in the hit animated films Tangled, and Bolt, and by Pixar Animation Studios in Toy Story 3.  XGen enables you to generate curves, spheres, and custom geometry on the surface of polygon meshes in order to create and groom hair, fur, and feathers on characters, and quickly populate large landscapes with grass, foliage, trees, rocks, and debris trails. With geometry created procedurally at render time, XGen enables you to handle large amounts of instanced data that would slow down a system if loaded in memory. The rendered effect can be previewed interactively in the Maya Viewport 2.0 hardware-accelerated display; you can control the appearance and behavior of the primitives by setting attributes, painting maps, creating expressions, or using the included XGroom interactive grooming toolset; long hair can be controlled by creating guide hairs, which can be simulated using the Maya nHair toolset.\n\nNew Retopology Toolset\n\nThe NEX modeling technology first integrated in Autodesk Maya 2014 software has been further extended to offer a streamlined workflow for retopologizing meshes; the Quad Draw tool now integrates a new Relax and Tweak feature with Soft Selection, and a new interactive Edge Extend tool. You can now optimize your meshes for cleaner deformations and better performance from a single toolset within Maya.\n\nBetter Booleans\n\nMaya now employs a robust and efficient new library for faster and more reliable Boolean operations on polygon geometry. The new technology has been extensively tested and optimized on a number of complex high-resolution datasets, and delivers dependable results on open surfaces.\n\nBullet Physics Enhancements\n\nThe Extension for Maya 2014 delivers several enhancements to the Bullet plug-in that enables you to use the open source Bullet physics engine to create large-scale, highly realistic dynamic and kinematic simulations within Maya. Delivered in conjunction with AMD (Advanced Micro Devices), the Bullet plug-in now offers the ability to create compound collision shapes from multiple meshes; produces better collisions with concave shapes, thanks to a new Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition (HACD) algorithm; integrates with Maya Forces; and support rigid sets for increased scalability.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96932d246b23a740867852492c180b7d37fc472a","amp;dn":"Autodesk+Maya+2014+Extension+SP1+-+Mac+-+X-Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96932d246b23a740867852492c180b7d37fc472a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,147,45,36,107,35,167,64,134,120,82,73,44,24,11,125,55,252,71,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
