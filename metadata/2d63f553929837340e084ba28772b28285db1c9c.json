He was life the way it was supposed to be all those years ago. That's what all the Returned were.\n\nHarold and Lucille Hargrave's lives have been both joyful and sorrowful in the decades since their only son, Jacob, died tragically at his eighth birthday party in 1966. In their old age they've settled comfortably into life without him, their wounds tempered through the grace of time ... Until one day Jacob mysteriously appears on their doorstepÃ¢â‚¬â€flesh and blood, their sweet, precocious child, still eight years old.\n\nAll over the world people's loved ones are returning from beyond. No one knows how or why this is happening, whether it's a miracle or a sign of the end. Not even Harold and Lucille can agree on whether the boy is real or a wondrous imitation, but one thing they know for sure: he's their son. As chaos erupts around the globe, the newly reunited Hargrave family finds itself at the center of a community on the brink of collapse, forced to navigate a mysterious new reality and a conflict that threatens to unravel the very meaning of what it is to be human.\n\nWith spare, elegant prose and searing emotional depth, award-winning poet Jason Mott explores timeless questions of faith and morality, love and responsibility. A spellbinding and stunning debut, The Returned is an unforgettable story that marks the arrival of an important new voice in contemporary fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d63f553929837340e084ba28772b28285db1c9c","amp;dn":"The+Returned+-+Jason+Mott.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d63f553929837340e084ba28772b28285db1c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,99,245,83,146,152,55,52,14,8,75,162,135,114,178,130,133,219,28,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
