Among the major changes to the character, Wonder Woman now appears wearing a new costume similar to her older one, and has a completely new origin. In this new timeline, Wonder Woman is no longer a clay figure brought to life by the magic of the gods, but the demigoddess daughter of Queen Hippolyta and Zeus, king of the Greek Gods. Currently, Diana has taken on the role and title as the new &quot;God of War&quot;.\n\nThe Greek messenger god, Hermes, entrusts Wonder Woman with the protection of Zola, a young woman, who is pregnant with Zeus's child, from Hera, seething with jealousy and determined to kill the child. With the appearance of a bizarre, new, chalk-white enemy, the goddess Strife, Wonder Woman discovers she, herself, is the natural-born daughter of Hippolyta and Zeus, who, after a violent clash, became lovers.  Hippolyta revealed Diana's earlier origin story to be a lie, spread amongst the Amazons to protect Diana from the wrath of Hera, who is known for hunting and killing several illegitimate offspring of Zeus.\n\nThe first of these half-mortal siblings to reveal himself to Wonder Woman was her older half-brother, Lennox Sandsmark, who could transform himself into living, marble-like stone and, before his death, was revealed to be the father of Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark).\n\nThe story then focuses on Wonder Woman's quest to rescue Zola from Hades, who had abducted her and taken her to Hell at the end of the sixth issue of the series.  The male children of the Amazons are introduced and Diana learns about the birth of her &quot;brothers&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Amazons used to infrequently invade ships coming near their island and force themselves on the sailors, before killing them. After nine months, the birth of the resulting female children was highly celebrated and they were inducted into the ranks of the Amazons while the male children were rejected. In order to save the male children from being drowned to death by the Amazons, Hephaestus traded them from the Amazons in exchange for weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to ShiningKnight and Avalon for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76eca92fdbc3f2d9545357dca5913adf96ac70dd","amp;dn":"Wonder+Woman+%2852+Universe%29+0-33+%28Digital%29+%28Shining+Knight-SCC-No","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76eca92fdbc3f2d9545357dca5913adf96ac70dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,236,169,47,219,195,242,217,84,83,87,220,165,145,58,223,150,172,112,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
