Like any child, Chappie will come under the influence of his surroundings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some good, some bad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he will rely on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing that makes Chappie different from anyone else: he is a robot. The first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. His life, his story, will change the way the world looks at robots and humans forever.\n\n\nRating: 7.3/10 (33657 votes)\nDirector: Neill Blomkamp\nWriter: Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell\nStars: Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser\nRuntime: 120 min\nRated: R\nGenre: Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller\n\n\nSize: 1850MB\nVideo: MPEG-4 | 1920Ãƒâ€”800 | 2069 Kbps\nAudio: English | AAC 2Ch | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 2h 00mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac51670dd83b5c84d1c6566ef8b0c3faf28fa15","amp;dn":"Chappie+%282015%29+BRRip+1080p+-+MrKickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac51670dd83b5c84d1c6566ef8b0c3faf28fa15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,197,22,112,221,131,181,200,77,28,101,102,239,139,12,63,175,40,250,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
