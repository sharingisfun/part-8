Then she sat down on the ladder-backed chair, put her face into her bloodied hands and cried. To the outside world, Cynthia Tailor is a woman to envy; she has a devoted husband, a lovely home and two gorgeous children. But Cynthia is deeply unhappy with her lot; she has always craved the best things in life, and is determined to see that she gets them. Cynthia will let nothing stand in her way, even if it means devastation and tragedy for those nearest to her. And the casualties are many: her husband Jimmy, weak and unable to fight the wife he can never please; her sister Celeste, from whom Cynthia steals her most precious possession; and her parents, Mary and Jack, who pick up the pieces. But the victims who suffer the most are Cynthia's children. For James Junior and Gabby, the pain she causes will stay with them for ever... \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7acaa1ed61a6fec604609f0c4c59e5f03eeba05d","amp;dn":"The+Faithless+-+Martina+Cole+++%28mobi+-+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7acaa1ed61a6fec604609f0c4c59e5f03eeba05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,202,161,237,97,166,254,198,4,96,159,12,76,89,229,240,62,235,160,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
