Due to the lack of strong melodies and the &quot;mood music&quot; nature of most of these selections (which work quite well in the two films but rarely stand alone), this set is of limited interest from the jazz standpoint. The Pawnbroker, in addition to a stirring monologue by Rod Steiger taken from the film, has some short spots for trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and trombonist J.J. Johnson in addition to a vocal by Marc Allen; Sarah Vaughan's version of the &quot;Theme from the Pawnbroker&quot; is added to the program. The Deadly Affair, which has a vocal by Astrud Gilberto, sometimes features an unidentified tenor saxophonist and is generally of lesser interest. This CD is more for film buffs than for jazz collectors. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nI'd already got this one though but what I DIDN'T know was that &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot;, (the 1964 Sidney Lumet movie starring Rod Steiger) was the first ever movie Q provided the score to. His FIRST EVER movie score. I find that amazing.\nIt's accompanied on this disc by the music from &quot;The Deadly Affair&quot; (also a Sidney Lumet movie from 1966, starring James Mason). Q combines his classical training he'd received in Paris in the 50s with his natural jazz instincts to create an hour or so (just over 68mins) of beautiful musical landscapes with lots of strings - which I always love. It's simply wonderful. If you enjoy orchestral music with a touch of jazz, you'll absolutely love this.
