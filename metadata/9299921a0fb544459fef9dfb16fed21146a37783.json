Heiser.\nHaunted by his parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ death and his career failures, Dr. Brian Scott has begun to settle for the life heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given.\nUntil heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kidnapped by military insiders known as The Group.\nDisappearances. Visitations. Murder.\nBrian and a team of world-class scholars are given a confidential mission: To prepare humanity for a new reality. They are here. But as the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement with extraterrestrials is revealed, strange things begin to happen.\nSomething isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t right. Unpeeling layer after layer of deception and counter-deception, Brian moves toward a shocking revelation that will forever alter how humanity sees itself.\nEvery document cited in The FaÃƒÂ§ade actually exists.\nEvery ancient text discussed in The FaÃƒÂ§ade is authentic.\nEvery historical figure referred to or quoted in The FaÃƒÂ§ade is real.\n\nThe Portent:\nAncient conspiracy. Relentless evil. The hunt for answers continues.\nThe climactic ending of The FaÃƒÂ§ade left Brian Scott and Melissa Kelley with only each other-and the terrible secrets they carry. The Portent finds them living under new identities, their future clouded by constant fear of being exposed. By the time Brian and Melissa learn they're being watched, their carefully constructed lives will be over.\nFollow Brian and Melissa into the center of an unthinkably vast, centuries-old conspiracy, conceived to turn the faith of millions against itself. Revelations from ancient tombs, long-forgotten Nazi experiments, UFOs, occult mythologies, biblical theology, and godlike technologies converge in answer to a terrifying question: Now that &quot;they&quot; are here, what do they want?\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nMike Heiser is a scholar in the fields of biblical studies and the ancient Near East.
