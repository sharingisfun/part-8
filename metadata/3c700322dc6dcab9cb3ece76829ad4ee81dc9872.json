Actually, the Scottish singer -- born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie -- had been a star in Britain since 1964, when she hit the Top Ten with a raucous version of &quot;Shout.&quot; Lulu's mid-'60s recordings (which included a version of &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; that preceded Them's hit rendition) were often surprisingly rowdy and R&amp;B-influenced. Although she didn't match Dusty Springfield, her Brenda Lee-like rasp could be quite gutsy and soulful. Her career was headed in a determinedly middle-of-the-road direction by the late '60s, which saw her hosting a British variety show and marrying Bee Gee Maurice Gibb (they later divorced). Lulu raised a few eyebrows by traveling to Muscle Shoals studios to record her 1970 album New Routes and releasing a double-sided single of David Bowie tunes (which Bowie also played on and co-produced) in 1973. Lulu has recorded intermittently ever since -- her well-received 2004 album Back on Track coincided with a U.K. tour marking 40 years since her first appearance on the charts -- and she also continues to make TV and radio appearances in the U.K.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lulu-p19043/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lulu-p19043/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lulu-the-gold-collection-r535765&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/lulu-the-gold-collection-r535765&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000071PW&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000071PW&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
