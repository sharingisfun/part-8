Great scenes involve her cop-proof apartment, and the motormouth Tourette Syndrome sufferer played by Goldthwait -- if you want raunchy ringtones, scavenge this movie for audio clips.\n\nSource: eMule AVI of unknown origin; full-screen (no WS version has been released); 560x416 XviD, 117Kbps vbr mp3. I adjusted aspect ratio to 4x3 using MPEG4Modifier, and remuxed in AVImuxGUI to shave a few MB off file-size.\n\nIMDB review: Author: vb1der (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4e382c7f2a2b3c0e2f2122602d2123&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) from Richmond, VA\n\nBurglar is one of the movies on my top 50 funniest movie list. Unlike other reviews here, I rate it higher than Jumping Jack Flash. Perhaps its because this is a great movie for Bobcat&amp;#039;s normally irritating character. Strange that there are no quotes for this movie! She and Bobcat have some truly great (although obscene) lines. Whoopie&amp;#039;s scene in the closet while the soon-to-be-murdered character was screwing his ex-wife is hilarious. Bobcat has great scenes in the bar delivering a package, and later being interrogated by John Goodman in the police station.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c274b4cf5a7d5b69d15aca64d54cca4fb9de7b88","amp;dn":"Burglar+1987+Whoopi+Goldberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c274b4cf5a7d5b69d15aca64d54cca4fb9de7b88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,116,180,207,90,125,91,105,209,90,202,100,213,76,202,79,185,222,123,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
