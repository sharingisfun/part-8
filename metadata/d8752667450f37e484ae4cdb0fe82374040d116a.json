Indeed, although assembled as a sort of Icelandic indie supergroup, Kukl never made music that could be deemed in any way accessible; on first listen, The Eye is a patently draining affair seemingly devoid of any coherent structure. Repeated spins, however, unearth a highly sophisticated aesthetic that borrows evenly from punk, noisecore, avant garde, and good old-fashioned indie. Although highly discordant and often atonal, it&amp;#039;s a curiously engaging record, aided in part by BjÃƒÂ¶rk&amp;#039;s darkly emotive vocals and the presiding, almost mythical, sense of impending lunacy. It may not be for everyone, but this is gutsy, non-conformist music as authored by one of the most passionate, intense bands in Iceland&amp;#039;s esteemed history.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8752667450f37e484ae4cdb0fe82374040d116a","amp;dn":"KUKL+%28bjork+pre+sugarcubes%29+-+The+Eye+%281984%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8752667450f37e484ae4cdb0fe82374040d116a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,117,38,103,69,15,55,228,132,174,76,219,15,232,35,116,4,13,17,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
