The OST was released on two discs, ~Deus~ and ~Povo~, with another disc, ~Melodia~, being packed with the limited edition of the game. This torrent also includes songs from the bonus disc, and represents the highest quality MP3s I could find.\n\n~Deus~ and ~Povo~ were converted to high-quality MP3 from FLAC and songs vary between 260-320kbps. ~Melodia~ is lower quality (120-210kbps), and the bonus disc is all 320kbps.\n\n-\n\nPlease continue to share this music for future listeners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ace4aee6ec269f561c83471c40e6b70687b501b4","amp;dn":"Grandia+II+OSTs+%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ace4aee6ec269f561c83471c40e6b70687b501b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,228,174,230,236,38,159,86,28,131,71,28,64,230,183,6,135,181,1,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
