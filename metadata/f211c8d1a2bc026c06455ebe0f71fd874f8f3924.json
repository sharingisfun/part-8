Director, James Fox assembled the most credible UFO witnesses from around the world to testify at The National Press Club in Washington D.C.: Air Force Generals, astronauts, military and commercial pilots, government and FAA officials from seven countries tell stories that, as Governor Fife Symington from Arizona stated, &quot;will challenge your reality&quot;.\n\n\nTheir accounts reveal a behind-the-scenes U.S. operation whose policy is to confiscate and hoard substantiating evidence from close encounters to the extent that even Presidents have failed to get straight answers. I KNOW WHAT I SAW exposes reasons behind government secrecy from those involved at the highest level. \n\n\nAdditionally, because of the strength of his ratings and the high level of interest from his audience, Larry King has indicated to James Fox an interest in promoting I KNOW WHAT I SAW. With the worldwide unrelenting UFO fascination and the phenomenal success of fictional UFO films, it is high time for an up-to-date documentary about UFOs for worldwide release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosted by: James Fox\n====================\n\n\nDirected by: James Fox\n======================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    I Know What I Saw\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:30:22\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    592x336\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1085 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    701 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1579236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1579236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ***  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f211c8d1a2bc026c06455ebe0f71fd874f8f3924","amp;dn":"I+Know+What+I+Saw-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f211c8d1a2bc026c06455ebe0f71fd874f8f3924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,17,200,209,162,188,2,108,6,69,94,190,15,113,253,135,79,143,57,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
