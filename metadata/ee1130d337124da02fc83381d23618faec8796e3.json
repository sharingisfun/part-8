Yes, this is a mighty fine read, and deWitt a mighty fine writer. --National Post\n\nIn The Sisters Brothers, a diabolical combination of Laurel and Hardy and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (with a touch of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, just to emphasise the high literary stakes) deWitt has ensured another unforgettable pair their place in fictive lore. -- The Telegraph \n\n\nShortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2011. Hermann Kermit Warm is going to die. The enigmatic and powerful man known only as the Commodore has ordered it, and his henchmen, Eli and Charlie Sisters, will make sure of it. Though Eli doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t share his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s appetite for whiskey and killing, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never known anything else. But their prey isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an easy mark, and on the road from Oregon City to WarmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gold-mining claim outside Sacramento, Eli begins to question what he does for a living Ã¢â‚¬â€ and whom he does it for. With The Sisters Brothers, Patrick deWitt pays homage to the classic Western, transforming it into an unforgettable comic tour de force. Filled with a remarkable cast of characters Ã¢â‚¬â€ losers, cheaters, and neÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er-do-wells from all stripes of life Ã¢â‚¬â€ and told by a complex and compelling narrator, it is a violent, lustful odyssey through the underworld of the 1850s frontier that beautifully captures the humour, melancholy, and grit of the Old West and two brothers bound by blood, violence, and love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee1130d337124da02fc83381d23618faec8796e3","amp;dn":"The+Sisters+Brothers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee1130d337124da02fc83381d23618faec8796e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,17,48,211,55,18,77,160,47,200,51,129,210,54,24,250,236,135,150,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
