By the end\nof the ?80s, however, the band ? whose music was instantly recognizable from Mark King?s thumb-slap\nbass technique and associate member Wally Badarou?s synthesizer flourishes ? had crossed over to the\npoint where they were often classified as sophisti-pop and dance-rock, equally likely to be placed in the\ncontext of Sade and the Style Council as any group that made polished, upbeat, danceable pop/rock.\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Level 42\nAlbum: Lessons In Love: The Collection\nGenre: Jazz / Rock / Funk / Soul / Pop / 80s\nSource: Double CD\nAlbum Release Year: 2010\nLabel: Spectrum Music\nBarcode: 600753308400\nCatalog No: SPECXX2052\nNumber of Tracks: 31\nTotal Duration: 02:33:01\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.3.1\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 943 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps [Constant Bit Rate]\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 [Stereo]\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\n\nAudio File ID Tags [FLAC]: VorbisComment\nAudio File ID Tags [MP3]: id3v2.3, id3v1\nIncluded Artwork: Front and back booklet plus inlay\nAdditional Files: Log, Cue, MD5, SFV, FFP, Txt, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.36 GB\n\n\nTrack List - CD1\n\n01.
