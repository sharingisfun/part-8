Using the life of Stilwell, Barbara W. Tuchman explores the history of China from the Revolution of 1911 to the turmoil of World War II, when China's Nationalist government faced attack from both Japanese invaders and Communist insurgents. Her classic, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of the cantankerous but level-headed &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; is both an account of American relations with China and the experiences of one of our men on the ground.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15aa35571182741dac606ee14542fa0a7e217a64","amp;dn":"Barbara+W.+Tuchman+-+Stilwell+in+China+%5B1971+Pulitzer+Prize%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15aa35571182741dac606ee14542fa0a7e217a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,170,53,87,17,130,116,29,172,96,110,225,69,66,250,10,126,33,122,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
