Reisley and J. Timpane, &quot;Usonia, New York: Building a Community with Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; \nEnglish | ISBN: 1568982453 | 2001 | 192 pages | PDF | 14 MB\n\n&quot;Usonia, New York&quot; is the story of a group of idealistic men and women who, following WWII, enlisted Frank Lloyd Wright to design and help them build a cooperative utopian community near Pleasantville, NY. Through both historic memorabilia and contemporary color photos, this book reveals the still-thriving community based on concepts Wright advocated in his Broadacre City proposals.

Reisley, one of the original members of Usonia (and still a resident), has written the first full account to illuminate the events, problems, and passions of a democratic group of people developing a designed environment an hour from New York City and the ups and downs of working with America's most famous -and most famously volatile-architect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e95632074c7156ea163fd9c58274d43399fb93","amp;dn":"Usonia%2C+New+York+-+Building+a+Community+with+Frank+Lloyd+Wright+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e95632074c7156ea163fd9c58274d43399fb93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,233,86,50,7,76,113,86,234,22,63,217,197,130,116,212,51,153,251,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
