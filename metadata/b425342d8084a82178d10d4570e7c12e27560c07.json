Join Jeremy as he travels across the country to experience a wide array of animal jobs, including bear tattooer, camel milker, mounted cop, wild beehive re-locator, horse logger, falconer, lobsterman and worm chef-and the Americans who keep these careers and traditions alive.\nJeremy quickly learns the ropes from the unsung folks whose work makes life better for the rest of us. They'll take Jeremy by the hand and give him a crash course in creatures and a B.A. in beasts, all the while instilling the lessons of safety and respect that these animals deserve.\nWitness Jeremy's close encounters with every fun and fascinating, dirty and dangerous animal job out there... from California, Texas, Florida, Vermont, all the way to Maine. We'll find new wild jobs for him, involving massive beasts, pretentious pets, impossibly slippery critters, and the amazingly adept pros who work with them every day.\n\n\n1)  The Lion Dentist \nDo you have what it takes to give a 400-pound lion a physical exam? In Florida, host Jeremy Brandt does the unthinkable: sticking his hand down a lion's throat. After a close encounter with the park's chimpanzees, he gets a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform a neonatal exam on a baby giraffe. Even though it's only one day old, the giraffe is already over 6 feet tall! Next, he tries his hand at goat ranching before boarding a shrimping boat in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n2)  The Camel Milk Man \nIn Santa Barbara, Calif., Jeremy works closely with a bee rescuer to transfer a hive that's taken up residence inside the walls of a family home to a nearby apiary. Jeremy then apprentices at a Westlake, Calif., veterinary hospital, where he performs a routine checkup on a 12-foot python. But his most ambitious undertaking occurs at the Oasis Camel Dairy in San Diego, where he assists a young bull camel in mating with an older female.\n\n3)  The Hog Fixer \nJust what is horse logging? Jeremy Brandt is about to find out! He takes part in the centuries-old method of transporting logs by rigging a 100-foot tree to a 2,000-pound horse! Next up, Jeremy spends the day with the Marine Mammal Stranding Network in Oregon, where they investigate a dead seal mystery. It's a nasty job; they have to peel off the animal's fur in order to examine a bullet wound. Finally, at a free-range pig farm Jeremy's first job is to catch two baby pigs for castration.\n\n4)  The Ostrich Cowboy \nJeremy Brandt travels to three unusual Texas ranches where he faces off with real &quot;angry birds,&quot; makes a good old-fashioned worm pasture, and gives a cow a pedicure. At the Jurassic Ranch he &quot;saddles up&quot; with modern-day cowboys to wrangle a herd of ostriches. At the Texas Worm Ranch, he concocts worm food by mixing horse manure and rotten fruit. Jeremy's final visit is to the cattle of the Lazy D Farm, where he gives their prize-winning show cows a pedicure.\n\n5)  The Black Bear Catcher \nJeremy Brandt's first stop in northern Maine, where he assists local researchers in trapping and tracking black bears, by preparing smelly baits of road kill and beaver blood. Next, Jeremy ventures to Vermont to experience how a high-tech, high-volume dairy farm operates. Jeremy's last stop is in Portland, Maine, where before he can catch a lobster, he has to make the bait, so Jeremy joins a crew of dockworkers as they unload tons of pogies, an oily, bony fish.\n\n6)  The Shark Tank Cleaner \nJobs That Bite! takes a bite out of the Big Apple. At the Long Island Aquarium Jeremy feeds full-grown sand tiger sharks -- over 9-feet long and always hungry. In a rare behind-the-scenes moment, cameras capture one of the bigger sharks violently bumping a cameraman. Next, Jeremy meets Brooklyn's premier pigeon breeder who raises 400 birds on his rooftop. Then, he mounts up with the Central Park police to experience the challenge of being on horseback in one of the world's most crowded parks.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3853/fgrg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3853/fgrg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/911/f6uy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/911/f6uy.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/7513/tkb6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/7513/tkb6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6623/biyxc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6623/biyxc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2134/cxou.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/2134/cxou.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3433/wijg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3433/wijg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/1748/lr24.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/1748/lr24.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8303/fxp7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8303/fxp7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6703/7sun.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/6703/7sun.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/6731/0yp7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/6731/0yp7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/8149/2waj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/8149/2waj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/267/c7kp0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/267/c7kp0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d098b9b7b8909ce4fee1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3174 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 985 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/jobs-that-bite/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/jobs-that-bite/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b425342d8084a82178d10d4570e7c12e27560c07","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Jobs+That+Bite+Series+1+2of6+The+Camel+Milk+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b425342d8084a82178d10d4570e7c12e27560c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,37,52,45,128,132,168,33,120,209,13,69,112,231,193,46,39,86,12,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
