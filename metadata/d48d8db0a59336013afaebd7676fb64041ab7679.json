The discussions are concise, practical, specific, and problem-based so the book directly addresses the situations and issues faced by the clinical pathologist or other manager or staff member of the chemistry team. Discussion of each problem is augmented by a case discussion giving a real-world example of how the issue can occur and how it can be effectively dealt with by the manager. The goal is to support the pathologist, manager or technologist in providing the highest possible quality of care and effective, timely consultation to the clinical staff.\n\nClinical Chemistry: Diagnostic Standards of Care features:\n\nComprehensive coverage of key issues in achieving quality in all areas of clinical chemistry\nIncludes chapters dedicated to point of care testing, pediatric testing, laboratory information systems and EHR integration, and outreach testing\nNumerous case examples and discussions give real-world illustrations of how problems occur and how to avoid them\nCoverage includes perspectives from the lab manager's and administrator's view\nAn emphasis on identifying established, evidence-based standards in clinical chemistry\nExamples of errors which compromise patient safety across all major areas of clinical chemistry\nPocket-sized for portability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48d8db0a59336013afaebd7676fb64041ab7679","amp;dn":"Clinical+Chemistry%2C+Quality+in+Labratory+Diagnosis+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48d8db0a59336013afaebd7676fb64041ab7679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,141,141,176,165,147,54,1,58,250,235,215,103,111,182,64,65,171,118,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
