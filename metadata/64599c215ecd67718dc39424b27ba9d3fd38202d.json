Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64599c215ecd67718dc39424b27ba9d3fd38202d","amp;dn":"Packing+for+Mars+-+Mary+Roach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64599c215ecd67718dc39424b27ba9d3fd38202d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,89,156,33,94,205,103,113,141,195,148,36,178,123,169,211,253,56,32,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
