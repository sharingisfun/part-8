Even though he and his \nwife, Emily Shelby, believe that they have a benevolent relationship \nwith their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling \ntwo of them---Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and \nHarry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza---to a slave trader. Emily \nShelby hates the idea of doing this because she had promised her maid \nthat her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to \nsee Tom go because he sees the old man as his friend and mentor. \n\nWhen Uncle Tom's Cabin was published in 1852, it became an international \nblockbuster, selling more than 300,000 copies in the United States alone \nin its first year. Progressive for her time, Harriet Beecher Stowe was \none of the earliest writers to offer a shockingly realistic depiction of \nslavery. Her stirring indictment and portrait of human dignity in the \nmost inhumane circumstances enlightened hundreds of thousands of people \nby revealing the human costs of slavery, which had until then been \ncloaked and justified by the racist misperceptions of the time. \n - - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nStowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Academy and an \nactive abolitionist, focused the novel on the character of Uncle Tom, a \nlong-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other \ncharactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½both fellow slaves and slave ownersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½revolve. The sentimental \nnovel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian \nlove can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow \nhuman beings.\n\nUncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, and \nthe second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible. It is \ncredited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. In the \nfirst year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold \nin the United States alone. In 1855, three years after it was published, \nit was called &quot;the most popular novel of our day.&quot; The impact attributed \nto the book is great, reinforced by a story that when Abraham Lincoln \nmet Stowe at the start of the Civil War, Lincoln declared, &quot;So this is \nthe little lady who made this big war.&quot; The quote is apocryphal; it did \nnot appear in print until 1896, and it has been argued that &quot;The \nlong-term durability of Lincoln's greeting as an anecdote in literary \nstudies and Stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the \ndesire among many contemporary intellectuals... to affirm the role of \nliterature as an agent of social change.&quot; \n\nThe book, and even more the plays it inspired, also helped popularize a \nnumber of stereotypes about black people, many of which endure to this \nday. These include the affectionate, dark-skinned &quot;mammy&quot;; the \n&quot;pickaninny&quot; stereotype of black children; and the Uncle Tom, or \ndutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or \nmistress. In recent years, the negative associations with Uncle Tom's \nCabin have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book \nas a &quot;vital antislavery tool.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ee96262337fa3ee0c699bf9ff8ec9201e62cf3","amp;dn":"UNCLE+TOM%5C%27S+CABIN+-+Harriet+Beecher+Stow.+Richard+Allen+%7BFerraB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ee96262337fa3ee0c699bf9ff8ec9201e62cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,238,150,38,35,55,250,62,224,198,153,191,159,248,236,146,1,230,44,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
