THESIS (TESIS) is the story of Angela (Ana Torrent-Spirit of the Beehive, Cria), a university student who is writing a thesis on violence in the media. During her research, she comes across a &quot;snuff film,&quot; a film in which a murder has actually been committed. She discovers that not only has the film been shot on the university campus itself, but she uncovers clues that the university's administrators may be involved in a series of student disappearances, leading her to the ultimate find: she might be the next victim. A superbly constructed thriller that generates edge-of-your-seat suspense through the final scene!\n\n1996 | 121 minutes | Color | Thriller | Spanish w/English subtitles | Rated R\n\nCast (in credits order)\n\t\nAna Torrent - ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½ngela\nFele MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­nez - Chema\nEduardo Noriega - Bosco\nXabier Elorriaga - Castro\nMiguel Picazo - Figueroa\nNieves Herranz - Sena\nRosa Campillo - Yolanda\nPaco HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez - Padre Angela (as Francisco HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ndez)\nRosa ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½vila - Madre Angela\nTeresa Castanedo - Presentadora T.V.\nJosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Miguel Caballero - Conserje Videoteca\nJoserra CadiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±anos - Vigilante\nJulio VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lez - Encargado tren\nPilar Ortega - Encargada C.
