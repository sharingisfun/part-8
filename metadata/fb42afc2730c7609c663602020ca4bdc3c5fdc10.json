The series blends frenetic visual montages and anime subculture references. The series concerns a young boy named Gerald who is on a quest to find the perfect hair to remedy his premature baldness. He is joined on his wanderings by an array of strange companions. Gerald is opposed by the evil Coiffio and his minions for reasons which are never stated in the series. Perfect Hair Forever employs an ongoing serial format, a style that had been uncommon to previous Williams Street projects, due to their lack of emphasis on continuity. Each episode of the series thus far has featured different opening sequence music and visuals. The style and music of the end credits has also varied from episode to episode.\n\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Hair_Forever\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465849/\n\nCreators: Mike Lazzo, Matt Harrigan, Matt Maiellaro.\nWriters: Matt Harrigan, Michael Lazzo, Matt Maiellaro, Dave Willis.\nStarring: C.
