The series follows the exploits of recent New Jersey transplant Mondo and his new best friend Woodie as they live their life in Playa Del Toro, a fictional Southern California beach town.\n\nThe show was originally sold to Fox in 2008, and a pilot produced. When Fox passed, the producers looked for other buyers and in 2010 they received a series order at MTV. The pilot's voice cast came back. However, on February 24, 2012, MTV cancelled the series, just two days after Season 1 was released on DVD due to low ratings; MTV had discussed ways of bringing ratings up but decided to end the show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e051c97cc3d0fac4e8930fdbb98ef7937d70de","amp;dn":"MTV+Good+Vibes+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e051c97cc3d0fac4e8930fdbb98ef7937d70de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,224,81,201,124,195,208,250,196,232,147,15,219,185,142,247,147,125,112,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
