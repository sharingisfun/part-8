The song was released as a single in November 1967, and topped the charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Norway. The song also was a number two hit in both Austria and Switzerland.\n\nThough the songwriting credit is Lennon and McCartney, it was written solely by Paul McCartney.\n\nAlistair Taylor, who worked for the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, had asked McCartney how he wrote his songs, and McCartney took him into his dining room to give him a demonstration on his harmonium. He asked Taylor to shout the opposite of whatever he sang as he played the instrumentÃ¢â‚¬â€black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye. Taylor later said, &quot;I wonder whether Paul really made up that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.&quot;\n\nThree promotional films were made for the song; directed by McCartney, they were filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London. The films were not aired by the BBC due to the Musicians Union's strict rules on miming; with no such restriction in the US, one of the films was screened on The Ed Sullivan Show on 26 November.\n\nTwo of the films feature The Beatles wearing their Sgt. Pepper uniforms with hula girls dancing in front of a psychedelic backdrop. Both feature the last times they wore their 1963 grey Merseybeat suits, and one of the films is intercut with them dancing the Twist. Of passing interest is that the infamous black OPD cloth badge used to support the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; claims is nowhere to be seen on his sleeve.\n\nThe third film also has hula girls dancing about, with the Beatles in bright casual clothes of the period (except for John who is in a black and white suit). The background is of a vibrant rural scene. All three videos show a clean shaven Lennon without his granny glasses.\n\nIn May 2013, the Vox guitar played in the video by John Lennon on the Magical Mystery Tour album sold at auction for US$408,000 in New York.\n\n&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; topped the charts in the United States, becoming the band's 15th #1 there. It also topped the charts in Britain where it spent seven weeks at number one, and was the Christmas number one for 1967. John Lennon was not impressed with the popularity of the song, saying incredulously, &quot;'I Am the Walrus' was the B side to 'Hello, Goodbye'! Can you believe it?&quot;\n\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Goodbye&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Goodbye&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caGbFAAGa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/caGbFAAGa&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 7000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Duration: 00:03:32\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
