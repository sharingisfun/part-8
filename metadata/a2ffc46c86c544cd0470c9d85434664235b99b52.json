ABEE\n___\n\n\n[Cover Inside]\n\nAbout:\n__\n\nA groundbreaking collection of essays on the sex industry, Sex for Sale contains original studies on sex work, its risks and benefits, and its political implications. The book covers areas not commonly researched, including gay and lesbian pornography, telephone sex workers, customers of prostitutes, male and female escorts who work independently, street prostitution, sex tourism,\nlegal prostitution, and strip clubs that cater to women. The book also tracks various trends during the past decade, including the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mainstreamingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and growing acceptance of some types of sexual commerce and the growing criminalization of other types, such as sex trafficking. Sex for Sale offers a window into the lived experiences of sex workers as well as an analysis of the larger gender arrangements and political structures that shape the experiences\nof workers and their clients. The book greatly contributes to a growing research literature that documents the rich variation, nuances, and complexities in the exchange of sexual services, performances, and products. This book will change the way we understand sex work.\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPART I: PORNOGRAPHY\n\nPART I I: STR IPPING AND TE LEPHONE SEX\n\nPART I I I: PROSTITUTION\n\nPART IV: TRENDS\n\nPublished in 2010 by Routledge\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
