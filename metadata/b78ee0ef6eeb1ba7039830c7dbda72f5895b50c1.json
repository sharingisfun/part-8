It was very influential on music that was yet to come. This is a worthy re-issue, sounds GREAT and the bonus tracks are OK to Good to Spooky. Some versions of songs (&quot;Regiment&quot; is one)are longer than the 1981 versions, as a previously reviewer has noted. Anyone who is a fan of this seminal, brilliant collaboration of Eno and Byrne should have this CD, which expands it. My only complaint is that it doesn't include the track &quot;Qu'ran&quot; from the original album, so its not quite complete. Luckily, I already had the original version on CD. But I still highly recommend it. If you haven't heard this one yet, you're in for a treat.&quot;\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase. Well, you all know the drill :)\n\nRipped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s\nGet Your Free Copy of the EAC and FLAC suite at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/download/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease feel free to join the TQMP project!\nThe &quot;rules&quot; are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassettetapes or vinylrips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork.
