From there, we'll learn how to edit animation from Maya's Time Slider and Graph Editor.\n\nWe'll learn how to animate objects along a path, how to work non-destructively with animation layers, how to create animated thumbnails inside of our viewport with Maya's Grease Pencil tool, and how to animate with the Constraints. We'll even learn how to transfer animation between characters with the help of a few Character Sets and the Trax Editor.\n\nBy the end of this training, you'll have the understanding you need to animate comfortably inside of Maya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b5f3337ed15416e27186e810d4d4483ac3a353","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Animation+in+Maya+2015+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b5f3337ed15416e27186e810d4d4483ac3a353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,181,243,51,126,209,84,22,226,113,134,232,16,212,212,72,58,195,163,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
