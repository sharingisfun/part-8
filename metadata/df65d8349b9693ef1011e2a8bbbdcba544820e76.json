In contrast to other Motown groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas were known for a harder, R&amp;B sound, typified by &quot;(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave,&quot; &quot;Nowhere to Run,&quot; &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot; and, their signature song, &quot;Dancing in the Street.&quot;\nDuring their nine-year run on the charts from 1963 to 1972, Martha and the Vandellas charted over twenty-six hits and recorded in the styles of doo-wop, R&amp;B, pop, blues, rock and soul. Ten Vandellas songs reached the top ten of the Billboard R&amp;B singles chart, including two R&amp;B number ones. Twelve of the Vandellas' songs charted within the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, with six songs charting within the Top Ten including &quot;Dancing in the Street,&quot; &quot;Heat Wave,&quot; &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Mack.&quot;\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Martha and the Vandellas #96 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df65d8349b9693ef1011e2a8bbbdcba544820e76","amp;dn":"Martha+Reeves+%26+The+Vandellas+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df65d8349b9693ef1011e2a8bbbdcba544820e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,101,216,52,155,150,147,239,16,17,226,168,187,189,203,165,68,130,14,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
