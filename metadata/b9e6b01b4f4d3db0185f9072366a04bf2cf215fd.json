It developed in the UK over the 1980s and 1990s and could be seen as tacking the sound of jazz-funk onto electronic dance: jazz-funk musicians such as Roy Ayers, Donald Byrd and Grant Green are often credited as forerunners of acid jazz. Acid jazz has also experienced minor influences from soul, house, and disco.\nWhile acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance.\n\nAlbum Title: The Soul of Acid Jazz \nArtist | Group: VA \nGenre: Jazz \nNumber of track(s): 16 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 01h:10m:35s:773ms \nTotal size: 161.512 MB \n\nTrack List:\nThe James Taylor Quartet - Let's Get Together\nThe Brand New Heavies - Don't Let It Go to Your Head\nMilton Wright - Keep It Up\nThe Hip Joints - Rock hopper\nCelestine - Movin' on\nDouble Vision - Conscience\nNight Trains - Smoke's clown\nCorduroy - Chowdown\nMother Earth - The fifth quadrant\nFatima Rainey - Love Is a Wonderful Thing\nRaw Stylus - Use Me (7&quot; Edit)\nRobbie Gordon - Still growing\nThe James Taylor Quartet - Love Ballad\nJessica Lauren - Couldn't Take the Missing You\nAlice Clark - Don't you care?\nAshley And Jackson - Solid Gold (Acid Jazz Mix)\n\nENJOY\nplease seed and leave feedback\nvigoni\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e6b01b4f4d3db0185f9072366a04bf2cf215fd","amp;dn":"VA+-+The+Soul+of+Acid+Jazz+%5BMP3+-+320+kbps%5D+%5Bvigoni%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e6b01b4f4d3db0185f9072366a04bf2cf215fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,230,176,27,79,77,61,176,24,95,144,114,54,106,4,191,44,242,21,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
