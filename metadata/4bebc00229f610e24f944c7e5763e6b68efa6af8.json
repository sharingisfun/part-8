These &quot;skills&quot; are built in to every individual and are fully developed -- and unchangeable -- by adulthood. Everyone has these same capabilities, but to varying degrees. And it is this unique and unalterable combination of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and weaknesses that determines success or failure in any given role.\n\nSmarts contains the groundbreaking Executive Skills Profile: a powerful self-assessment tool that will identify, once and for all, a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innate strengths and weaknesses. The results offer tangible proof of why we gravitate to certain tasks and struggle with others. With this newfound clarity, readers will learn to play to their stronger skills, and avoid wasting time on lesser ones they can never improve upon. Most important, they will discover their own unique potential for excellence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bebc00229f610e24f944c7e5763e6b68efa6af8","amp;dn":"Smarts%3A+Are+We+Hardwired+for+Success%3F+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bebc00229f610e24f944c7e5763e6b68efa6af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,235,192,2,41,246,16,226,79,148,76,126,87,99,230,182,142,250,106,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
