The series draws a new map, revealing a Europe rooted in its soil, its history, its legends and speaking without knowing a common language: that of these remarkable trees that embody the present, both in its past and future.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Masters of Water \r\nThe roots of the plane tree on the Island of Peilz, Switzerland, plunge into the waters of Lake Geneva.\r\n\r\n2)  From Fathers to Sons \r\nIn Germany, a majestic, solitary oak stands regally in the middle of a field. In Italy, a venerable cypress, said to have been planted by Saint Francis of Assisi, now grows in the middle of a cloister, the heart of the Franciscan monastery built around it.\r\n\r\n3)  The Roots of Childhood \r\nThe linden dance tree in Hemmelsberg, Germany, and the so-called Whiteleaved Oak in England, raise extraordinary curiosity and vitality. Both trees, one lost in the countryside and the other in the centre of a village, attract visitors.\r\n\r\n4)  Vanquishing Time \r\nA thousand year-old olive tree in Oletta, Corsica, and a spruce named Old Tjikko in Sweden; both appear to defy time itself. The first still produces olives; the second grows wild and has survived the extreme conditions of northern Scandinavia for more than 9,000 years.\r\n\r\n5)  Nature's Deities \r\nThe two thousand year-old yews in La Haye-de-Routot, France, just like the clootie or wish tree in Herchies, Belgium, are imbued with a spirituality whose origins have been lost in time. These trees have grown up with the beliefs that have become attached to them.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/70/Histoires-d-Arbres-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20.5 (~1432Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 832x468\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (French)\r\n * Run-Time: 51 min\r\n * Number Of Parts: 5\r\n * Part Size: 575 MB (average)\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged French and English\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.cameralucida.fr/catalogue/film/291/histoires-darbres","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c29c9989deb228ea46dd34f7d357ca02a58f6adb","amp;dn":"TV5Monde+Histoires+d+Arbres+3of5+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c29c9989deb228ea46dd34f7d357ca02a58f6adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,156,153,137,222,178,40,234,70,221,52,247,211,87,202,2,165,143,106,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
