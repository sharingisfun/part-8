The good news: here's a bunch of virtual biking videos from all over the world, including some by Tacx and others. Some have music, some don't, some have coaching, some don't, etc. The other good news is I didn't RAR the whole thing, so you can pick and choose. The bad news: I didn't have time to go through and relabel them and identify which are which. These were found on the runervals and spinervals area of the Katzforums, you can google them and get more details if you want. Other than that, for indoor cycling/spinning/biking these are great in combo with headbanger music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f996a7b2f7196be9162c1ccbab3a9e1be12acf","amp;dn":"Virtual+Cycling+Bike+Rides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f996a7b2f7196be9162c1ccbab3a9e1be12acf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,249,150,167,178,247,25,107,233,22,44,28,203,171,58,158,27,225,42,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
