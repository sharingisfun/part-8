This book will provide a timely reference book for researchers and students in the\\u00a0areas of both smart antennas and RFID technologies. It is the first book to combine two of the most important wireless technologies together in one book. The handbook will feature chapters by leading experts in both academia and industry\\u00a0offering an in-depth description of terminologies and concepts related to smart antennas in various RFID systems applications. Some topics are: adaptive beamforming for RFID smart antennas, multiuser interference suppression in RFID tag reading, phased array antennas for RFID applications,\\u00a0smart antennas\\u00a0in wireless systems and market analysis and case studies\\u00a0of RFID smart antennas. This handbook will cover the latest achievements in the designs and applications for smart antennas for RFID as well as the basic concepts, terms, protocols, systems architectures and case studies in smart antennas\\u00a0 for RFID\\u00a0readers and tags.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:091ff973c6768e779c929d73af2923a0fbbcb5a5","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Handbook+of+Smart+Antennas+for+RFID+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"091ff973c6768e779c929d73af2923a0fbbcb5a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,31,249,115,198,118,142,119,156,146,157,115,175,41,35,160,251,188,181,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
