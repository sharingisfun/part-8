In 1962, Trower formed a group that became The Paramounts, later including Westcliff High School pupil Gary Brooker. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects. During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called the Jam (not to be confused with the later group with Paul Weller). Trower then joined Brooker's new band Procol Harum following the success of their debut single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; in 1967, remaining with them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five albums.\n\nBefore launching his own eponymous band, he joined singer Frankie Miller, bass player James Dewar, and former Jethro Tull drummer Clive Bunker to form the short-lived combo Jude. This outfit did not record and soon split up.\n\nTrower retained Dewar as his bassist, who took on lead vocals as well, and recruited drummer Reg Isidore (later replaced by Bill Lordan) to form the Robin Trower Band in 1973.\n\nPerhaps Trower's most famous album is Bridge of Sighs (1974).[citation needed] This album, along with his first and third solo albums, was produced by his former Procol Harum bandmate, organist Matthew Fisher. Despite differences, Trower's early power trio work was noted for Hendrixesque influences.\n\nTrower is an influential guitarist who has inspired other guitar legends such as Robert Fripp, who praised him for his bends and the quality of his sounds, and took lessons from him.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Trower teamed up with former Cream bassist Jack Bruce and his previous drummers Lordan and Isidore, for two albums, BLT (Bruce, Lordan, Trower) and Truce (Trower, Bruce, Isidore). After those albums, he released another album with James Dewar on vocals titled Back It Up in 1983. Robin Trower was dropped from Chrysalis Records afterwards.\n\nIn 1991 Trower was also a part of the Night of the Guitars II European tour organised by Sting and The Police manager Miles Copeland. The tour featured Ronnie Montrose, Saga's Ian Crichton, Dave Sharman, Jan Akkerman and Laurie Wisefield.\n\nThirteen albums later, Trower's album, Living Out of Time (2003), features the return of veteran bandmates Dave Bronze on bass, vocalist Davey Pattison (formerly with Ronnie Montrose's band Gamma) and Pete Thompson on drumsÃ¢â‚¬â€the same line-up as the mid 1980s albums Passion and Take What You Need.\n\nWith the same bandmates Trower gave a concert on his 60th birthday in Bonn, Germany. The concert was recorded by the German television channel WDR. It was then released on DVD and subsequently on CD throughout Europe and later the US under the title Living Out of Time: Live. Trower toured the United States and Canada in the summer and autumn of 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Trower released a third recording with Jack Bruce, Seven Moons, featuring Gary Husband on drums.\n\nA 2008 world tour began in Ft. Pierce, Florida on 16 January 2008. Joining Davey Pattison and Pete Thompson was Glenn Letsch (formerly of Gamma) playing bass. European dates began in April. The show of 29 March 2008 at the Royal Oak Music Theater in Royal Oak, Michigan was released as a double album on V12 Records.\n\nAs his &quot;big hero&quot; he referenced the early James Brown where blues is crossing over into rock and roll.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRock Goes To College (RGTC) was a BBC series that ran between 1978 and 1981 on British television. A variety of up-coming rock oriented bands were showcased live from small venues and broadcast simultaneously on television and radio during a 40-50 minute live performance.\n\nIt was a follow-on to the mid-1960s BBC series Jazz Goes to College","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:504da3d8ad6aa260456efd38d30a87b507d19cf7","amp;dn":"Robin+Trower%2FRock+Goes+To+College+%5B1980%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BLIVE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"504da3d8ad6aa260456efd38d30a87b507d19cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,77,163,216,173,106,162,96,69,110,253,56,211,10,135,181,7,209,156,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
