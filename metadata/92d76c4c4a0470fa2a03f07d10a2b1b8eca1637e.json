Some great songs on it, especially Northern Frontier, Seikan Hokuo &amp; the medley from the finale.

(Of course, we people over here have to import- bloody Robotech corp. trademark stuff...)\n\n\nI guess I'll have to update my &quot;everything Macross frontier torrent&quot; now, don't I?  :p\n\n\n\nNOTE: The album is Nyan TRA, not Nyan Tora- I had already made the 'rent before I noticed that, but just thought you should know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d76c4c4a0470fa2a03f07d10a2b1b8eca1637e","amp;dn":"Macross+Frontier+OST+2-+Nyan+TRA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d76c4c4a0470fa2a03f07d10a2b1b8eca1637e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,215,108,76,74,4,112,250,42,3,240,125,16,162,177,184,236,161,99,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
