Each episode follows the in-depth process of an ambitious design project from the initial intricacies of blue prints to the long and often arduous tasks of turning designs into practical living space. Language barriers and foreign planning laws make themselves known - particularly when one couple paint their house blue when the local council passed a ruling that all houses must be white.\n\n\n1)  Modernist Villa Malaga Spain \nGil Briffa, an architect, and his wife Hilary, from St Albans, Herts, wanted a house they could retire to in southern Spain, but not just any old place would do. High in the Andalucian hills, 30 minutes form Malaga on Spain's Costa de Sol, the Briffa's heart's desire was a ruthlessly modernist construction of glass and light, far removed from the whitewashed fincas (farmhouses) that dot the local countryside.\n\n2)  House from Straw Lot France \nMark and Deborah (Debbie) Sampson and daughter, Tilley, like to practice an ecologically sound way of life. Together, the family's over-riding desire is to make a statement about who they are and how they choose to live their life, and to be accepted for the way they are by the local people.\n\n3)  An Artists Retreat Puglia Italy \nPuglia, in Italy's deep south, where the country's heel rounds to the foot's arch, is a land of shimmering heat, olive groves and artists' dreams. It is also the place where artists, like David Westby and Leone (Leo) Witton, became hard-working artisans to turn a derelict olive farm into a Roman country estate - despite the worst obstructions of Italian bureaucracy and with very little money.\n\n4)  19th Century Manor House Creuse France \nDenise (Deni) Daniel and Doug Ibbs don't hang around. The couple, in their mid-50s and from Dorset, bought a 19th century manor house in Creuse, Limousin - in central France - on a Sunday, having seen it for the first time ever on the previous Tuesday on the Internet and visited it on the Thursday. They don't mind hard work too, which is even better news because the house was a wreck.\n\n5)  Church Conversion Ireland \nA chance encounter, childhood memories and a desire to split their time between Dublin and County Mayo was all the inspiration Andrew and Jackie Lohan required to go about buying and restoring a derelict church. Built in 1835 and abandoned for 101 years, since it was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in 1902, the church was in a dreadful state of disrepair when the Lohans and their two children stumbled across it on a family holiday to the area in the west of Ireland in 1998.\n\n6)  The Tuscan Castle Tuscany Italy \nKevin meets a couple, Janne Hoff-Tilley and Howard Smythe, who bought a ruin and moved to Italy in 1999, hoping to start work building their dream home in Tuscany. Since then they've spent all their time trying to get planning permission, but finally, after four years, they are about to start work. And it's an epic project: they have bought a derelict 1,000-year-old castle in the Tuscan hills. Now, the couple face their biggest battle of all: rebuilding this massive ruin into a comfortable and luxurious five-bedroom home.\n\n7)  300 Year Old Chalet Les Gets France \nNicky and James Dobree were raised in France and in a mountainous area respectively. Nicky was raised in France, James in Beirut - both have fond memories of the mountains as children. So it was natural for them to one day look to buy a place amongst France's tallest peaks, the Alps. The journey moving the family, including their two young sons, Fabian and Felix, from South London to a renovated 300-year-old farmhouse in Les Gets was to have its ups and downs. It was never meant to be a permanent move. The original plan was to develop the top two floors of the chalet so the family could spend the summer there, overseeing the completion of the bottom floors. They would then be able to rent out the whole chalet in the winter months. The family were only planning to use their new home for the summer seasons.\n\n8)  Florida Villa Alicante Spain \nSpain is the first choice of many Britons planning to build a new life abroad, but it is a little more unusual for South Africans to settle on the Iberian Peninsula. Ten years living and working in London may help explain why Derek and Jen Ray chose Orihuela, inland of Alicante on the Costa Blanca, as the place to build a home and raise their three children, Jenna, Eden and Linzi.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/4557/p24p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/4557/p24p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/9249/cij5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/9249/cij5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4660/9pzv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4660/9pzv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/2164/ebsc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/2164/ebsc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/9544/fcfe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/9544/fcfe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/5140/ussf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/5140/ussf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5224/70lw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5224/70lw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3111/iq95.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3111/iq95.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/4467/mte5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/4467/mte5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5e133f37301e126d706e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1970 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 49mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: average 689 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac7b9ff02738be8946c6e14a50475f7d3ff8826","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+Abroad+2of8+House+from+Straw+Lot+France+DVDRip+x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac7b9ff02738be8946c6e14a50475f7d3ff8826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,199,185,255,2,115,139,232,148,108,110,20,165,4,117,247,211,255,136,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
