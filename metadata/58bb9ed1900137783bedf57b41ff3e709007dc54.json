Using translation as his lens, David Bellos shows how much we can learn about ourselves by exploring the ways we use translation, from the historical roots of written language to the stylistic choices of Ingmar Bergman, from the United Nations General Assembly to the significance of James CameronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Avatar. Is That a Fish in Your Ear? ranges across human experience to describe why translation sits deep within us all, and why we need it in so many situations, from the spread of religion to our appreciation of literature; indeed, Bellos claims that all writers are by definition translators. Written with joie de vivre, reveling both in misunderstanding and communication, littered with wonderful asides, it promises any reader new eyes through which to understand the world. In the words of Bellos: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe practice of translation rests on two presuppositions. The first is that we are all different: we speak different tongues, and see the world in ways that are deeply influenced by the particular features of the tongue that we speak. The second is that we are all the sameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that we can share the same broad and narrow kinds of feelings, information, understandings, and so forth. Without both of these suppositions, translation could not exist. Nor could anything we would like to call social life. Translation is another name for the human condition.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58bb9ed1900137783bedf57b41ff3e709007dc54","amp;dn":"Is+That+a+Fish+in+Your+Ear%3F%3A+Translation+and+the+Meaning+of+Ever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58bb9ed1900137783bedf57b41ff3e709007dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,187,158,209,144,1,55,120,59,237,245,123,65,255,62,112,144,7,220,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
