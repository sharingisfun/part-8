The \nprogram is developed by SurfRight. First it detects viruses and other files that \nhave a suspicious behaviour (behaviour analysis) and sends them then to the scan \ncloud via the Internet. The malicious files are detected in the scan cloud where \nthese are removed by Hitman Pro 3. \n\nThe new version of Hitman Pro, version 3, uses NOD32 Antivirus, Avira AntiVir, \nPrevx, G DATA Anti-Virus and a-squared Anti-Malware to detect malicious software. \n\nAs the various virus scanners are not installed on the local computer, but in the \nscan cloud on Internet, there is a very low system load. This technology is called \n&quot;cloud computing&quot; and is possible using behavioural analysis that can differentiate\nlegitimate from malicious software.\n\n\n\nInfo:\n*****\n\nHitman Pro is a second opinion scanner, designed to rescue your computer from \nmalware (viruses, spyware, rootkits, etc.) that have infected your computer \ndespite all the security measures you have taken (such as anti virus software, \nfirewalls, etc.). \n\nHitman Pro 3 is a fast All-in-One tool to locate, identify and remove viruses, \nspyware, trojans, rootkits and other malware. Hitman Pro 3 will quickly show if \nyour PC is infected with malicious software. \n\nJust relying on a single vendor is not sufficient to completely protect you. \nYou do need a second source to make sure you are secure. Hitman Pro is designed \nto work alongside existing security programs without any conflicts.\n\nResearch shows that many computers are infected, even if they have an up-to-date \nsecurity suite installed, and that a combination of different antimalware programs \nwould be required to prevent infection. \n\nHitman Pro 3 uses innovative cloud computing techniques to detect and remove \npotential malware threats with minimal impact on system performance. \n\n\n\nOverview:\n*********\n\nHitman Pro does not need to install any third party sofware. It is a stand alone \nprogram which looks for unknown and suspicious files, giving each of them a score \nusing a patent pending technique. Unknown and suspicious files are automatically \nidentified by online identification servers. This means no software on your system.\n\nHitman Pro does not scan your system alphabetically, it scans disk objects in \nphysical order on your disk. This also significantly lowers the stress on your \nhardware. Furthermore, a lot of analysis tasks are performed concurrently by \ndeploying tasks multi-threaded. And if you own a multi-core processor, this \nsoftware can efficiently use the extra cores in order to increase enumeration \nspeed even more.\n\nHitman Pro doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to scan every file on your system. Why not? \nWe have profiled standard systems so it knows which files are good. Also, Hitman \nactually focuses on finding objects that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t behave like good software. Software \nthat does not follow trustworthy guidelines will automatically receive a higher \nscore than software that is uninstallable by the user, identifyable, digitally \nsigned, unencrypted, uncompressed, visible and accessible. \n\nHitman Pro scans the computer quickly (less than 5 minutes) and does not slow down \nthe computer (except for the few minutes it is scanning). Hitman Pro does not need \nto be installed. It can be run straight from a USB flash drive, a CD/DVD, local or \nnetwork attached hard drive.\n\nA further benefit of this technology is that you need never again download \ndefinitions on a hourly / daily basis as this is all managed in the cloud further \nreducing the impact on your PC.\n\nThe engine also tries to find out where the software came from, how it got on your \nsystem and what other people say about it on the internet. That probably sounds \ncommon sense or seem impossible to some of you but we are certain you will be \nastonished on how well the scoring system works.\n\nTo remove malicious software the developers have also built a special removal \nengine that is capable of removing the toughest threats. A native NT application \nis capable of removing resilient threats before Windows starts. And of course, \nincluding corresponding references like registry keys and shortcuts. All without \nthe need of updates and signatures.\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n**********\n \nHitman Pro 3.5.5 Build 98 (32-bit) (2010-04-27): \n- Added WinHTTP prerequisite check. A message is displayed on computers \n  running Windows 2000 pre-SP3 and Windows XP RTM. \n- Fixed a problem on computers receiving the message: &quot;The procedure entry point \n  EncodePointer could not be located in the dynamic link library kernel32.dll&quot;. \n- Added Czech language.\n- Added Swedish language.\n\n\nHitman Pro 3.5.5 Build 97 (32-bit) (2010-04-24):\n- Added Quick scan which only scans load point locations and in memory objects.\n  You typically use the Quick scan when you just want to check whether malware \n  is active on the computer. You can choose Quick scan from the split button on \n  the Welcome dialog or specify the /quick command line switch. \n- Improved the overall scan performance on systems protected by an active \n  on-access AV scanner.\n- Fixed a memory leak reducing memory consumption by 20-40MB compared to previous \n  versions.\n- Replaced WinInet by WinHTTP network stack for internet communication. \n  This allows more proxy options and also allows Hitman Pro to run under different \n  accounts like SYSTEM. This is particularly useful in corporate situations.\n- Improved the Scan-at-startup by postponing the scan until the computer has \n  started up (hard disk activity is near idle).\n  Postponing the startup scan improves the overall computer startup speed. Hitman \n  Pro monitors the &quot;Avg. Disks Queue Length&quot; Performance Counter to determine \n  whether the computer finished starting applications. Hitman Pro postpones the \n  startup scan up to a maximum of 5 minutes. After that, the scan is started, \n  despite hard disk activity. \n- Changed the Scan-at-startup from default normal scan to Quick Scan.\n- Fixed a problem with the Winsock repair functionality on 64-bit platforms. \n  Thanks Rein.\n- Added Advanced tab under Settings allowing proxy configurations:\n  *Use Internet Explorer settings (default)\n  *Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD)\n  *Proxy Automatic Configuration URL (PAC)\n  *Manual proxy configuration\n  *Proxy authentication\n- Added Compatible Disk Access mode.\n  This mode uses the Windows API for accessing the disk. This makes Hitman Pro \n  compatible with hard disk snapshoting tools like Rollback RX and AyRecovery. \n  Note that this mode reduces the chance of finding complex rootkits. You can \n  change the Disk Access mode on the Advanced tab under Settings. \n- Added License tab under Settings.\n- Added Apply to all to the drop down action menu of a detected item.\n- Added hyperlink to the finish page allowing the scan log to be exported as XML.\n- Added /ews command line switch.\n- Added /noupload command line switch.\n- Added /quick command line switch.\n- Added /debug and /debug:full command line switch. Use this switch to generate \n  a mini dump if the program crashes.\n- Updated internal white lists.\n- Built using Visual Studio 2010.\n- Lots of minor internal changes.\n- Added Arabic and Polish language.\n\n\n\nLanguages:\n- English, Dutch (Nederlands), Deutsch, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais, \n  Italiano, EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol, Eesti, Greek and Macedonian. \n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n- Windows XP, Vista, 2000, 2003, 2008 and Windows 7 (All 32-bit)\n\n\n\nSurfRight Software publisher profile:\nSurfRight is a Dutch group of developers creating security software for the \nWindows platform. Our products are smarter because we combine proven methods \nwith fresh improvements and technological innovations from other markets.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.surfright.nl/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.surfright.nl/en/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at May 30, 2010 - 22.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05bd42fd5a27b42f2701f3082c9d0830a48d511","amp;dn":"Hitman+Pro+v3.5.5+Build+98+%2832-bit%29+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05bd42fd5a27b42f2701f3082c9d0830a48d511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,91,212,47,213,162,123,66,242,112,31,48,130,201,208,131,10,72,213,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
