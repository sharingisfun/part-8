He then contextualizes the posthumanist vision which, drawing upon biomedical, engineering and techno-scientific studies, concludes that human consciousness is shaped by its co-evolution with other life forms, and our human form inescapably influenced by tools and technology. Finally the book explores posthumanismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots in disability studies, animal studies and bioethics to underscore the constructed nature of Ã¢â‚¬ËœnormalcyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in bodies, and the singularity of species and life itself. \n\nAs this book powerfully demonstrates, posthumanism marks a radical reassessment of the human as constituted by symbiosis, assimilation, difference and dependence upon and with other species. Mapping the terrain of these far-reaching debates, Posthumanism will be an invaluable companion to students of cultural studies and modern and contemporary literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e851b8ae332f832dddf852ad3a0cc7406e0ea72d","amp;dn":"Posthumanism-+Pramod+Nayar+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e851b8ae332f832dddf852ad3a0cc7406e0ea72d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,81,184,174,51,47,131,45,221,248,82,173,58,12,199,64,110,14,167,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
