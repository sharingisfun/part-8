There you are, living deep underground, going about your daily life when you think, ;Hang on! Something;s not right here;What about the outdoors?; Well, that's just a myth ; something to frighten children. A threat for those who disobey the Guardian of Destiny. No one questions why things are as they are. No one wonders if there could be something more.-----\n\n\n[b]Earthsearch:[/b] Some years before the story opens, the huge Earth starship Challenger, on a mission to find Earth-like planets for colonization, encountered a meteoroid shower that killed all of the adult crew and seriously damaged the ship. The only human survivors were four babies - two boys, Telson and Darv, and two girls, Sharna and Astra. The four have been raised from childhood by androids and tutored by two disembodied voices called Angel One and Angel Two. Most of the humans believe the voices are real angels, but Darv is more suspicious and believes they are actually computers.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/earthsearch___mindwarp.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/earthsearch___mindwarp.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/earthsearch.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/earthsearch.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n___________________________________\n\nEarthsearch Mindwarp Cast:\nEwen - Leon Parris\nJenine - India Fisher\nCaudo Inman - Colin Baker\nFather Datley - Nicholas Courtney\nCallie Solont - Michele Livingston\n\n\nEarthsearch Mindwarp - 01 of 03\nEarthsearch Mindwarp - 02 of 03\nEarthsearch Mindwarp - 03 of 03\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 45mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n___________________________________\n\nEarthsearch Cast:\nCommander Telson - Sean Arnold\nSharna - Amanda Murray\nDarv - Haydn Wood\nAstra - Kathryn Hurlbutt\nAngel One - Sonia Fraser\nAngel Two - Gordon Reid\n\n\nEarthsearch - S01 - E01 - Planetfall\nEarthsearch - S01 - E02 - First Footprint City\nEarthsearch - S01 - E03 - Sands Of Kyros\nEarthsearch - S01 - E04 - The Solaric Empire\nEarthsearch - S01 - E05 - The Pools Of Time\nEarthsearch - S01 - E06 - Across The Abyss\nEarthsearch - S01 - E07 - New Blood\nEarthsearch - S01 - E08 - Marooned\nEarthsearch - S01 - E09 - Star Cluster\nEarthsearch - S01 - E10 - Earthfall\n\nEarthsearch - S02 - E01 - The Return\nEarthsearch - S02 - E02 - Flood\nEarthsearch - S02 - E03 - Surrender\nEarthsearch - S02 - E04 - Solaria\nEarthsearch - S02 - E05 - Sundeath\nEarthsearch - S02 - E06 - Supermass\nEarthsearch - S02 - E07 - Deathship\nEarthsearch - S02 - E08 - Megalomania\nEarthsearch - S02 - E09 - Earth\nEarthsearch - S02 - E10 - Earthvoice\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ae0042a029811610f09621de44cb331aa6f9db","amp;dn":"James+Follett+-+Earthsearch+-+Audio+SciFi+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ae0042a029811610f09621de44cb331aa6f9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,174,0,66,160,41,129,22,16,240,150,33,222,68,203,51,26,166,249,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
