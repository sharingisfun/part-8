The main character, DCI Tom Mathias, is played by Richard Harrington.[3] On 27 November 2013, a second series was announced by S4C.[4] An English language version, with brief passages of Welsh dialogue, aired on BBC One Wales. When it was aired on the BBC in 2014, it was the first BBC television drama with dialogue in both English and Welsh.[5] A third series of the show began filming in January 2016.[6]\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nThe series reflects the commitment made in April 2013 by the Director of BBC Cymru Wales, Rhodri Talfan Davies, to show more Welsh language life and culture on the mainstream BBC channels.[5]\r\n\r\nOn a tight budgetâ€”which funds that took two and a half years to raise â€”the total production cost was Â£4.2 million.[7] The programme makers received Â£215,000 in repayable business funding from the Welsh Government and was mainly filmed in Aberystwyth and the surrounding Ceredigion region on the west coast of Wales, over a 124 day period in 2013. The show was filmed in both Welsh and English, with the location-based production offices contained within the former Ceredigion Council offices Swyddfa'r Sir, which also acts as the external scene of the show's police station.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh version was broadcast (in eight parts) on S4C in October 2013, with the bilingual version (in four parts) broadcast on BBC One Wales in January 2014 and on BBC Four later that year.[8] The broadcaster which produced The Killing, Danmarks Radio (DR), acquired the rights in 2012 to broadcast the show in Denmark,[9] before filming had commenced.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad8c72af23798a154712f580a2b0e5ea1f5612a","amp;dn":"Hinterland-Y.Gwyll-2015.Special.and.Series.2--BBC-2015-360p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad8c72af23798a154712f580a2b0e5ea1f5612a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,216,199,42,242,55,152,161,84,113,47,88,10,43,14,94,161,245,97,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
