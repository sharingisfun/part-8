The winter 2008-09 assault claimed the lives of 1,400 Palestinians and thrust the crisis in Gaza into the center of the debate about the Israel Palestine conflict.\n\nWith the constant humiliation of living a life punctuated by regular military incursions and ubiquitous checkpoints, Gaza has come to be known as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest open-air prison.\n\n=========\n\nISBN-13: 9781608460977\n\nPDF : 982kb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aaeb2ad159aaf785b962fd2b68b724c4b78eb0e","amp;dn":"Gaza+in+Crisis+-+Noam+Chomsky+%26+Ilan+Pappe+%282010%29+-+PDF+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aaeb2ad159aaf785b962fd2b68b724c4b78eb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,174,178,173,21,154,175,120,91,150,47,210,182,139,114,76,75,120,235,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
