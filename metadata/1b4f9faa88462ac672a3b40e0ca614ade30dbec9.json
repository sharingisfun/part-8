It is a story of manipulation, conflict, intimidation, emotional blackmail and fevered attempts by her children to escape the clutches of their domineering and needy mother.\n\nThe series uses a wealth of written material and photos left by Victoria, Albert and her children, including letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals, to bring the subject and characters to life.\n\nThe Best Laid Plans...\n1/3 An exploration of Queen Victoria's tempestuous relationship with Prince Albert.\n\nA Domestic Tyrant\n2/3 An examination of Queen Victoria's relationship with her daughters.\n\nPrinces Will Be Princes...\n3/3 Examination of how Victoria's sons struggled to live up to Prince Albert's model of purity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4f9faa88462ac672a3b40e0ca614ade30dbec9","amp;dn":"Queen+Victoria%27s+Children+%5B2013%5D+BBC+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4f9faa88462ac672a3b40e0ca614ade30dbec9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,79,159,170,136,70,42,198,114,163,180,14,12,166,20,173,227,13,190,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
