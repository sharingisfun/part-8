The comprehensive coverage, featuring in-depth explanations of recent rapid developments, demonstrates this to be one of the most diverse of modern scientific disciplines.\n\nThe Physics of Living Processes: A Mesoscopic Approach is comprised of five principal sections:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Building Blocks\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Soft Condensed Matter Techniques in Biology\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Experimental Techniques\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Systems Biology\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Spikes, Brains and the Senses\n\nThe unique focus is predominantly on the mesoscale Ã¢â‚¬â€ structures on length scales between those of atoms and the macroscopic behaviour of whole organisms. The connections between molecules and their emergent biological phenomena provide a novel integrated perspective on biological physics, making this an important text across a variety of scientific disciplines including biophysics, physics, physical chemistry, chemical engineering and bioengineering.\n\nAn extensive set of worked tutorial questions are included, which will equip the reader with a range of new physical tools to approach problems in the life sciences from medicine, pharmaceutical science and agriculture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f17412a265577a929188c3a308be27159a0fed","amp;dn":"The+Physics+of+Living+Processes-+Waigh+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f17412a265577a929188c3a308be27159a0fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,241,116,18,162,101,87,122,146,145,136,195,163,8,190,39,21,154,15,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
