Bawdy and moving, the ultimate word-of-mouth bestseller, Rubyfruit Jungle is about growing up a lesbian in America Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and living happily ever after.\n\nBorn a bastard, Molly Bolt is adopted by a dirt-poor Southern couple who want something better for their daughter. Molly plays doctor with the boys, beats up Leroy the tub and loses her virginity to her girlfriend in sixth grade. \n\nAs she grows to realize she's different, Molly decides not to apologize for that. In no time she mesmerizes the head cheerleader of Ft. Lauderdale High and captivates a gorgeous bourbon-guzzling heiress. \n\nBut the world is not tolerant. Booted out of college for moral turpitude, an unrepentant, penniless Molly takes New York by storm, sending not a few female hearts aflutter with her startling beauty, crackling wit and fierce determination to become the greatest filmmaker that ever lived. \n\nCritically acclaimed when first published, Rubyfruit Jungle has only grown in reputation as it has reached new generations of readers who respond to its feisty and inspiring heroine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16bcd4795e89fb4f03f473e45232f7cf3433ccfd","amp;dn":"Rubyfruit+Jungle+by+Rita+Mae+Brown+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16bcd4795e89fb4f03f473e45232f7cf3433ccfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,188,212,121,94,137,251,79,3,244,115,228,82,50,247,207,52,51,204,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
