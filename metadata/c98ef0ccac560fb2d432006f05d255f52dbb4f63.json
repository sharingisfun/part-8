Nothing spectacular here; very generic observational Black comedy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ exactly what you will find from twenty other similar comedians. Still, the odd moment is worth a grin. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth one watch and out, but nothing fall down funny here. He is all hamburger, hope you werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t looking for steak. You see occasional flashes where he dances around being really good, and then he takes the offramp into just what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d expect. All in all, a rather sad commentary on what passes for top notch these days. Is there no creativity left out there?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803878/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803878/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEarthquake (born Nathaniel Martin Stroman on May 29, 1963 in Washington, D.C.) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He performed a half-hour HBO special as part of the series One Night Stand, which first aired on August 26, 2005. He also had a small role in Kevin Smith&amp;#039;s film Clerks II, released in July 2006. He has a recurring role as Chris&amp;#039; Uncle Mike, on Everybody Hates Chris.\n\nMilitary career\nEarthquake was in the U.S Air Force for eleven years. He refused to be a combatant in the Gulf War and was honorably discharged as a conscientious objector. He had attained the rank of Sergeant but was demoted to Airman First Class before his discharge.\n\nEarthquake revealed on The Howard Stern Show that while he was in the U.S. Air Force, he once dropped a live nuclear missile when he was loading it into an aircraft. According to Earthquake, the incident caused much panic and was classified as a Broken Arrow, a situation that alerts a large portion of the military, including the President of the United States. He claimed he was rushing to attend a 2 Live Crew concert.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_%28comedian%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_%28comedian%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial Bio on Comedy Central - http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/e/earthquake.jhtml?display=bio/\n\nOfficial website - http://www.quakeshouse.net/loudbaby/\n\n\nPS - If you love this guy, as so many seem to, then make sure you seed well, because once at least five people have it I&amp;#039;m going to stop seeding and delete it from my system.
