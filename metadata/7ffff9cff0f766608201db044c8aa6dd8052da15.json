The plan was to return eleven years later and read them. But now, as that date arrives, much has changed. Ellie, bereft of the faith she grew up with, is a single mom living in a tired apartment trying to make ends meet. Sometimes she watches television to catch a glimpse of her old friend Ã¢â‚¬â€Nolan, now an NBA star, whose terrible personal tragedies fueled his faith and athletic drive in equal measure. But Nolan also suffers from a transcendent loneliness that nothing has ever eased. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ffff9cff0f766608201db044c8aa6dd8052da15","amp;dn":"The+Chance%3A+A+Novel+by+Karen+Kingsbury+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ffff9cff0f766608201db044c8aa6dd8052da15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,255,249,207,240,247,102,96,130,1,219,4,76,138,166,221,128,82,218,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
