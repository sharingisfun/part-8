The final two sections contain study protocols for presenting chief complaints or suspected diagnoses, normal values, and high-yield tables and lists. Each test includes a photograph of the proper set-up, indications for performing the test, technical pointers, and physiological considerations.\n\nKey Features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Organized consistently and pocket-sized for quick reference in the EMG lab\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes a photo of the proper set-up for each test, indications for performing the test, and clinical pearls and pointers to enhance skills\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Contains study protocols for common complaints, normal value ranges for individual tests, and high-yield tables and lists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e69a3c2e61ca57e0fea230324e04e43bd4f888a","amp;dn":"Pocket+EMG++%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e69a3c2e61ca57e0fea230324e04e43bd4f888a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,105,163,194,230,28,165,126,15,234,35,3,36,224,78,67,189,79,136,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
