This, alongside performances at OsloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prestigious ÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“ya Festival (earning them 8 of 10 points in British Metal Hammer magazine), combined with an appearance on the national TV program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LydverketÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, created a buzz around the band that led to two sold-out nights at OsloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 500-crowd-capacity John Dee club. The band then signed with small indie label Racing Junior, penciling the release of their first EP and album for spring 2005.\n\nAnimal Alpha spent 2005 playing all over Norway supporting their self-titled EP and debut-album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPheromonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which was released on September 5.\n\nTheir Second album, &quot;You Pay for the Whole Seat, But You'll Only Need the Edge&quot; was released on January 28, 2008.\n\nAs of March 12, 2009, Animal Alpha has disbanded. On their website and myspace, a press release was posted, saying that the band &quot;found themselves in a creative deadlock while preparing for their third album and after evaluating the situation decided to call it quits.&quot; At least two of the band members will be pursuing solo careers or other projects. \n\nAgnete has a new band - Djerv. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lastfm.ru/music/Djerv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lastfm.ru/music/Djerv&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bcf143c88f88fef7cba8f5d7b0cbc871848cd6d","amp;dn":"Animal+Alpha+-+Full+Discography+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bcf143c88f88fef7cba8f5d7b0cbc871848cd6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,207,20,60,136,248,143,239,124,186,143,93,123,12,188,135,24,72,205,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
