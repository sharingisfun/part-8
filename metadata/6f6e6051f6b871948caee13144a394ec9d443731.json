Fully updated with the latest research and new learning features, it provides a thought-provoking overview of evolution and illuminates the evolutionary foundation of many of the broader topics taught in psychology departments. The text retains its balanced and critical evaluation of hypotheses and full coverage of the fundamental topics required for undergraduates. This new edition includes more material on the social and reproductive behaviour of non-human primates, morality, cognition, development and culture as well as new photos, illustrations, text boxes and thought questions to support student learning. Some 280 online multiple choice questions complete the student questioning package. This new material complements the classic features of this text, which include suggestions for further reading, chapter summaries, a glossary, and two-colour figures throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6e6051f6b871948caee13144a394ec9d443731","amp;dn":"Evolutionary+Psychology%3A+An+Introduction%2C+3rd+Edition+%5B2014%5D+%5BPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6e6051f6b871948caee13144a394ec9d443731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,110,96,81,246,184,113,148,140,174,225,49,68,163,148,236,157,68,55,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
