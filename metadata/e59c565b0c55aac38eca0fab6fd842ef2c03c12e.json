Whether you're aiming for literary immortality or just an unforgettable one-liner, The Elements of Eloquence proves that you don't need to have anything to say - you simply need to say it well.\n\nAuthor:\n\nMark Forsyth is a blogger and author whose books have made him one of the UK's best-known commentators on words. His book The Etymologicon was a Sunday Times Number One bestseller and was followed by the similarly successful The Horologicon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e59c565b0c55aac38eca0fab6fd842ef2c03c12e","amp;dn":"The+Elements+Of+Eloquence+-+How+To+Turn+The+Perfect+English+Phra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e59c565b0c55aac38eca0fab6fd842ef2c03c12e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,156,86,91,12,85,170,195,142,202,15,171,111,216,66,239,44,3,193,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
