The we became  decorative concrete contractors. We would order products and pay huge shipping fees. That made our profit very small. No-one seemed to sale the products we needed locally. We started going to every school we could find. Johnny became certified in several areas. \nWe then began meeting with experienced chemists and math wizards. We did lots of product research. We then began making my own products. IWe were using our products and perfecting them as we went. We said one day, you should write a book on this. We am not  writers. However we did create some manuals on each of the products that we had made. We opened a retail store and place the products in it. We have sold the finished products across the usa to pleased contractors. We have sold our formulas and guides to many contractors and manufacturers of other products. Some of the address and numbers on our guides have changed but not the information. Many people are constantly looking for a shortcut or something special to make concrete perfect. There are water reducers, stabilizers', plasticizers' and many more products that do things to concrete that really are not needed. Are you familiar with the concrete poured years ago? You can't hardly get it out. Its truly awesome. Now concrete thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poured is falling apart in less than one year. \nWe've gone back and researched it to the point you'll say &quot; I could have done that&quot;. Manuals/Guides in the package consists of; acid stains, neutral base stains, water-base stains, overlay mix, splattered texture mix, color hardeners, color releases, wall mix, surface retarder, countertop mix, countertop pastes, colorants and more. The instructions within the manuals are step by step. The raw products are listed. You also get the number(s) website(s) of the product suppliers for components that cannot be found at local hardware store. In the amateur videos, the decorative concrete products used are made by me. The concrete countertops and vanities shown on concretesurfaces.com are made from our concrete countertop mix design. We have had students come from as far as Vietnam and Argentina for a one one custom countertop class. That's the only type class we offer. We feel the one on one class is a better way. Our students our ready when they leave.  We hope this information helps you better understand exactly what the manufacturing manuals are. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edce4d9d121c4d6bf0f6bf0d991abdce8d65e655","amp;dn":"Decorative+Concrete+Secret+trade+product+info.+Make+your+own+pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edce4d9d121c4d6bf0f6bf0d991abdce8d65e655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,206,77,157,18,28,77,107,240,246,191,13,153,26,189,206,141,101,230,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
