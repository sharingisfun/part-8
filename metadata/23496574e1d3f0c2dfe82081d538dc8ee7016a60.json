Gustave Klimt (1862-1918) lies in hospital, dying. In reveries, he recalls the early 1900s: it's fin de siÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨cle Vienna. At the World Exposition in Paris, Klimt meets Georges MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©liÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s, who does a moving picture for him, and Klimt falls under the spell of a woman who may be Lea de Castro. We see Klimt in his studio; we meet his mother and sister, who suffer from mental illness. We watch Klimt the libertine. On his deathbed and as a younger man, he imagines things as well: encounters with ministers and waiters and with women who are willing participants in his pleasures. Is this the source of art?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23496574e1d3f0c2dfe82081d538dc8ee7016a60","amp;dn":"Klimt+%282006%29DVDRip+Bestdivx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23496574e1d3f0c2dfe82081d538dc8ee7016a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,73,101,116,225,211,240,194,223,232,32,129,213,56,220,142,231,1,106,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
