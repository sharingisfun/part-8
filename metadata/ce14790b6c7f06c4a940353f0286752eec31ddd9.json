A some point between the second and third of the series, I began to visualize four completed novels that might together make a single coherent volume, a mega-novel. Now, thanks to Everyman's Library, this volume exists, titled, as I had long hoped, with the name of the protagonist, an everyman who, like all men, was unique and mortal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n&quot;Taken together, this quartet of novels has given its readers a wonderfully vivid portrait of one Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom . . . The books have also created a Kodachrome-sharp picture of American life . . . from the somnolent 50s . . . into the uncertainties of the 80s.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\n&quot;The being that most illuminates the Rabbit quartet is not finally Harry Angstrom himself but the world through which he moves in his slow downward slide, meticulously recorded by one of the most gifted American realists . . . The Rabbit novels, for all their grittiness, constitute John Updike's surpassingly eloquent valentine to his country.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Joyce Carol Oates, THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW\n - - -\n\nPublisher's Summary:\n\nHarry Angstrom was a star basketball player in high school and that was the best time of his life. Now in his mid-20s, his work is unfulfilling, his marriage is moribund, and he tries to find happiness with another woman.\n\nBut happiness is more elusive than a medal, and Harry must continue to run - from his wife, his life, and from himself, until he reaches the end of the road and has to turn back....\n- - -\n\nAuthor Spotlight:\n\nJohn Updike was born in 1932, in Shillington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and spent a year in Oxford, England, at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. From 1955 to 1957 he was a member of the staff of The New Yorker. He wrote more than fifty books, including collections of short stories, poems, essays, and criticism. His novels have won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, the American Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Rosenthal Award, and the Howells Medal. He died in January 2009.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce14790b6c7f06c4a940353f0286752eec31ddd9","amp;dn":"RABBIT+RUN+-+John+Updike.+Read+by+Arthur+Morey+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce14790b6c7f06c4a940353f0286752eec31ddd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,20,121,11,108,127,6,196,169,64,53,63,2,134,117,46,236,49,221,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
