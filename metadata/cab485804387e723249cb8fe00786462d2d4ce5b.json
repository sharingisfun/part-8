Les also had eleven purely instrumental hits in that same period, many of them flipsides of a vocal selection involving Mary. In this collection you get 16 with Mary singing, three charted instrumentals by Les, plus his first solo record ever, the instrumental Lover, a # 21 in March 1948 on Capitol 15037 and its B-side, Brazil, # 22 in which Les plays 6 guitars overdubbed. The liner notes - a selection-by-selection commentary by Les - includes a fascinating tale behind the making of Lover which is not to be missed.\n\nFor the most part throughout their collaboration (they divorced in 1963) the Mary Ford sides, with her silky-smooth, jazz-tinged voice, consistently outdid the purely instrumental sides - with three exceptions: Josephine, at # 12, finished six positions higher than I Wish I Had Never Seen Sunshine in August 1951 on Capitol 1592; Meet Mr. Callaghan, a # 5 in Sept-Oct 1952 on Capitol 2193 outpaced Take Me In Your Arms And Hold Me (# 15); and Moritat (Theme From A Three Penny Opera), a # 49 in Feb-March 1956 did much better than Nuevo Laredo (# 91). Of the sides just mentioned only Meet Mr. Callaghan is included here.\n\nEverywhere else it was Mary's voice that made the hit, and whether or not that sat well with Les is known only to his close friends and acquaintances. But I have always wondered at the photo on the front of this disc, and the caption. Although it's clearly the same photograph as the one on the cover of &quot;Les Paul And Mary Ford All-Time Greatest Hits&quot;, in this later release to celebr ate his 90th birthday, not only has Mary been cropped, she gets almost second billing: Les PAUL with Mary Ford. Curious.\n\nPaul, who never cut a R&amp;R record in his life, was inducted into the R&amp;R Hall Of Fame in 1988 in the &quot;early influence&quot; category - ostensibly because of his developments with the electric guitar.\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nLes Paul &amp; Mary Ford - The Best of the Capitol Masters: Selections From &quot;The Legend and the Legacy&quot; Box Set\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford\nAlbum................: The Best of the Capitol Masters: Selections From &quot;The Legend and the Legacy&quot; Box Set\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1992 07 20\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 29 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
