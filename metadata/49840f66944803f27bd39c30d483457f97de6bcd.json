The documentary film Jandek on Corwood definitively explores the most intriguing mystery in modern music. Featuring revealing interviews, evocative imagery and one of the most bizzare and compelling soundtracks in film history, Jandek on Corwood will challenge the viewer&amp;#039;s conception of music, art, and the nature of celebrity.\n\n\n***\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nJandek is the musical project of an outsider musician who operates out of Houston, Texas. Since 1978, Jandek has self-released 51 albums of unusual, often emotionally dissolute folk and blues songs without ever granting more than the occasional interview or providing any biographical information. Jandek often plays a highly idiosyncratic and frequently atonal form of folk and blues music, often using an open and unconventional chord structure. Jandek&amp;#039;s music is unique, but his lyrics closely mirror the country blues and folk traditions of Eastern Texas.\n\n***\n\nJandek Albums Available From:\n\nCorwood Industries\nP.O.
