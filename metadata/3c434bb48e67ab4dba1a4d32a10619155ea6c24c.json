And, maybe more important, why. O'Brien is excellent as the corpse-to-be. So are Beverly Garland (billed here as Beverly Campbell) and Neville Brand. Dmitri This terrifically taut landmark film never lets up for a minute. A great script and beautiful score by legendary composer Dimitri Tiompkin makes this one of the finest noir films ever made. Beautifully restored from the producer's negative. Ernst Laszlo's moody camerawork help set the picture's cynical, sinister tone. Location shooting on the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco add immeasurably to the overall effect.\n\nDirector Rudolph Mate was known as a top cinematographer (The Pride of the Yankees and Foreign Correspondent, among others) before turning to directing. And it certainly shows in D.O.A. 's striking visuals.\n\nIn lesser hands, D.O.A.'s plot could have made for a gimmicky, ridiculous film. This point was proven by the picture's two remakes, 1968's Color Me Dead (great title, though) and D.O.A. (1988). But the original, restored here from 35mm, still stands as quintessential film noir. \nActors:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Edmond O'Brien\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pamela Britton\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lynn Baggett\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Beverly Garland\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Neville Brand\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Luther Adler\n\nWriters:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Russell Rouse\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Clarence Green\n\nProducers:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Leo C.
