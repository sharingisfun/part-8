The story revolves around Blake Washburn, a mildly leftist newspaperman, played by Jeffrey Lynn. Returning to his home town, Washburn turns his journalistic vitriol upon the local business interests. Only after his kid sister Katie (Melinda Plowman), trapped in a cave-in, is rescued by locally produced technology, does Washburn realize the value of the capitalistic system. Home Town Story was fitfully distributed by MGM, then lapsed into obscurity. It might have remained there had it not been for the presence of a young Marilyn Monroe in a supporting part.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043651/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043651/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nArthur Pierson\n\n\tJeffrey Lynn\t ... \tBlake Washburn\n\tDonald Crisp\t... \tJohn MacFarland\n\tMarjorie Reynolds\t... \tJanice Hunt\n\tAlan Hale Jr.\t... \tSlim Haskins\n\n\tMarilyn Monroe\t... \tIris Martin\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:01:08\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1509 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 91 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b803ca370cb4f4a3399fa5e63efad3a71f05d2","amp;dn":"Home+Town+Story+%281951%29+Marilyn+Monroe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b803ca370cb4f4a3399fa5e63efad3a71f05d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,184,3,202,55,12,180,244,163,57,159,165,230,62,250,211,167,31,5,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
