It was the second and last song from the group not to \ncontain lyrics, following &quot;Intermezzo No.1&quot; the previous year.\n\nAs with &quot;Intermezzo No.1&quot;, the choral tune, heavily influenced by traditional \nSwedish folk music, was written by Benny Andersson and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Ulvaeus. It was \nrecorded on 30 August 1976 at Stockholm's Metronome Studio.\n\nIn 1983, a different version of the song with lyrics, called &quot;Belle&quot;, was sung \nby Daniel Balavoine and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (&quot;Frida&quot;) as part of the French \nmusical ABBAcadabra. Also in 1983, it was re-recorded with different lyrics, and \nreleased as &quot;Time&quot; by B. A. Robertson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad.\n\nThe title of the album, Arrival, gave the instrumental its name, rather than \nvice versa. It was also one of the last tracks to be recorded for the album \nbefore its release on 11 October 1976.\n\nin 1980 Mike Oldfield made a cover-version of the song, which is found on his \nQE2 album. The artwork for Oldfield's single is a parody of ABBA's Arrival album \nartwork depicting the artist in a Bell 47G helicopter.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWILLIAM TELL OVERTURE\n\n&quot;William Tell Overture&quot; is a single by musician Mike Oldfield, released in 1977. \nIt is a rendition of the William Tell Overture. However this version of the \nWilliam Tell Overture did not have much of an impact on the UK charts.[1] It is \nthe first of the two non-album singles released by Mike Oldfield in 1977.\n\nThe UK B side was &quot;Argiers&quot;, which had previously been the European b-side for \nan earlier Oldfield single &quot;Portsmouth&quot;. &quot;Argiers&quot; had been recorded in January \n1976 at Througham and features Leslie Penning on recorders. Some European \nversions included the track &quot;First Excursion&quot; as the b-side, however in Brazil \nthe b-side was &quot;Portsmouth&quot;.[2] The B-sides were taken from Oldfield's \nCollaborative / Remix Box-set, Boxed.\n\nThe music video for The William Tell Overture is comprised of multiple \nincarnations of Oldfield performing the song on different instruments. The \neffect is as if a room full of Oldfields were playing together.\n\n    * When referring to his then most recent release, The William Tell Overture, \nOldfield called &quot;It a real rouser&quot;.\n    * In an advert for the single, the tagline &quot;It'll shake you to the core&quot; was \nused, referring to William Tell's apple incident.\n    o The full advert reads: &quot;The new single from the more whimsical side of \nMike Oldfield. You clog-danced to 'In Dulci Jubilo'. You crashed through the \nceiling to 'Portsmouth'. Now hear William Tell Overture by Mike Oldfield. It'll \nshake you to the core.&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCUCKOO SONG\n\nIt was originally written by Michael Praetorius (1571 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1621) and was arranged \nby Oldfield. The B side (Pipe Tune) is an original composition by Oldfield. The \nsingle (in a plain white sleeve) was included as a free bonus when the double LP \nIncantations was released in 1978. It is one of the many non-album singles which \nOldfield released in the 1970s. &quot;Cuckoo Song&quot; also features Les Penning.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIN DULCI JUBILO\n\nMike Oldfield's &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot; is an instrumental version of the traditional \nChristmas carol &quot;Good Christian Men Rejoice&quot;. The carol is traditionally sung to \na German tune of the same name as Oldfield's tune. Mike Oldfield had recorded \nanother version of this song as the B-side to his previous single, &quot;Don \nAlfonso&quot;, which did not chart, playing all instruments himself. Later, he felt a \nbetter version could be done, and re-recorded it in October 1975 at the Manor, \nbut incorporating some of the previous version's backing tracks recorded \nNovember 1974 at the Beacon, his home studio.\n\nThe new version features Leslie Penning on 2 recorders (probably treble and \nsopranino) and kortholt, Mike Oldfield on acoustic and electric guitars, piano \nand ARP string synthesiser, and William Murray on snare drum.[1] Oldfield's \ndecision to re-record the song proved to be a good move; it appeared in \nChristmas season playlists on radio across Europe, charting at number 4 in the \nUK,[2] and is one of his most re-issued short songs. It also charted at number 7 \nin the Irish Singles Chart and at number two on the Dutch Top 40.\n\nThe song's authorship shown in the track listing below is how it appears on a \nrecent compilation CD. Most editions from the 1970s and 1980s credit it to R. L. \nPearsall, arr. Oldfield. Bach and Pearsall both wrote arrangements of it, but \nthe song dates further back than either composer. Italian pressings of the \nsingle from 1975 credit it to J. S. Bach.\n\n&quot;On Horseback&quot; features Mike Oldfield on vocals, accompanied by a children's \nchorus credited as the Penrhos kids. It previously appeared as an untitled song \nat the end of Oldfield's 1975 album Ommadawn, banded separately but merely \nlisted as part of &quot;Ommadawn part two&quot; on the label. The album's liner notes \nrefer to it as &quot;the horse song on side two&quot;. Virgin Records recognised this song \ncould also be a contender as a Christmas hit, and was already being played on \nradio before it was issued as a single; therefore the UK single's label bore a \nlarge &quot;A&quot; on each side to encourage radio play of both sides. A large &quot;A&quot; is \noften used to mark promo records, and copies are often mis-identified as promos, \nbut all have this mark.\n\nThis record's success as a Christmas single encouraged Oldfield to issue a \nsimilar instrumental piece, usually with recorder as the lead instrument, as a \nsingle every year's Christmas season up to 1980.\n\nA music video was made for this song, and can be found on the DVD, Elements - \nThe Best of Mike Oldfield. It is probably the only non-recent Mike Oldfield \nvideo that is still shown occasionally on television. The video splits the \nscreen in up to 9 thumbnail frames, each showing Mike miming playing a different \ninstrument. Mike's face is not shown in frames where he is seen playing an \ninstrument he did not play on the record.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPORTSMOUTH\n\nIn an attempt to repeat the success of his previous year's Christmas hit, &quot;In \nDulci Jubilo&quot;, Mike recorded another traditional folk melody dating from 1701 \n(first known publication),[1][2] again using Leslie Penning on recorders. The \nsingle was just as successful as its predecessor, charting at number 3 in the \nUK,[3] and became his first non-album single to be issued in the USA. It also \ncharted at number 19 in Ireland. Mike Oldfield plays acoustic guitar, accordion, \nmandolin, ARP string synthesiser, tambourine, kettle drum and bodhran (Irish \ndrum), and both Oldfield and Penning are credited with &quot;feet&quot;.[4]\n\nThis song, plus two others chosen as the B-side in different countries, had been \nreleased the month before as three of four new songs on the compilation album \nBoxed. They were mixed and encoded for SQ quadraphonic sound, the only format \nthis album was issued in, and all issues of these songs in vinyl and tape \nformats have the encoding, even if they only say &quot;stereo&quot; on the label, as do \nall single releases.\n\n&quot;Argiers&quot; is another traditional folk song, performed by Leslie Penning on \nrecorders and Mike Oldfield on acoustic guitar and ARP string synthesiser. An \nunusual feature of this arrangement is that it is in a minor key, having been \nconverted from its original major key via diatonic transposition. &quot;Portsmouth&quot; \nand &quot;Argiers&quot; were both recorded in January 1976 at Througham, Mike's new home \nstudio, shortly after he moved from his previous home in Hergest Ridge, which \nwas the location of his previous home studio, the Beacon.[4]\n\n&quot;Speak (Tho' You Only Say Farewell)&quot; is an old show tune performed by David \nBedford on piano and vocals, and Mike Oldfield on vocals. It is similar in style \nto Bedford's earlier work in the Coxhill-Bedford Duo with Lol Coxhill, and was \nrecorded at the Beacon in November 1974.\n\nA music video was made for this song, and can be found on the DVD, Elements - \nThe Best of Mike Oldfield. Shot in Mike's Througham studio, it shows four female \nfolk dancers who dance around the studio, while Mike is seen playing various \ninstruments, but not the recorder, which he did not play on the record. As in \nthe video for Mike's previous single, &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;, the video emphasizes \nthat Mike plays all the instruments, even though this is not strictly true.\n\nThe song has become synonymous with English football club, Portsmouth F.C., who \nsometimes play the tune before or after games at their home stadium, Fratton \nPark. Notably it was played during their victorious FA Cup 2008 campaign, \nincluding after the final game against Cardiff City on 17 May 2008 at Wembley.\n\nThe piece was also featured in the 1979 NASA documentary film by Tony Palmer, \nThe Space Movie.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGUILTY\n\nWhen Oldfield was in New York recording Platinum and &quot;Guilty&quot; he recorded a \ndisco arrangement of his first album, Tubular Bells.[1] A version of Free's &quot;All \nRight Now&quot; was also recorded during these sessions.\n\nIt is notable for being Oldfield's first obvious attempt to capitalise on a \ncurrent musical trend, in this case disco/dance music.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Guilty&quot; is in a colourful cartoon style.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBLUE PETER\n\nThe royalties from the single went to the Cambodia appeal launched by the \nchildren's show.[1] It charted at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nTraditionally, the debut of a new version of the famous theme tune &quot;Barnacle \nBill&quot; is accompanied with an introduction by the presenters at the time \nexplaining the reasons behind the new rendition. Mike Oldfield's version had its \ngenesis in his appearance on the programme in 1979 to demonstrate how modern pop \nmusic was created using multi-track recording techniques. The end result was \nliked enough by both the viewers and programme producers to be retained as the \npermanent theme, and Oldfield additionally recorded a new version of the \nprogramme's closing music, which runs for just 20 seconds and has never been \ncommercially released.\n\nIt should be noted that the released version of the theme is actually a further \nre-recording, which incorporates many subtle changes compared to the TV version, \nin addition to eliminating the opening snare drum roll, extending the piece to a \nmore suitable duration for commercial release, and being mixed in stereo. The TV \nversion was mono-only (British television was not broadcasting in stereo at that \ntime) and has never been made available for sale.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Blue Peter&quot; shows Oldfield competing in a race with various \nkinds of vehicles. The intro is filmed in black and white and begins with a \nsilent movie style title card 'Episode 4 &quot;The Race&quot;'; there is a second card \nafter a short sequence with Oldfield and another man, displaying 'Zhree, Two, \nvun Actshun!' (meaning 'Three, Two, One, Action!'). The race then begins, three \nof the competitors are Oldfield himself (filmed in different shots as a pilot, \npirate and a man with a moustache) and some are not. The vehicles include \nhovercraft, a tricycle hang glider, a helicopter, a three wheeled ATV, a larger \nATV and a kite buggy. The end of the video appears to parody the His Master's \nVoice logo with a gramophone and a dog (ie. Nipper).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWONDERFUL LAND\n\n&quot;Wonderful Land&quot; is UK #1 single by The Shadows. The song was released on the \nAtlantic Records label in the U.S., but did not reach the Billboard Top 100. \nThis single stayed more weeks at #1 in the UK than any other single during the \n60's - including those by The Beatles.\n\nMike Oldfield covered &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; on his 1980 QE2 album. Oldfield's version \nwas also released as a single and as the B-side for his &quot;Sheba&quot; single; in some \ncountries, &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; was the a-side. The Shadows later covered one of \nOldfield's songs, &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;.\n\nTwo guitarists, Hank Marvin (of The Shadows) and Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits) \nrecorded a version of &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; in the 1990s, produced by Jeff Lynne.\n\nAsk any British guitarist of a certain age who his most profound early influence \nwas, and chances are that he will answer the Shadows. Between 1960-1963, Cliff \nRichard's sometime backing band dominated the U.K. chart with a succession of \ndynamic guitar-led instrumentals, of which the magnificent &quot;Wonderful Land&quot; was \nonly one of the most memorable.\n\nMike Oldfield's rendition owes everything and nothing to that prototype. A duet \nbetween effects-laden guitars, African percussion, and haunting electronics, it \ncaptures every last nuance of the majesty that pervaded the Shadows' original -- \nbut, in slowing the melody down to a fraction of its familiar pace, it imbibes \nthe piece with a haunting, anthemic quality that is almost painfully nostalgic. \nCertainly it remains one of the most successful of all Shadows covers, all the \nmore so since Oldfield's affection for the piece is palpably balanced by the \nalmost parodic impact of the percussion. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nETUDE (THEME FROM THE KILLING FIELDS)\n\nIt is from the album The Killing Fields, the soundtrack album for the film of \nthe same name . It was reissued in 1990, when it was used in a commercial for \nNurofen. The 1990 release also featured a track called &quot;Gakkaen&quot; by The Ono \nGagaku Kai Society.\n\n&quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tude&quot; is taken from the Francisco TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rrega piece &quot;Recuerdos de la Alhambra&quot;.\n\nThe music video for &quot;ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°tude&quot; which appears on the Elements - The Best of Mike \nOldfield video shows a boy watching parts of The Killing Fields on a television \nfrom a reel-to-reel tape machine and looking through photographs. The boy also \nplays with a Fairlight CMI, which the soundtrack album was composed on.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMOONLIGHT SHADOW\n\n&quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; is a pop song written by British multi-instrumentalist Mike \nOldfield and released as a single in May 1983 and included on the album Crises \nin the same year. The vocals were performed by the Scottish vocalist Maggie \nReilly, who had joined Mike Oldfield in 1980. It has been his most successful \nsingle to date, with Tubular Bells being his most successful album worldwide. It \nis said that the lyrics were a reference to the death of John Lennon.[1]\n\nThe single peaked at number 4 in the British charts, making it Oldfield's second \nhighest ranked single after &quot;Portsmouth&quot; which reached number 3 in 1976. \n&quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; was successful throughout Europe, It reached number 1 in \ncountries including Italy, Austria, Switzerland for four weeks and Norway for \nsix weeks. It spent four weeks at number 2 in Germany and also hit number 6 in \nAustralia. It was re-released as a maxi-CD single in 1993 to promote Oldfield's \nElements box set, charting at number 52.\n\nA 12&quot; single (later reissued on a 3&quot; CD single) featured an extended version of \nthe song with an extra verse and the single B-side was &quot;Rite of Man&quot; which was a \nrare instance of Oldfield singing lead vocal. The extended mix also appears on \nhis compilation album The Platinum Collection.\n\nIn 1991 the song was re-released in France and in 1993, it was featured on \npromos for Elements in France and Spain.\n\nMaggie Reilly sang &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; live when she toured with Oldfield in the \n1980s. However since then, other singers have performed the song live with \nOldfield including, Anita Hegerland, Miriam Stockley and Rosa CedrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n.\n\nThe original cover art is an enlargement of the lower right corner of the Crises \nalbum cover. This shows a man with his foot on a ledge with the sea and sky in \nthe background. The moon, the tower and its shadow from the album cover cannot \nbe seen on the single cover.\n\nAn early version of the song was entitled &quot;Midnight Passion&quot; with vocals by \nBritish singer Hazel O'Connor.[2] Along with Maggie Reilly, a girlfriend of one \nof the roadies when Oldfield was on tour, Oldfield used a rhyming dictionary and \nrecorded many of the lyrics word by word.[3] According to Oldfield, Virgin \nRecords were immediately happy with the song and wanted more pieces similar to \nit.\n\nOldfield later sampled the drums from &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; for the song &quot;Man in \nthe Rain&quot; on his 1998 album, Tubular Bells III.\n\nIt was long believed that the lyrics are a reference to the murder of John \nLennon, although when asked about this in a 1995 interview, Oldfield responded:\n\n    [It's] not really [about Lennon]... well, perhaps, when I look back on it, \nmaybe it was. I actually arrived in New York that awful evening when he was shot \nand I was staying at the Virgin Records house in Perry Street, which was just a \nfew blocks down the road from the Dakota Building where it happened, so it \nprobably sank into my subconscious. It was originally inspired by a film I loved \n- Houdini, starring Tony Curtis, which was about attempts to contact Houdini \nafter he'd died, through spiritualism... it was originally a song influenced by \nthat, but a lot of other things must have crept in there without me realising \nit.\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mike Oldfield, Gareth Randall Interviews Mike Oldfield\n\nThe Lennon story may have arisen as a consequence of the content of the promo \nvideo that accompanied the song, which juxtaposes footage of Oldfield and his \nband playing the song with a loose storyline in which Oldfield plays a man who \ngets killed in a pistol duel. It is worth noting that there are two versions of \nthe video, the full-length original, and a shorter one which omits a verse (the \nreason for the shorter version being created is unknown), and the way both \nversions are edited suggests that Oldfield's touring guitarist &quot;Ant&quot; performed \nthe second, overdriven half of the guitar solo, which is not the case.\n\nMike Oldfield's biggest U.K. hit since &quot;Portsmouth&quot; in 1976, &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; \nwas also the best track on 1983's Crises album, a set that saw a wholesale \nrevision of the Mike Oldfield Band, leave vocalist Maggie Riley, alone from the \noutfit that had pushed its leader to such dynamic recent heights.\n\nBest appreciated in the company of its haunting highwayman video, &quot;Moonlight \nShadow&quot; is a dramatic epic of love and death, driven by an Oldfield acoustic \nguitar that echoes in delivery the faintly folky feel of the lyric. Widely \nregarded to be a tribute to the recently murdered John Lennon, &quot;Moonlight \nShadow&quot; was described by Oldfield himself as having been inspired by the Tony \nCurtis movie Houdini. Either way, it's a truly delightful pop song, bolstered by \none of Reilly's most magical vocal performances.\n\nA decade after the fact, Oldfield admitted, &quot;I was at somebody's birthday party \njust after &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; had been a big bit, and of course they all thought \n'wow, big hit, got to do them all exactly like that, then,' which was a \nblinkered mentality, and unluckily I followed that advice and wrote a lot of \nsongs, most of which weren't very good.&quot;\n\n&quot;Crime of Passion&quot; certainly falls into at least the first half of that equation \n-- it is very similar to its storied predecessor although, mercifully, it isn't \nas bad as some of its peers. Despite echoing &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot; all the way down \nto the chorus' repetition of its similarly syllabled title, and a defiant xerox \nof a guitar solo, &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; is nevertheless a memorable number, offered \nfurther notability via the deployment of ex- Family vocalist Roger Chapman on \nthe lead vocal. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFAMILY MAN\n\nAccording to an interview in 1998, Oldfield wrote all of the music for the \nchorus, and verses were written by the other writers. Tim Cross has also claimed \nto have written the majority of the lyrics for the song, and cited Rick Fenn as \nthe inspiration of the 'family man' mentioned in the song.\n\nThe American duo Hall &amp; Oates covered Oldfield's song and it reached #6 on the \nUS Hot 100 in June 1983.\n\nOf all the people to have composed a monster hit single for Hall &amp; Oates, Mike \nOldfield is surely the most unlikely. But &quot;Family Man,&quot; a number six hit for the \nduo in 1982, wasn't simply an ideal number for them; it also ranks among the \nmost archetypal songs of the age, a sharp lyric married to a compulsive rhythm \nand littered with the kind of sonic hooks around which the entire early decade \nwas constructed. Composed by the entire Mike Oldfield Band -- that is, Oldfield, \nvocalist Maggie Riley, keyboard player Tim Cross, guitarist Rick Fenn, and \ndrummer Morris Pert -- the original version of &quot;Family Man&quot; is considerably more \naggressive in its composers' hands than the horribly emasculated take that the \nAmericans created. A pulsating rhythm is characterized by one of Oldfield's most \nviolent guitar solos, while Riley spits out the lyrics as if they were sour \nautobiography. Nevertheless, as a commercial vindication of Oldfield's new \ndirection, there could be no stronger indicator that he was on the correct \ntrack. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMISTAKE\n\nIt was not included on any Oldfield album in Europe until the compilation The \nComplete Mike Oldfield in 1985; however, it was included as an extra track on \nthe North American release of the album Crises in 1983. Maggie Reilly performs \nvocals on &quot;Mistake&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFIVE MILES OUT\n\nThe song (and the music video) make numerous references to flight. The video \nwhich predominantly features the sky, a plane, a pilot, a woman in white and \nOldfield wearing a headset is available on the Elements - The Best of Mike \nOldfield video.\n\n&quot;Five Miles Out&quot; is a song that has a complex structure despite its unusual \nlength. Lyrics are written about Oldfield's experience of a near-tragic flight. \nReilly sings with clean voice while Oldfield uses vocoder most of time himself. \nThe song features same guitar riff that appears in the beginning of &quot;Taurus II&quot; \nand during the intro a keyboard quotes the opening motif to Tubular Bells a \ntrick he repeats in later pieces such as &quot;Crises&quot;.\n\nAfter Mike Oldfield had just finished forming a new band in 1982 with Maggie \nReilly as vocalist, Morris Pert playing percussion, Tim Cross behind the \nkeyboards, and Pierre Moerlen on drums, he released Five Miles Out, his seventh \nrelease since the monumental Tubular Bells album. One of the tracks, &quot;Family \nMan,&quot; was reworked into a pop song by Hall &amp; Oates a year later, and they took \nit all the way to number six on the Billboard charts. But it's the title track \nthat seems to jut out from the rest of the album, sparked by Oldfield's \nexperiences as a bush pilot, and, in this particular case, an incident which \ntossed his airplane around during a heavy thunderstorm while he was flying over \nthe Pyrenees in Spain.\n\nIt's clear that Oldfield has implemented more of a mainstream approach into the \nalbum, but he still manages to include a vast array of instruments in keeping \nwith his reputation as an extremely creative musician. Opening with vocals that \nseem like they're coming through a pilot's headset, it doesn't take long before \nReilly unleashes her gorgeous voice throughout the chorus, which actually gives \nthe impression that it's emanating from above the clouds. While the back rhythm \nand drum parts are neat and tidy, the song is spontaneously injected with the \nhauntingly beautiful sound of the uilleann pipes, which sound a little more \ndynamic than bagpipes, and by Oldfield's tastefully wailing guitar segments. \nBasked with Oldfield's eccentric rhythmic swivelling and effective bits of \nsynthesized gadgetry, &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; does succeed in depicting its intended \nimagery without going overboard. Outside of his soundtrack work, many of \nOldfield's albums include more pop-oriented tracks throughout the rest of the \ndecade, but as &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; proves, he was careful never to stray too far \nfrom his unconventional roots.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCRIME OF PASSION\n\n&quot;Crime of Passion&quot; is a single by musician Mike Oldfield, released in 1984 (see \n1984 in music). The song features Barry Palmer performing vocals.\n\nThe front cover features a black and white photograph of Mike Oldfield's mother \nMaureen, who died in January 1974, ten years before the release of this single.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; takes place in a surrealistic children's \nplay room featuring books, giant blocks (with letters on them), a girl on a \nswing, a military drummer and a clown. In the video Oldfield performs in a \n'mechanical' fashion with Ovation and Fender Stratocaster guitars, while Palmer \nsits on a box and sings. The video is available on the Elements - The Best of \nMike Oldfield video.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO FRANCE\n\nDespite its number 15 placing on the U.K. charts, 1984's Discovery was passed \nover for the most part. The album saw Mike Oldfield continuing with his string \nof more commercially sounding albums, paying more attention to his guitar \nplaying and a little less to his instrumental eccentricities. One of the album's \ntracks entitled &quot;To France&quot; made it to number 48 on the British singles chart, \nwhich may not sound impressive for a pop artist but was quite satisfactory when \nit came to Mike Oldfield's repertoire. Because the song is about Mary Queen of \nScots' exodus to France in the mid-1500s, most of the song's attention was \ngarnered in Europe, and once again it was Maggie Reilly's shimmering voice that \nstole the show. &quot;To France&quot;'s sparkling chorus and pristine keyboard parts fall \njust outside the song's moderate gallop, with Reilly and the accompanying \ninstruments adding some mild Celtic overtones to its melody. A master at the art \nof imagery and ambience, Oldfield manages to convey Mary's desperation and haste \nthrough the sprinkled string work and through the tune's wistful, almost \nsecretive feel. There isn't an overdose of synthesizer or other effectual add-\nons, which in turn makes the song sound pure and quite sincere. All of the \ninstruments are played by Oldfield, and Discovery marked the first time he \nrecorded an album outside of England, opting for a mountainside studio near Lake \nGeneva in Switzerland. While most of the other tracks are typical Oldfield fair, \n&quot;To France&quot; wonderfully stands out as the album's most alluring cut, due in part \nto the &quot;less is more&quot; approach to music making, which is rare for Oldfield. \n\nThe music video that appears on the Elements - The Best of Mike Oldfield video \nfor &quot;To France&quot; is a mock-live performance of the song. Oldfield plays a Fender \nStratocaster in the video.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSHADOW ON THE WALL\n\nIt is from the album Crises. Roger Chapman performs vocals on &quot;Shadow on the \nWall&quot;.\n\nThe b-side is &quot;Taurus 3&quot;, a short, fast paced guitar piece, which is notably \ndifferent from Oldfield's long multi-themed pieces, &quot;Taurus&quot; and &quot;Taurus 2&quot;, on \nQE2 and Five Miles Out respectively.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Shadow on the Wall&quot; is based around an interrogation scene.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLATINUM\n\nMike Oldfield's fifth album was the first to positively state that his future no \nlonger revolved around LP-length rock symphonies. Platinum itself occupied just \none side of the album -- the remainder of the set was given over to the shorter, \nseparate pieces that presaged the albums that would follow.\n\nThe full &quot;Platinum&quot; suite was first conceived as the soundtrack to a 1977 Arts \nCouncil movie entitled Reflections*; since that time, the piece had expanded \ninto a seamless blending of four movements, opening with the strident, guitar-\nled assertion of &quot;Airborne.&quot; &quot;Platinum&quot; itself followed, a slice of neo- disco \ntomfoolery that rode hefty drums and a teasing guitar towards a gruff cry of \n&quot;take it away!&quot; that led, in turn, into one of the most compulsively rocking \npieces of music in Oldfield's entire canon. The third movement, the aptly-titled \n&quot;Charleston,&quot; follows the floor-filling disco rhythms, overlaid first with \nharshly honking brass, later with a chorus of ghostly cries and wails, before \nthe concluding &quot;North Star/Platinum Finale&quot; unleashes all of the musical magic \nfor which Oldfield is best renowned, an uplifting guitar line soaring over the \nlast embers of the earlier rhythms, building with imperceptible grace towards \npeaks that Oldfield had not scaled since side one of Ommadawn. Certainly it is \none of his most breathtaking pieces of playing; equally importantly, it is also \none of his loveliest melodies.\n\nAn excellent live version of &quot;Platinum&quot; appears on the 1985 Complete Mike \nOldfield compilation. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work \nin your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c53e0fecde10603d97d0997e6a09fb847e739e","amp;dn":"Mike+Oldfield+-+The+Complete+%282+CD%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c53e0fecde10603d97d0997e6a09fb847e739e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,197,62,15,236,222,16,96,61,151,208,153,126,106,9,251,132,126,115,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
