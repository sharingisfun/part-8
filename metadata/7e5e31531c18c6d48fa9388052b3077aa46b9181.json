Then Respect The Developers By Buying Their Games Using The &quot;MARKETPLACE&quot; On Your Windows Phone.\n\n1. To be able to install The Apps you need to Jailbreak your phone. Visit www.xda-developers.com/ to learn how to unlock your Windows Phone.\n2. Many of these are tested on my Samsung Omnia 7, however I cannot guarantee compatibility (although there is no reason why) across all models. \n3. I accept no responsibility for anything. Use at your own risk! \n4. All the hard work has been done by other talented coders. I take no credit other than providing their hard work in a simple torrent.\n5. I won't have my computer on all the time, so sadly it may take a while to get this torrent seeding quickly! \n\nInstallation:\nUnpack the 'Tom XAP Installer v1.1.zip', from XDA Developers and run the 'Tom XAP Installer.exe'\nCheck the Enable Tom XAP installer checkbox, and you're done!  It was quite easy, isn't it? \nYou can uninstall it, by simply un-checking the checkbox.\nBefore you do anything:\nPlease make sure your device is Jailbroken\nMake sure your device is connected with PC and Zune lauched \nMake sure your device not in sleep mode\n\nHow to deploy XAPs with it:\nOk, now you've got your XAP, and want to deploy it to your Device/Emulator.\n\nProviding you've done the steps described in the Installation part, when you double click the XAP file\n\nChoose the location you want to install it to, and press 'Install' to deploy it to the Device/Emu.\n\nMethod #2 (NEW)\nDownload  WP7-DEPLOY and unpack somewhere (original item and thread is somewhere on XDA-DEVELOPERS)\n\nRun WP7-DEPLOY (just tick the top two boxes - see picture) and close, then create a shortcut to wp7-deploy on your desktop and drag the xap onto the wp7-deploy shortcut. Make sure Zune is running and hey presto.\n\nThat's it, you've done it \nNote: If it's a free item then clear the check boxes before deploying.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5e31531c18c6d48fa9388052b3077aa46b9181","amp;dn":"Collection+of+Windows+Phone+7+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5e31531c18c6d48fa9388052b3077aa46b9181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,94,49,83,28,24,198,212,143,169,56,128,82,179,7,122,164,107,145,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
