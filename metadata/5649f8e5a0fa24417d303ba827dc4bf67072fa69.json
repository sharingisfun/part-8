But all is not as it seems and the X-Men are caught up in the web of vengeance in a desperate battle through time. The event presages Messiah Complex in many ways and despite being received to mixed reviews as it was released, I still find it a compelling read that gives insight into Cable as well as Stryfe and a few others. This torrent contains all 12 issues pf the X-Cutioner's Song saga, all in digital format. The final two files are the first epilogue in Uncanny X-Men 297, as well as Stryfe's Strike File published in 1995. The second epilogue, X-Force 19, is NOT included as I could not find a digital version but after re-reading it I don't think it is necessary to the story. Massive thanks to Meganubis-Empire for the rips, and please seed and enjoy! :-)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5649f8e5a0fa24417d303ba827dc4bf67072fa69","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+X-Cutioner%27s+Song+%281992-1993%2C+Dgtl%2C+Meganubis-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5649f8e5a0fa24417d303ba827dc4bf67072fa69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,73,248,229,160,250,36,65,125,48,59,168,39,220,75,246,112,114,250,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
