For many of us it will continue to shape where we live, pray, go to school, and socialize. We cannot simply wish away the existence of race or racism, but we can take steps to lessen the ways in which the categories trap and confine us. Educators, who should be committed to helping young people realize their intellectual potential as they make their way toward adulthood, have a responsibility to help them find ways to expand identities related to race so that they can experience the fullest possibility of all that they may become. In this brutally honestÃ¢â‚¬â€yet ultimately hopefulÃ¢â‚¬â€ book Pedro Noguera examines the many facets of race in schools and society and reveals what it will take to improve outcomes for all students. From achievement gaps to immigration, Noguera offers a rich and compelling picture of a complex issue that affects all of us.\n\n\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\nInfluenced by culture and aware of the lack of prospects for them, black boys in particular, but minority students of all kinds, make the kinds of poor choices that fulfill the low expectations of their teachers and the broader society. Education professor Noguera examines the cultural, societalÃ¢â‚¬â€and personalÃ¢â‚¬â€factors that create the stubborn link between race and poverty. In this compelling series of essays, Noguera cites research and his own personal experienceÃ¢â‚¬â€as a minority, a father, and an educatorÃ¢â‚¬â€to explore the myriad ways that young black and Hispanic males are expected to run afoul of middle-class American norms and often do. He argues that public schools, despite their abysmal record, are the only institutions with the access and resources to turn around troubling social trends. He points to research comparing the disciplinary tactics of public schools and prisons, institutions that have far too much in common with so many male minority students dropping out of schools and landing in prison. A thoughtful look at issues of race and educational equity. --Vanessa Bush --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\nReview\nInfluenced by culture and aware of the lack of prospects for them,black boys in particular, but minority students of all kinds, make the kinds of poor choices that fulfill the low expectations of their teachers and the broader society.
