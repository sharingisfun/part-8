You don't have to look far to see someone who struggles daily with the physical and emotional issues related to being overweight. Everyday life is difficult for this population. It seems the world is just not designed for people of size. Sports venues, airplanes, restaurants, etc. all present challenges for the obese. \r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is to lose weight. That sounds simple to someone who is a &quot;normal&quot; size, but is a daunting, seemingly impossible task for those whose weight is out of control. Most have tried and failed many times. It just can't be done, right? Wrong! \r\n\r\nVictory Over Obesity is the story of how I overcame self-doubt, fears, and all of the usual excuses to get in the best shape of my life. I am now happy and healthy and you can be too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa0d2101d37506477c209f805f2b1a1e680a9e3","amp;dn":"Victory+Over+Obesity+by+Lisa+Wrobel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa0d2101d37506477c209f805f2b1a1e680a9e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,160,210,16,29,55,80,100,119,194,9,248,5,242,177,161,230,128,169,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
