I saw them \r\nthe week before in Detroit and had good \r\nseats but decided not to tape there or here \r\nbut with a perfect view and no security I \r\ndecided to tape.  I fee this is 1 of the best \r\nI have ever done and think I might pay the huge \r\nprices and it close for the now on because \r\nI am old and it is just different up front!  \r\nAnyway, video is great like I said.  I did \r\nmiss the first 5 seconds of Stairway because \r\nwe were thinking Misty Mountain Hop and were \r\nparked so far away.  But, after the first \r\nnote we decided to stay because it was our \r\nfirst stairway!  Last 10 seconds cut as well \r\nas we did get stuck for 15 in lot but have \r\nbeen stuck hours before and can't do that again.\r\nEnjoy the show as I will be cutting my taping \r\ndown in the years to come and enjoy more! \r\n\r\nThe following are video specs for 1 song but \r\nare the same for all the songs! \r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : QuickTime\r\nCodec ID                                 : qt   2007.09.04 (qt  /pana)\r\nFile size                                : 575 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 4mn 29s\r\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 17.9 Mbps\r\nWriting library                          : pana\r\nIsTruncated                              : Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e73100f6c47cd2c9fa4606af7efecb1f87e669","amp;dn":"Heart+2016-07-21+First+Niagara+Center+-+mov+-+cam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e73100f6c47cd2c9fa4606af7efecb1f87e669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,231,49,0,246,196,124,210,201,250,70,6,175,126,254,203,31,135,230,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
