To trigger his memory his family, who need him to remember his Swiss bank account numbers, stage elaborate psychodramas from his childhood and then plunge him, sometimes quite cruelly, into the action. The props and costumes for these plays within a play come from a gigantic warehouse, reminiscent of CITIZEN KANE, which contains all of the family's memorabilia. Along with this recreated past, and the present time story, Saura adds three other time frames; the past memories of Antonio, his tellingly strange fears and hallucinations and, as he starts to recover, his murderous fantasies for the future. This family drama of greed and power struggles is perhaps a sly political reference to the state of the Spanish government in the waning years of the Franco dictatorship. A time when Franco was thought to be senile and trying to cling to power with elaborate pageantry and fanciful calls to celebrate a falsely glorious past.\n\nFile Name .............: El.jardin.de.las.delicias.(1970).Xvid.mp3.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 736,872,448 bytes\nRuntime : 1:31:13\nVideo Codec ...........: XVID\nFrame Size ............: 544x336\nFPS ...................: 25.0\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1578 kb/s\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1 \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065913/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065913/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; English subtitles ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11f80a453011419e39c248d949aaf475192ffd0","amp;dn":"Carlos+Saura+-+El+Jardin+de+las+Delicias+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11f80a453011419e39c248d949aaf475192ffd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,31,128,164,83,1,20,25,227,156,36,141,148,154,175,71,81,146,255,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
