Due to this growing problem, many patients are being managed by non-cardiovascular physicians in the inpatient setting. As a result, hospitalists and other inpatient physicians without specialized training in cardiology are faced with uncertainty when contemplating the proper management of these patients.\n\nThis book focuses on inpatient cardiovascular medicine in a highly algorithmic and evidence-based approach, so that users will be able to care for their hospitalized patients directly, using the best contemporary evidence available. It emphasizes the practical, immediate application of principles and treatment recommendations into everyday clinical inpatient practice, while simplifying the approach to these patients by utilizing visual aids such as carefully designed charts, illustrations, and diagrams.\n\nInpatient Cardiovascular Medicine features thoughtful, comprehensive coverage by top experts in the field. Topics include:\n\nCardiovascular History and Physical Examination\nIntroduction to Electrocardiography\nNon-invasive Cardiac Imaging\nCardiac Stress Testing and the Evaluation of Chest Pain\nPerioperative Cardiac Evaluation\nCardiac Resuscitation\nAcute Coronary Syndromes: Unstable Angina and Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction\nAcute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction\nChronic Coronary Artery Disease\nPeripheral Arterial Disease\nThoracic Aortic Disease\nSystolic Heart Failure\nDiastolic Heart Failure\nDilated and Restrictive Cardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\nHeart Transplantation and Left Ventricular Assist Devices\nSyncope\nApproach to the Patient with a Narrow Complex Tachycardia\nApproach to the Patient with a Wide Complex Tachycardia\nAtrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter\nAntiarrhythmic Drug Therapy\nCardiac Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators\nValvular Heart Disease\nInfective Endocarditis\nPericardial Diseases\nPulmonary Hypertension\nCardiac Tumors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fc0d4cfbe8b6422bcd1c10546eb480bc3350e4","amp;dn":"Inpatient+Cardiovascular+Medicine+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fc0d4cfbe8b6422bcd1c10546eb480bc3350e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,252,13,76,251,232,182,66,43,205,28,16,84,110,180,128,188,51,80,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
