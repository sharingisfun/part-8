One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the HolocaustÃ¢â‚¬â€only to be met by uncomprehending looks.\n\nSo she and her students, using the treasured books Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and ZlataÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diary: A ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life in Sarajevo as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding. They learned to see the parallels in these books to their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freedom WritersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in homage to the civil rights activists Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Freedom Riders.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWith funds raised by a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Read-a-thon for Tolerance,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they arranged for Miep Gies, the courageous Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California, where she declared that Erin GruwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s students were Ã¢â‚¬Å“the real heroes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognitionÃ¢â‚¬â€appearances on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Prime Time LiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Things Considered,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ coverage in People magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard RileyÃ¢â‚¬â€and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers have graduated from high school and are now attending college.\n\nWith powerful entries from the studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own diaries and a narrative text by Erin Gruwell, The Freedom Writers Diary is an uplifting, unforgettable example of how hard work, courage, and the spirit of determination changed the lives of a teacher and her students.\n\n\n\nNote: At time of uploading this book both file types have been tried out on my Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) using Aldiko for the epub file and Kindle for the mobi file.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6c66246fe93db4e6c8e5b24459533de5742c16","amp;dn":"The+Freedom+Writers+Diary+ebook+with+Erin+Gruwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6c66246fe93db4e6c8e5b24459533de5742c16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,108,102,36,111,233,61,180,230,200,229,178,68,89,83,61,229,116,44,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
