KEEP IT ALIVE!\n\n\n&quot;Human&quot; is a song by Las Vegas-based alternative rock band The Killers, and was released as the first single from the band's third studio album Day &amp; Age. It began receiving airplay on September 22, with a digital release on September 30.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine's Smoking Section, Brandon Flowers described &quot;Human&quot; as &quot;like Johnny Cash meets the Pet Shop Boys&quot; and confessed to not putting it on Sawdust as &quot;it was too good&quot;. There have been several mis-conceptions regarding the use and pronouncation of the word &quot;denser&quot; used in the line &quot;Are we human or are we denser?&quot; with many forum users and critics questioning Brandon Flowers' use of the word &quot;dancer&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ee32f92fa283bb27440df4953aa4b6556c3db2","amp;dn":"The+Killers+-+Day+%26+Age+-+Human+%28Single%29+-+320+kbps+-+2008+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ee32f92fa283bb27440df4953aa4b6556c3db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,238,50,249,47,162,131,187,39,68,13,244,149,58,164,182,85,108,61,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
