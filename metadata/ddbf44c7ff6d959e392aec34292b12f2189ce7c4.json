It is a low-level introductory text which takes the topics at a gentle pace, covering all the essential material that forms the background for studies in computing and information systems. This edition includes new sections on proof methods and recurrences, and the examples have been updated throughout to reflect the changes in computing since the first edition. \nAbout the Author \nPETER GROSSMAN has worked in both academic and industrial roles as a mathematician and computing professional. As a lecturer in mathematics, he was responsible for co-ordination and subject development of mathematics subjects for Computing students. He currently works in industry, in the areas of mathematical modelling and software development.
