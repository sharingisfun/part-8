This excellent new recording makes a plea for its return to the core repertoire, and rightly so. Itâ€™s a splendid work, full of beautiful singing tunes, lyric outbursts, and perilous virtuosity, haunted by a romantic, almost legendary atmosphere of great effect. With its introspection and melancholy, the second movement (Air) incarnates the expressive heart of the piece, though the two others stand right next to it in terms of quality of writing, formal balance, and poetic intensity. Sarah Chang delivers one of her best performances to date: her tone is warm and rich, her technique secure.\r\nOnce again, James Conlon gets successfully involved in an interesting revival. He conducts the Prometheus Bound Overture with energy and a real sense of drama, and accompanies Chang with the most flexible ear, stimulating the soloist with abundant colors and lively rhythms. Although sometimes lacking precision, notably in the brass section, the KÃ¶lner Philharmoniker plays with obvious pleasure and interest in the music. The slightly distant and dry recording closely captures the musicâ€™s generous gestures.\r\n\r\nViolin Concerto in A minor, Op.28 (1877)\r\n1. I. Allegro moderato [15.22]\r\n2.
