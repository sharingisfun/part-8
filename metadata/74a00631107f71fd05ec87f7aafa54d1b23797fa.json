Heightened awareness of breast cancer risk in the past decades has led to an increase in the number of women undergoing mammography for screening, leading to detection of cancers in earlier stages and a resultant improvement in survival rates. Still, breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women between the ages of 45 and 55. This book presents the latest research in the field. \n\n\n# Hardcover: 256 pages\n# Publisher: Nova Science Publishers; 1 edition (January 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1608768813\n# ISBN-13: 978-1608768813","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a00631107f71fd05ec87f7aafa54d1b23797fa","amp;dn":"Aggressive+Breast+Cancer+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a00631107f71fd05ec87f7aafa54d1b23797fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,160,6,49,16,127,113,253,5,236,135,247,170,250,84,209,178,55,151,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
