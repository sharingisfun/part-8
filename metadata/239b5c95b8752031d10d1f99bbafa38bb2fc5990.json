Their first all-killer-no-filler album &quot;Goin' Under&quot;, released in 2014 (2013 in Scandinavia), was soaked in the true spirit of the NWOBHM and showed that great heavy metal music still can be made. With bands like IRON MAIDEN, SAXON, THIN LIZZY and '70s-era SCORPIONS amongst their influences, BLACK TRIP really paid both homage and respect to the classic metal sound that runs through the veins of every metalhead, and yet they have their own distinct sound and direction.\n\nNow, two years on from that critcally acclaimed debut they are about to release their second album, &quot;Shadowline&quot;, which vocalist Joseph Tholl describes as &quot;a bigger, more diverse and more personal album, but still dark, heavy metal rock&quot;. Guitarist Peter StjÃƒÂ¤rnvind adds: &quot;The album whilst heavy is also groovy and catchy and just makes you feel happy in a really good way.&quot;\n\n\nYear:\t2015\nStyle:\tHeavy Metal\nCountry:\tSweden\nFormat:\t320 mp3\nSize:\t95.56 MB\n\n\t\nAdded:\t27/08/2015 19:00:31\nFiles:\t15\n\nDescription:\t\n\n\nLength : 00:41:11\n\n\n01.
