The international lineup puts \nthe tune in tune-up as the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cars\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; characters hit the road \non a worldwide tour full of epic adventure. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Cars 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is   \nthe fourth Pixar feature score for Giacchino, who has     \npreviously composed the music for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Incredibles,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;      \n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Ratatouille,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Up,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; along with half a dozen short    \nfilms from the Studio. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Michael is doing such a cool score\nfor the film,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; says director John Lasseter. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;We did not   \nwant to do a typical spy movie score. We wanted it to be  \nsomething very different-a whole new approach.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;John    \n[Lasseter] knows the story,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; says Giacchino. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;He knows    \nwhat his characters need and what they want. That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how to\ndiscuss music-in emotions. If Mater is feeling left out, I\ncan translate that into music. I love working with the    \npeople at Pixar because they all talk in terms of story   \nand that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s how I love to work.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;                           \n\n\n\nGroup E-Mail: \n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0b7f6a607e666a7978666465606e724b6c666a626725686466&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;  \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Music!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b34a4cffdf2add9b41a745c5cf191bae143f9c47","amp;dn":"VA-Cars+2-OST-2011-TAKU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b34a4cffdf2add9b41a745c5cf191bae143f9c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,74,76,255,223,42,221,155,65,167,69,197,207,25,27,174,20,63,156,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
