And their hits &quot;Steppin' Out,&quot; &quot;Just Like Me,&quot; &quot;Hungry,&quot; &quot;Him or Me-What's It Gonna Be,&quot; and &quot;Kicks,&quot; in particular, are now seen by compilers as bold, unpretentious pieces of '60s rock &amp; roll with a defiant, punk edge. Paul Revere was born on January 7, 1938 in Harvard, NE. He learned to play the piano as a boy, and developed a keen appreciation for the work of Spike Jones &amp; His City Slickers. He joined his first real band while in his teens, and was later joined by 16-year-old Mark Lindsay (b. March 9, 1942), a singer/saxman who ended up replacing the group's vocalist. Called the Downbeats, they were popular at local dances, and cut a demo for Gardena Records in Los Angeles, where the company's owner was interested in issuing a record, but only if they changed their name. Revere's given name was such a natural as a gimmick that they became Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Their third single, a Jerry Lee Lewis-style instrumental, charted low in the Hot 100, and by the middle of 1963, they were one of the major music attractions in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-revere-the-raiders-p118074/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-revere-the-raiders-p118074/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThis double-CD set presents a real conundrum, on a lot of levels. For starters, on its face, 55 songs may well seem like overkill to the casual fan who only knows or remembers (or thinks they only remember) five or six big hits by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. And there are more modest single-CD collections to be found on this band that seem less daunting. But as it turns out -- for those who give this set a try -- Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders did have just enough hits, when coupled with a sufficient number of respected album tracks and B-sides, to sustain a double-CD set. And that goes double for anyone who likes plain old rock &amp; roll -- even when this band got ambitious and a little bit progressive and serious, they never lost sight of the value of a great beat and carefully placed vocal and instrumental hooks, and they were always fun. The truth is, whether it was the classic lineup playing frat rock or an early-'70s version of the band delving into more complex songs, these guys delivered high-quality music across a decade, from 1964 through 1974, and it's all represented here. And amazingly, this was the first Raiders compilation to include &quot;Indian Reservation,&quot; the group's only number one hit, or to place it alongside their earlier round of hits, so that one can hear their progression from Pacific Northwest dance rock to smoothly professional AM pop/rock, absorbing elements of the British Invasion, garage punk, and psychedelia along the way. ...\n\nRead all of the review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/legend-of-paul-revere-r16492/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/legend-of-paul-revere-r16492/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000026UY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000026UY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
