The book will also appeal to seasoned photographers looking for new ways to capture the moments around them in a more meaningful and personal way.&quot;--Publishers Weekly\n\nRenowned photographer George LangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is guided by one simple truth: An unforgettable photograph is not about what the subject looks like, but what it feels like. In this entirely new kind of photography guide, written by Mr. Lange and Scott Mowbray, magazine editor and longtime amateur photographer, the rest of us will learn how to take photographs that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just document life but celebrate it.\n\nNo fancy equipment required. Just hundreds of simple, inspiring ideas and lessonsÃ¢â‚¬â€each one illustrated with a photographÃ¢â‚¬â€organized around the six essential principles of seeing like a photographer. (HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one: Shoot the Moment, Not the Subject.)\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why to shoot in natural lightÃ¢â‚¬â€always. The fun of putting babies in surprising places. How to get intimate with food. Using a dramatic sky as your backdrop. The benefit of learning to know the light in every room of your house. Shooting hands or feet instead of faces. How to move past the Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was hereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ postcard effect. How to catch the in-between moments. Because in the end, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about living the moment, shooting the momentÃ¢â‚¬â€and being in the moment forever.\n\nThe Unforgettable Photograph - September 10, 2013\nBook Language: English \nPages: 337\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 50.02 MB\n\nISBN-10: 0761169237\nISBN-13: 978-0761169239\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HnmE2YD.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HnmE2YD.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34664645f2eaa1e1dee03bad287aed10668481b","amp;dn":"The+Unforgettable+Photograph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34664645f2eaa1e1dee03bad287aed10668481b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,70,100,100,95,46,170,30,29,238,3,186,210,135,174,209,6,104,72,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
