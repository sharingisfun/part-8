His songs like I'm a King Bee or Shake Your Hips were covered by Muddy Waters, the Rolling Stones, the Pretty Things, the Yardbirds, the Kinks, Them, the Grateful Dead and the Doors. And Shake Your Hips was the inspiration for ZZ Top's La Grange.\n\ntracklist:\n\n1. Baby scratch my back \n2. I got love if you want it \n3. I'm a King bee \n4.
