His mastery of prewar blues techniques is matched by an encyclopaedic interest in music both popular and arcane. His unwillingness to be typecast as a musician of one particular style may yet become career-threatening.\nFew artist in the last decade have released such an impressive and accomplished debut album. Hart steps up to the plate as a confirmed but inventive traditionalist, combining works by Charley Patton, Blind Willie McTell and Leadbelly with songs that set original lyrics to tunes in the styles of Bukka White, Kokomo Arnold and others, and does it with no hint of parody or imitation. The spontaneity and clarity of his slide guitar playing on 'Joe Friday' and 'Rest Your Saddle' are complemented by the ebullience of his idiomatic vocals. 'Pony Blues' and Papa Harvey Hull's 'France Blues' are recast with complex but flowing guitar parts, while McTell's 'Hillbilly Willie's Blues' is performed on banjo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9be3df988c0b6c1e5f959aa2424bec6df1ab571a","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Alvin+Youngblood+Hart+-+Big+Mama%5C%27s+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9be3df988c0b6c1e5f959aa2424bec6df1ab571a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,227,223,152,140,11,108,30,95,149,154,162,66,75,236,109,241,171,87,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
