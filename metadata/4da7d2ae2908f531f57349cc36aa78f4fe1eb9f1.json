They beat 15 other bands to win the contest and were featured on the August 18, 2011 cover of Rolling Stone magazine, the first unsigned act to do so. During the competition, the band made appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival as well The Osheaga Festival in Montreal, Quebec. The band has recently signed with Atlantic Records with a new album being produced by The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney.[2]\n\nThe band's Five Easy Pieces EP debuted at No. 7 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 3,300 copies.[3] On September 22, 2011, the band won the three CASBY Awards they were nominated for.
