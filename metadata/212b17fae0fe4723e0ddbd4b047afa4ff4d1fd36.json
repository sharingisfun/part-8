And &quot;reading is seeing more than you've ever imagined when in the masterful hands of acclaimed author Diana Wynne Jones. Here are seven talesÃ¢â‚¬â€seven doorways to bizarre, yet strangely familiar worldsÃ¢â‚¬â€to transport one and all. In these worlds are a child born to an ordered society but preordained to spread Dissolution . . . a girl who so loves the sun that she renounces her humanity for eternity . . . a cat and a boy, held captive by an evil magician until they can find a bigger magic of their own . . . a woman imprisoned in a strange country dominated by three ravenous wolves . . . and many other characters and stories just as exceptional. These richly drawn, razor-sharp stories showcase the skills and sheer narrative power of one of the most esteemed fantasy writers of our time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212b17fae0fe4723e0ddbd4b047afa4ff4d1fd36","amp;dn":"Believing+Is+Seeing+-+Seven+Stories+-+Diana+Wynne+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212b17fae0fe4723e0ddbd4b047afa4ff4d1fd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,43,23,250,224,254,71,35,224,221,189,75,4,122,250,79,244,209,253,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
