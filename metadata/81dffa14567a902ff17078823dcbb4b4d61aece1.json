When he was ten, he was already playing the keyboard and drums in bars and hotels. Darren Hayes' show business experience extended no further than his involvement in many school plays. When Jones and the band he'd started with his brothers advertised for a singer, the inexperienced but enthusiastic Hayes was the only hopeful to answer. He wasn't what was needed for a covers band playing the Gold Coast resort area of Queensland, but Hayes inspired a different flame in Jones and the pair broke away to start writing original songs. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tRoadshow Music\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Affirmation\n02.Hold Me\n03.I Knew I Loved You\n04.The Best Thing\n05.Crash And Burn\n06.Chained To You\n07.The Animal Song\n08.The Lover After Me\n09.Two Beds And A Coffee Machine\n10.You Can Still Be Free\n11.Gunning Down Romance\n12.I Don't Know You Anymore\n\n\n\nTHANKS TO &quot;only1joe&quot; FOR HIS PREVIOUS UPLOAD!\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81dffa14567a902ff17078823dcbb4b4d61aece1","amp;dn":"Savage+Garden+-+Affirmation+%281999%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81dffa14567a902ff17078823dcbb4b4d61aece1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,223,250,20,86,122,144,47,241,112,120,130,61,203,180,180,214,26,236,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
