It is the liveliest and probably the most widely read philosophical journal in Britain. This anthology reprints some of the best articles to have appeared in the journal during the past five years. It covers topics in social and moral philosophy which are central to current controversies on the left, focusing on theoretical issues raised by the socialist, feminist and environmental movements.\nTopics covered include feminist perspectives on a range of traditional philosophical issues and contemporary problems; theoretical questions involved in the rethinking of socialism and Marxism; and questions about the relation between humanity and nature raised by environmental debates. The pieces included engage with contemporary issues in critical terms, and represent the best of recent philosophical work on the left. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in the current state of radical thought.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37483756e56d2a33cf1ac7023c3a8175df2792c7","amp;dn":"Socialism+%2C+Feminism+and+Philosphy+-+Sayer.+Sean+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37483756e56d2a33cf1ac7023c3a8175df2792c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,72,55,86,229,109,42,51,207,26,199,2,60,58,129,117,223,39,146,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
