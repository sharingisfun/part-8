Wait no more. Get up to speed quickly on the Qt Framework using a real world example. This course will teach you both critical portions of the Qt Framework and teach you how to use the tools that come with the framework including the very powerful Qt Creator IDE. By the end of this course you'll be comfortable building GUI front ends for the desktop as well as learning how to work with JSON data files and the Networking components of Qt. You'll also become a pro at using the signals and slots mechanism for communicating between classes and processes.
