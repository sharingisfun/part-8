Out Of The Fire (7:50)\n\nAsked what she had been doing in the 16 years since her previous album, Iris DeMent replied drolly: &quot;I painted the living room a lot of different colours.&quot;\nThe 51-year-old from Arkansas released her last album of original material in 1996 with The Way I Should and she returns in fine style with Sing The Delta. The songs on her new album grow richer and more rewarding the more you hear them.\nDeMent comes from a musical family and says she got from her religious parents that &quot;music was something to lean on&quot;. The songs about her early childhood in Arkansas - where she would sometimes attend a Pentecostal church seven days a week - are tales of love and pained stories of death and faith questioned. DeMent says that it &quot;scares her what an awesome thing it is to wrote songs and put your heart out there&quot; and that's why she writes so little. But it's something to savour when she does.\nHer songwriting has always been complex - Our Town and Easy's Gettin' Harder Every Day from the 1990s are two of the strongest country songs of that decade - and reaches new levels of poignancy on the sorrowful Morning Glory.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc725b8f3ad2ef7f9006f49be0eb1188de9d9083","amp;dn":"Iris+Dement+-+Sing+The+Delta+%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc725b8f3ad2ef7f9006f49be0eb1188de9d9083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,114,91,143,58,210,239,127,144,6,244,155,224,235,17,136,222,157,144,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
