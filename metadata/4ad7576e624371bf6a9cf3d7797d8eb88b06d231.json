Playing standards such as &quot;Body And Soul,&quot; &quot;All The Things You Are,&quot; and &quot;In A Sentimental Mood,&quot; the leader was careful to state the melodies first and let them settle before launching into improvised adventures. While itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true that &quot;everybody talks during the bass solo,&quot; Eastwood and tenor saxophonist Doug Webb had the audienceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ear because they were offering a product that contained both quality and comfort.\nRecorded at Capitol Studios in Hollywood, the recording features: EastwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quartet with 3 originals, a big band with 5 arrangements from Vince Mendoza, and 2 more songs with small ensemble. Vocalists Joni Mitchell, Julia Fordham, and Diana King sit in for one track each. Kyle Eastwood shares the spotlight on most numbers and provides creative acoustic bass solo segments. The quartet includes Eastwood, Webb, pianist Matt McGuire, and drummer Kendall Kay. McGuireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s composition &quot;Watch, Watch&quot; is a dramatic up-tempo modern mainstream piece with an exciting drive to it. Similarly, &quot;Chaff and Grain&quot; and &quot;Da Da Ba Ba Nu Nu&quot; explore contemporary harmonic and rhythmic concepts in an acoustic format. The pure tone of WebbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soprano saxophone floats above &quot;Chaff and Grain,&quot; which Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at eight and a half minutes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the longest piece as well as the sessionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highlight.\nJoni Mitchell and tenor saxophonist Plas Johnson (who readers may remember as the original Pink Panther sax man) deliver Marvin GayeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blues-drenched &quot;Trouble Man.&quot; Diana KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dramatic &quot;Why CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t We Live Together&quot; maintains the seriousness of Timmy ThomasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics while she and tenor saxophonist David Sanchez drive the message home. Julia FordhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear alto voice and Oscar BrashearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big fat trumpet stand in front of the big band for &quot;In the Wee Small Hours (of the Morning).&quot; Similarly, soprano saxophonist Steve Tavaglione and pianist Billy Childs reap the orchestraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrangement of McGuireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ballad &quot;Solace.&quot; Trumpeter Sal Marquez guests on the hard bop &quot;Enter Evening,&quot; which serves to demonstrate the function of bassist as rhythm-maker. WebbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s composition &quot;Stanley Hill Drive&quot; and Tom WaitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ &quot;I Beg Your Pardon&quot; feature trumpeter Mark Isham and saxophonist Sanchez with the big band. Kyle EastwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut recording proves his love of good acoustic jazz and reveals a stand-up bass talent that emphasizes the melody. Highly recommended.
