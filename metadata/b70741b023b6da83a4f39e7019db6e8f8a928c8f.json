We're counting down the biggest hits in the nation, and on we go.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener asks, &quot;So far in the 80's, have any albums hit number one without producing any top 40 singles?&quot; Incredibly, Casey reports two albums that couldn't manage to place a single in the top 40 even though they topped the album chart. One was by a legendary Australian band. The highest climbing single from that album only got as high as number 44 in 1982. The other album was by an iconic singer/actress. Its highest climbing single release rose only to number 43 in 1986. Casey plays bits of both singles. Something to remember; when things don't go like you think they should, it is that way for everybody sooner or later.\n\nCasey explains that when Sheena Easton went on tour earlier in the year, she was missing the man who played keyboard for her the three years prior. He had gone solo, and has his latest hit in this countdown.\n\nThe first time most of us ever heard the name &quot;Bruce Willis,&quot; he was co-starring in a popular television show called &quot;Moonlighting.&quot; Its theme song (sung by Al Jarreau) is at number 25.\n\nThere is an artist in this countdown who started writing songs at age 4, won $1000 in a song writing contest at age 12, and has her first hit in this countdown at age 16. When you sometimes see children in the media spotlight who grow up so quickly, essentially as adults before their time, rest assured I am keeping the balance as an adult who still hasn't grown up or learned how to tell time.\n\nThe song at number 13 is &quot;Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; by The Nylons. It is a remake of a 1969 number one  record by a group called Steam, and if you didn't know Casey would play some of the original, you probably didn't remember to go to your appointment with the amnesia doctor either.\n\nMany radio stations wouldn't play George Micheal's song, &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; (at number 5 this week), not wanting to offend their listeners. Several times I commented that Casey wouldn't say the title of the song because I incorrectly thought it was offensive to him. So I offer my apologies, (and it always seems to turn out this way when I try that thinking stuff).\n\nLW#1:  Alone - Heart\n40:    Love Power - Dionne Warwick &amp; Jeffrey Osborne\n39:    Since You've Been Gone - The Outfield\n38:    One For The Mockingbird - Cutting Crew            \n37:    Just To See Her - Smokey Robinson\n36:    Hypnotize Me (From &quot;Innerspace&quot;) - Wang Chung\n35:    Living In A Box - Living In A Box\n34:    Can't We Try - Dan Hill (with Vonda Shepard)\n33:    Always - Atlantic Starr\n32:    It's Not Over ('Til It's Over) - Starship\n31:    Head To Toe - Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam\n30:    La Bamba - Los Lobos\n29:    Hearts On Fire - Bryan Adams\n28:    Every Little Kiss - Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range\n27:    Seven Wonders - Fleetwood Mac\nLDD:   Endless Love - Diana Ross &amp; Lionel Richie\n26:    Who's That Girl - Madonna\n25:    Moonlighting (Theme) - Al Jarreau\n24:    Back In The High Life Again - Steve Winwood\n23:    Rock Steady - The Whispers\n22:    Don't Mean Nothing - Richard Marx\n21:    Only In My Dreams - Debbie Gibson\n20:    Happy - Surface\n19:    Songbird - Kenny G.\n18:    I'd Still Say Yes - Klymaxx\n17:    The Pleasure Principal - Janet Jackson\n16:    Wot's It To Ya - Robbie Nevil\n15:    Luka - Suzanne Vega\n14:    Cross My Broken Heart - The Jets\n13:    Kiss Him Goodbye - The Nylons\n12:    Girls, Girls, Girls - Motley Crue\n11:    Funkytown - Pseudo Echo\n10:    Point Of No Return - Expose\n9:    Don't Disturb This Groove - The System\n8:    Heart And Soul - T'pau\nLDD:  Stuck On You - Lionel Richie\n7:    Something So Strong - Crowded House\n6:    Rhythm Is Gonna Get You - Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine\n5:    I Want Your Sex - George Michael\n4:    I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) - Whitney Houston\n3:    I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - U2\n2:    Shakedown - Bob Seger\n1:    Alone - Heart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b70741b023b6da83a4f39e7019db6e8f8a928c8f","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1987_July_25th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b70741b023b6da83a4f39e7019db6e8f8a928c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,7,65,176,35,182,218,131,164,243,158,112,25,219,110,143,138,146,140,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
