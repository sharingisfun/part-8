FWA leader Devlin frees a cyber-hacker named Zak from prison and sends him to infiltrate the complex and discover the true nature of the Cyberia weapon.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cartel is also interested in the weapon and will stop at nothing to get it. Not only must Zak make his way past the Cartel forces sent to stop him, but he must also overcome the Cartel agents which have already seized control of the complex. To make matters worse the Cyberian scientist's genetically engineered creations are running rampant in the same area as he weapon, and Devlin also appears to be have something up his sleeve.\n\nGame Information\nÃ‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯\nFound the game on eDonkey, thanks to Sihaya's site. Remember, this is not Syberia by Microids. Tested on Windows XP Home Edition. Used DOSBox and the Frontend D-Fend. Used Daemon-Tools to Mount the CD Image. The CD Drive had to be the first one, or D:, in my case. That can be done with DOSBox if you mount it properly. Another way is through Disk Management if don't plan to use DOSBox.\n\nFile size comparison between the RAR and the Extracted contents:\n\n173MB RAR\n287MB Extracted\n\nLinks\nÃ‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯\nMobyGames\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/cyberia\n\nA few Reviews\nhttp://www.adventurecollective.com/reviews/cyberia.htm\nhttp://www.csoon.com/issue3/cyberia.htm\n\n\nWould anyone be interested in Cyberia 2: Resurrection? I ask because it's a 2 CD game that totals up to 1.09GB. If I don't post it, you can always get the game from eDonkey or at yztay's DC Hub. Info about the DC hub is at the AGC front page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa254b62feb056f3e0e93b18540bd4d8b7bebabd","amp;dn":"Cyberia+%281994%29%28DOS%29%28ISO+in+RAR%29%28by+AGCnet+tk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa254b62feb056f3e0e93b18540bd4d8b7bebabd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,37,75,98,254,176,86,243,224,233,59,24,84,11,212,216,183,190,186,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
