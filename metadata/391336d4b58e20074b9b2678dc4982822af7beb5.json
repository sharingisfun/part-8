Fitzgerald's assured and elegant voice is a perfect match for Mercer's urbane lyrics and Nelson Riddle's supple arrangements. In light of this decorous setting, it's not surprising that Mercer's swagger-heavy numbers like &quot;I Wanna Be Around&quot; and &quot;One More For My Baby&quot; are skipped in favor of more poised selections such as &quot;Early Autumn&quot; and &quot;Skylark.&quot; Even traditionally hard-swinging numbers such as &quot;Day In Day Out&quot; and &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; are kept in check with Riddle's vaporous, flute-heavy backing and Fitzgerald's velvet tone. Slower numbers like &quot;Laura&quot; and &quot;Midnight Sun&quot; add dramatic contrast with their enigmatic tonal backdrops and elongated vocal phrasing. Fitzgerald's Mercer songbook has become something of an overlooked gem partly because of the popularity of her Cole Porter and Gershwin collections. It's a shame, because this songbook is beautifully executed by Fitzgerald and Riddle and contains wonderful Mercer collaborations with, among others, Harold Arlen and Hoagy Charmichael. This is definitely one for any Fitzgerald fan and not a bad introduction to her vast catalog.
