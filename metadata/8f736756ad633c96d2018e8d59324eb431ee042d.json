He was discovered by blues and jazz historian Frederick Ramsey III, and subsequently championed by boyhood friend Jesse Colin Young, who released his 2nd &amp; 3rd albums on The Youngbloods\\' Warner Bros. imprint, Raccoon.[2] In the late 1970s, Hurley made three albums for Rounder, all of which have since been reissued on CD. His 1976 LP Have Moicy, a collaboration with the Unholy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick &amp; The Clamtones, was named \\&quot;the greatest folk album of the rock era\\&quot; by The Village Voice\\'s Robert Christgau.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f736756ad633c96d2018e8d59324eb431ee042d","amp;dn":"Michael+Hurley++Armchair+Boogie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f736756ad633c96d2018e8d59324eb431ee042d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,115,103,86,173,99,60,150,210,1,142,141,89,50,78,180,49,238,4,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
