In 2010 they released their debut full-length album Opus Eponymous. The Grammis-nominated album was widely praised and increased their popularity significantly.\n\nGhost are often recognized due to their eccentric on-stage presence. Five of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s six members wear hooded robes, while the vocalist appears in a skull mask and a cardinal outfit. The band is highly secretive in nature and has kept their identities unknown. (hasitleaked.com)\n\n- - -\n\nGhost - Infestissumam 2013\n(Sonet)\n\n     1. Infestissumam\n     2.
