For the record, which showed off his 1970s &quot;obsession&quot; with soul music, Bowie let go of the influences he had drawn from in the past, replacing them with sounds from &quot;local dance halls&quot;, which, at the time, were blaring with &quot;lush strings, sliding hi-hat whispers, and swanky R&amp;B rhythms of Philadelphia Soul&quot;. Bowie is quoted describing the album as &quot;the squashed remains of ethnic music as it survives in the age of Muzak rock, written and sung by a white limey&quot;. Because of the strong influence of black music on the album, Bowie used the term &quot;plastic soul&quot; (originally coined by an unknown black musician in the 1960s) to describe the sound of Young Americans.[9] Although Bowie was an English musician bringing up touchy American issues, the album was still very successful in the United States; the album itself reached the top ten in the US, with the song &quot;Fame&quot; hitting the number-one spot the same year the album was released.\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC, tracks+.cue\n\nTracklist:\n1 Young Americans (5:10)\n2 Win (4:44)\n3 Fascination (5:43)\n4 Right\n5 Somebody Up There Likes Me (6:30)\n6 Across The Universe (4:30)\n7 Can You Hear Me (5:04)\n8 Fame (4:12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9c7da1a21f823a0c8aac9599a7ee7a8cab2b23","amp;dn":"%281975%29+David+Bowie+-+Young+Americans+%282009+Japan+SHM-CD%29+%5BFLAC%2B.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9c7da1a21f823a0c8aac9599a7ee7a8cab2b23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,156,125,161,162,31,130,58,12,138,172,149,153,167,238,122,140,171,43,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
