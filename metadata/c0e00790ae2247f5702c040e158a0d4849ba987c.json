Democracy Now!'s War and Peace Report provides the audience with access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition, Democracy Now! hosts real debatesâ€“debates between people who substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the other.\r\n\r\nDemocracy Now!\r\nMonday, May 09, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport independent news! \nhttp://www.democracynow.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0e00790ae2247f5702c040e158a0d4849ba987c","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now%21+2016-05-09+-+Farm+Workers+Struggle+%2B..","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0e00790ae2247f5702c040e158a0d4849ba987c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,224,7,144,174,34,71,245,112,44,4,14,21,138,13,72,73,186,152,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
