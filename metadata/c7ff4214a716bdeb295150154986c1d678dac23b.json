Now, Captain John Naiser and his crew spearhead a diplomat mission to the alien homeworld, hoping to ease them into the galactic mainstream.\n\nBut with hundreds of others hoping to influence and shape the developing alien culture, and all hell threatening to break loose as human ideals meet alien realities, events on Vesy might just mark the start of a new interstellar conflict ...\n\n... And a civil war that will tear the human sphere apart. \n\n\nRead by Ralph Lister\nFormat: M4B\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nLength: 12 hrs and 37 mins\nSeries: Ark Royal, Book 5\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:07-21-15\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ff4214a716bdeb295150154986c1d678dac23b","amp;dn":"Christopher+Nuttall+-+A+Savage+War+Of+Peace+%28Warspite+%232%2C+Ark+Ro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ff4214a716bdeb295150154986c1d678dac23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,255,66,20,167,22,189,235,41,81,80,21,73,134,193,214,120,218,194,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
