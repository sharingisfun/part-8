MoRE CoMING SooN. ENJoY!\n\n\n\nPart of the never-ending World Music Library from King Records, \nthis compilation of Tanzanian music is surprisingly well put \ntogether (as opposed to some others in the series). Multiple \nsong forms are represented, from a collection of children's \nsongs to instrumental virtuosity on three forms of the marimba, \nnative stringed instruments, and vocals. The main highlights on \nthe album are most likely the amazing work done on the marimbas, \nin both the mkwaju rhythms played early on in the album, and \nespecially the marimba duet on track 14. The virtuosity that can \nbe displayed with the instrument is almost enough to put jazz \npianists to shame. Fans of African traditional (not soukous, etc.) \nmusic should definitely check out this album. \n~ Adam Greenberg, All Music Guide\n\n\nCreditsName:                   Credits:\nBringit Makannga Nganza        Vocals, Zeze Kamba Moja\nChrispini Yanuka               Vocals, Marimba Ya Sanduku\nHukwe Zawose                   Vocals, Zeze Kamba Kumi, ?\nMabele Wegeru                  Lilandi, ?\nOmari Kipozi                   Marimba Ya Sanduku, ?\nWaeremma Wasiegga              Conductor\n\n\nAlbum Details:\nTitle: Music of Tanzania\nArtist: Various Artists\nRelease Date: 1/1993\nLabel: World Music Library\nAlbum Type(s): Various artists collection\nGenre: World\nStyle: African Folk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f4a09d824e39ef2de2aaefc83f516336df7d77","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Music+of+Tanzania","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f4a09d824e39ef2de2aaefc83f516336df7d77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,244,160,157,130,78,57,239,45,226,170,239,200,63,81,99,54,223,125,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
