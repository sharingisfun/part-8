I could just post a link to the place I found it on... except... I have no damn clue where I found it.\n\nSo first things first... \nI'd like to thank people from Reloaded team (and I do realize you guys hate P2P) And I know you won't read it... doesn't matter... you guys are a brilliant bunch and the least I can do is say a simple fucking thank you.\n\nSo again... Thank you.\n\nWhat else...\n\nI have a really shitty upload speed (can't afford a better one) i can only up at 50-60 KB and this one isn't a small file. (it's like 1.5 Gigs). So please, if it's not too much to ask seed the fucking thing.\n\nThere's a chance I fucked something up, so let me know.\n\nI threw in a reloaded crack and a coalesced that will unlock all the bonus stuff. For your convenience I enigmatically called it &quot;thrown In&quot; folder. (bet you wouldn't crack that code) :). Oh I think that this coalesced will also unlock the stripper/dancer outfit.\n\n\nIf anyone will post &quot;Seed&quot;... I'll fucking find you and bitch slap you like a little fuck you obviously are. (just realized that I'm inviting whole bunch of ppl to ironically post &quot;seed&quot; Which is kind of funny when used sarcastically ):)\n\n\nI didn't notice any change so don't ask me what this update does.\nThere's a chance you will not be able to get through some DLC moments, I have found three moments (both terminals in From ashes, trying to land on the planet searching for doc in leviathan, and going by a pod in Omega).\nA fix is simple... Delete the &quot;Bioware&quot; folder, save your saves, than just move your saves back once the game create new folder. I think you gotta run the game once you delete bioware folder. I couldn't figure out where the code hides, but it is definitely in your documents.\n\nif you got a firefight DLC you will see two missing weapon graphics... to fix that you need a multiplayer DLC (Devs must have fucked up)... What was it called... let me check...\n\n[Quote]\np9kVs7-c17 \t\n  Post subject: Re: Mass Effect 3 ALL-DLC crack possiblities?   \nPosted: Tuesday, 14 Aug 2012, 01:59   \n\nAdvanced forumer Ã¢â€¢Â¨ÃƒÂ¹Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€“â€˜Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€“â€œÃ¢â€¢Â¤ÃƒÂ¼Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€¢Â¡Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€â€šÃ¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€Â¤Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€“â€˜Ã¢â€¢Â¤ÃƒÂ©Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€“â€˜Ã¢â€¢Â¨Ã¢â€¢Â£\n \n\nJoined: Sunday, 23 Mar 2008, 17:47\nPosts: 225 \tI have fixed it...\nI've set them to private because, \ngets many times Bad Gateway or MySQL errors on my browsers.\n\nOh and if you want insert a F12 binding to unlock Firefight DLC Weapons,\nI've tested that today on afternoon!\nMy modified DLC Coalesced.bin hasn't working!\n\nbut i hope you will have luck\n\nEDIT:\nTo solve the problem with the two missing weapons....\ninstall Resurgence and Rebellion Multiplayer-DLC's![/quote]\n\n\nI think I got it off of some Russian site (got great memory... short though) :)\n\n\n\n\nI think that's it I probably forgot something, but hey [fake Italian accent]Wacha' gonna' do[/fake italian accent]\n So be good now \nAnd take care\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62aa5c0af192915ec94cb5e87b8ae8849f30f3c","amp;dn":"Mass.Effect.Update.v1.04.5427.111-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62aa5c0af192915ec94cb5e87b8ae8849f30f3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,42,165,192,175,25,41,21,236,148,203,94,135,184,174,136,73,243,15,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
