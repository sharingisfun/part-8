The band formed in 2007, and they have been recognized from 2009 with the release of their debut album 'I' (one) via Candlelight Records.\n\nContaining elements of progressive, death, thrash and symphonic metal, Xerath's music is characterized by the mix of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, with orchestral and symphonic elements. Xerath cite their influences as Strapping Young Lad, Dimmu Borgir, and Opeth as well as film score composition and an eclectic mix of other bands and genres.\n\nXerath was formed in 2007 by guitarist Andy Phillips, drummer Michael Pitman and Bassist / Guitarist Owain Williams. Xerath was originally started as an experiment to combine Film score style composition with syncopated guitar rhythms and crushing metal grooves. In 2007, Xerath won the Terrorizer Magazine best unsigned band competition based on reader votes. In early 2008, Xerath signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records, best known for acts such as Emperor and Opeth. Xerath released their debut CD entitled I (One) in May 2009. Their second album II (Two) was released on May 3, 2011.\n\nXerath made their first notable live performance at Bloodstock Open Air festival in the UK.\nConor McGouran - Guitars\nMichael Pitman - Drums\nRichard Thomson - Vocals\nChristopher Clark - Bass\n\n01. 2053\n02.
