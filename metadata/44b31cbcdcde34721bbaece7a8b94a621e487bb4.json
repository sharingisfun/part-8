The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.\n\nMorris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s released from prison after thirty-five years.\n\nNot since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€for good, for bad, forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b31cbcdcde34721bbaece7a8b94a621e487bb4","amp;dn":"Finders+Keepers+-+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b31cbcdcde34721bbaece7a8b94a621e487bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,179,28,188,220,222,52,114,27,186,236,231,168,185,74,98,30,72,123,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
