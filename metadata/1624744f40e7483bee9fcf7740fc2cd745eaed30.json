The material represented here -- all but one of these tracks were recorded for the Vocalion label -- features accompaniment by guitarist Scrapper Blackwell on all but one selection, and Josh White on a handful as well. Carr's material here ranges from the classic piano blues of the era that spawned Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith to vaudeville and hokum tunes made popular by artists like Tampa Red and Georgia Tom. Carr's voice is the haunting thing here; it's higher and very clear, sweet almost, as evidenced by most of these sides. But there was an edge, too; one that belied a kind of pathos underneath even the most cheery material -- check &quot;Mean Mistreater Blues&quot; or &quot;Bread Baker.&quot; But the darker material such as &quot;Suicide Blues&quot; (one of six previously unissued performances), &quot;Straight Alky Blues,&quot; or &quot;Shinin' Pistol,&quot; is strange and eerie given Carr's smooth approach. Carr may not be the most well-known bluesman of the era, but his contribution is profound and lasting. This collection puts to shame almost all others with the exception of the multi-volume complete recordings on Document. But given the fact that these sides are wonderfully remastered, and 40 tracks are enough for virtually anybody but the hardest core blues punter, this is the set to have. \n\nRecording information: Chicago, IL (06/19/1928-02/25/1935); Indianapolis, IN (06/19/1928-02/25/1935); New York, NY (06/19/1928-02/25/1935); St. Louis, MO (06/19/1928-02/25/1935).\n\nLeroy Carr (vocals, piano); Leroy Carr; Josh White (guitar); Scrapper Blackwell (guitar).\n\n\nAlbum: Whiskey Is My Habit, Women Is All I Crave: The Best Of Leroy Carr (Disc 1) \nBitrate: 320K/s \nTime: 61:41 \nSize: 145.5 MB \nLabel: Columbia/Legacy\nStyles: Piano blues\nYear: 2004 \n\n[3:03] 1.
