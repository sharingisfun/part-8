That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s changed since the last Detective Torrent? The last one ended at 867, now 877 plus a new annual. About 3 dozen old issues have been replaced with better ones, most from the 1990s. These were early scans when smaller file sizes were the norm since hard drive space was much more expensive. Progress is probably going to be slow from now on for the really old issues, 1930s-1950s many of which have only fiche scans as many of them those that are left to do are expensive.\n\n\tIf you catch any errors or incomplete issues (story pages missing), let me know. These are not all ctc scans, not that some of you even care about that, but the majority are.\n\nNo BATMAN!  It was the dim times before the Batman made &quot;Detective Comics&quot; or &quot;DC&quot; synonymous with the publisher. So much so they started putting DC on all their covers and finally changed the company name to DC. If not for Batman they might be &quot;AC&quot; or just &quot;National Periodical Publications&quot; as I knew them as a kid.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/9310/detectivecomics001.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/9310/detectivecomics001.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBatman BEGINS. Only 11 episodes of the PURE batman before Robin is added, who was the BEST of the sidekicks, hangers on, etc but I wish it never happened. (don't get me started about &quot;Sandy&quot; (Sandman), &quot;Doiby Dickles&quot; (Green Lantern), Those 3 idiots who kept appearing in Flash (Jay Garrick) stories etc). Fortunately Superman never had SuperRobin.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img229.imageshack.us/img229/6561/detectivecomics027.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img229.imageshack.us/img229/6561/detectivecomics027.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYeah, here he is. Robin Red Breast. Robin Yellow Cape, Robin Green Hot Pants. Robin Elf Boots. Robin who destroyed the dark creature of the night, striking fear into the hearts of criminals! Robin the chirping creature of the day. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img864.imageshack.us/img864/2032/detective038robini.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img864.imageshack.us/img864/2032/detective038robini.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe new look. (now the really old look) I hate the new look. Sure put a bright yellow circle on the dark knight's chest.  It's just wrong. I don't care how you think it looka, It does not fit the image. Not to mention you might as well go all the way and paint a couple more circles around it to complete the target on Batman's chest. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe they brought that circle back after they took it away. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4438/detective327newlook.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/4438/detective327newlook.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBatman takes a break after so many years of headlining DC. The rumors of his demise were greatly exaggerated of course. Just another gimmick. Bruce Wayne had to return.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/6056/detective853batbreak.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/6056/detective853batbreak.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBatwoman Begins.\nWell I can't say I was happy to see this change. DC means Detective Comics and they screwed with it. Fortunately it was temporary but it still broke Batman's 827 issues streak. On the other hand since I don't read anything published after about 1973 I shouldn't care right? But I do. Of course very soon it seems they will end volume one and restart with Detective v2 001. That's akin to blasphemy. You can tell me it's just a number. You can  say it doesn't change what's in it.  You can give me a dozen logical reasons why I should not care. I still do. It's emotional thinking - logic is irrelevant. I wanted to live to see issue 1000 of Action, Detective, Batman and Superman. Sure they went back to the old numbers after v2 of Superman and probably will this time, but that just makes a further mockery of the whole thing. It's just sad. Did they learn nothing from Marvel's abortive renumbering? Maybe they are right and it will help sales. What would really help sales is if they could get themselves back in drugstores and grocery stores and wherever magazines are sold, like in the old days. I am of course, an expert on this and hundreds of other topics I now nothing about.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img229.imageshack.us/img229/4898/detectivecomics854.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img229.imageshack.us/img229/4898/detectivecomics854.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Batwoman ends and Batman returns &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1926/detective863batwoamnlas.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1926/detective863batwoamnlas.jpg&lt;/a&gt; http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/2370/detective864batmanback.jpg\n\n\nThis is in effect my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFifth Annual Detective TorrentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Detective has a special place for me as it either the first or second torrent I ever did was a fill post for someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Detective torrent on Demonoid Summer of 2006. I HAD to give people the wonderful old stories. (Both those torrents died when Demonoid went away from November 2007-Spring 2008). About a year and a half after my first upload, in December 2007 I posted a complete (for then) Detective torrent. All four of the past ones are still alive\n\n I'd like to kill them, so people  find this new one instead, but I can't since I have no way of telling those downloading them to get the newer one. This will probably be the last. I almost waited till v2 was started so this would be the complete run of v1, but it's just to sad. Let this be posted while v1 is still alive!\n\n Thank you scanners, especially the following. Flattermann-231 of 867 monthly series 236 issues say flatterman (some being joint efforts such as flattermann-mazen scans). Another 18 are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnardermannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a collaboration between Flatterman and Snard. Other fine scans are present from Cimmerian32,  BlueJeff, GCPDGuy (a prolific Bat-Scanner who alas, is not a cover to cover guy) quite a few without names or tags, and a host of o DCP, SCP and a few Minutemen scanners. (Minutemen donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t normally do CTC scans, so I rarely have them, as I prefer cover to cover). Thank you all most heartily for your work.\n\n          A number of the early issues are from microfiche and not paper scans. Many are marked but probably not all. The quality varies. Readability is controversial. I am able to read the worst of them, others declare them worthless and don't even include them in torrents. I give you these and the reprints that have been scanned, trying to do the best I can.\n\n584 of the monthly series are marked ctc (c2c for normal people - I just started out using ctc before I knew it was non-standard and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m too stubborn to change). A great many of the rest I have not checked a page count for so there may be some more.\n\nI did my best to find as many larger scans as I could for any scan that came in under 10mb. The smallest 33 are still under 7mb (was 40 last august). 131 are still under 10mb.  I expect to see a lot of these replaced in the next year or two.\n There was a long run of issues from the 1980s and 90s where a lot of the scans were story only and smallfor that.  These were mostly scanned early in the days of scanning. Scanners make larger files these days and many have been rescanned. A typical recent DCP or SCP scan is 15-20mb for cover to cover.\n\nToday's offering: Detective Comics\n\nEnjoy! \n\n\nDetective Comics 001-877 (1937-2011)\n \nDetective Comics 1,000,000 (09-1998)\n\nDetective Comics Zero ctc (10-1994)\n\nDetective Comics Annuals 01-12 (1988-2011)\n\n127 Early Detective Comics reprints (119 are Batman only).

However, after a short Zsasz story, that book made the OYL jump under James Robinson and then Paul Dini.  Whatever this project was, it never came about, and we're left with some gorgeous pages by Sienkiewicz.\n\nItem two (Unpublished Man-Bat art-Brian Stelfreeze) is described by the source for that\nChuck Dixon saved what he believed to be his finest work during his Detective Comics run for what he had planned to be his last story, a two-parter centering on Man-Bat.  A new psychotherapist comes to work at Arkham, and after detailed psychological evaluations of each inmate, she determines that the key to solving Gotham's supercrime problem is capturing Batman.  However, she mistakenly captures Man-Bat, and chaos at Arkham ensues.\nThe story was pushed back over and over again to make room for Cataclysm, and then The Road to No Man's Land, and then No Man's Land, until Dixon wasn't even writing the book anymore.  It was briefly kicked around as a possible Prestige one-shot, but that also fell through.  Dixon's dream artist for the project, Brian Stelfreeze, finished some simple layout drawings (each page done on a quarter-sheet of typing paper!) and also finished pencilling three pages.
