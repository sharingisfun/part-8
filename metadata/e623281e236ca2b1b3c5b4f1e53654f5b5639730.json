More info? OK.\n\n\nBonkers is a Happy Hardcore CD serie.\n\nNo junk files. (maybe some pic's only)\n\nAll albums have split tracks, trakcnumbers and full name.\n\n\nThe torrent content is taken from the Internet, I release it in a somewhat perfect compilation, compared to the other one this is ace. If you find any errors please tell. I have edited a lot to make this possible and will happily correct errors for a future Internet with less garbage.\n\nIn my dreams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e623281e236ca2b1b3c5b4f1e53654f5b5639730","amp;dn":"_Bonkers+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e623281e236ca2b1b3c5b4f1e53654f5b5639730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,35,40,30,35,108,162,177,179,197,180,241,229,54,84,245,181,99,151,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
