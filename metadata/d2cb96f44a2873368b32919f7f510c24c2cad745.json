ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still not 100% as we want it, but fixing it completely will require bigger changes that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve planned for Minecraft 1.5.\n3.Fixed tooltip width for renamed items\n4.Added a number of sound events, but the sound effects are not added yet\n5.Server ping will now tell if the server and client have mismatching protocol versions\n6.Updated translation files\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS \n\n\nWindows- \n\n1.
