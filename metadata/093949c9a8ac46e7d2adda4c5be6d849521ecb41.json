Kate Haywood, a simple musician in the employ of a princess, will find herself involved in games of crowns as she sets out to solve the murder of the queenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s envoy....\n\nEngland is in tumult under the rule of Queen Mary and her Spanish husband. Confined to house arrest at Hatfield House, young Princess Elizabeth is the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest hope. Far from court intrigues, Elizabeth finds solace in simple things: the quiet countryside and peaceful recreation, including the melodies of her chief musician and his daughter, Kate Haywood.\n\nBut Kate will prove herself most valuable when an envoy of the queenÃ¢â‚¬â€sent to flush out heretics in the princessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s householdÃ¢â‚¬â€is found dead on the grounds of Hatfield. Acting as ElizabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes and ears, Kate is sent out on the trail of a killer whose mission could destroy her family, friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€and the future of England.\n\n**\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAmanda Carmack is a pseudonym for a multipublished author.
