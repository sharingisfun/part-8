Translated by Samuel Shirley; edited, with Introductions, by Michael L. Morgan.\n\nISBN: 9780872206205 | 992 pages | PDF\n\nThe only complete edition in English of Baruch Spinoza's works, this volume features Samuel ShirleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preeminent translations, distinguished at once by the lucidity and fluency with which they convey the flavor and meaning of SpinozaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original texts. Michael L. Morgan provides a general introduction that places Spinoza in Western philosophy and culture and sketches the philosophical, scientific, religious, moral and political dimensions of Spinoza's thought. Morgan's brief introductions to each work give a succinct historical, biographical, and philosophical overview. A chronology and index are included.\n\nContents\n\n* Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect\n* Short Treatise on Man, God, and His Well-Being\n* Principles of Cartesian Philosophy and Metaphysical Thoughts\n* Ethics\n* Theological-Political Treatise\n* Hebrew Grammar\n* Political Treatise\n* The Letters\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;This elegant volume has been produced to a very high standard, is easy to handle, affordably priced, and, most importantly, renders Spinoza accurately into clear and graceful English. It will undoubtedly become an indispensable tool for all serious readers of Spinoza. . . . The supporting editorial material of this volume is. . . judicious and reliable. The eight-page Introduction offers a succinct interpretive overview of Spinoza's system that will be thought-provoking for specialists, while also basic enough to be accessible to novice Spinozists. Morgan also provides a very useful chronology of Spinoza's life, a brief introduction to each work, and a light apparatus of footnotes.&quot; -- Adam Sutcliffe, The Jewish Quarterly Review\n\n&quot;Samuel Shirley's translations are fluent, eminently readable, and responsive to current research. Where a particular passage is difficult or obscure, Shirley never attempts to interpose himself between the reader and Spinoza, nor to side with one or another competing school of thought or interpretation. That makes his translations not just an ideal introduction for the reader new to Spinoza, but also a trustworthy source of insight for the more advanced reader.&quot; -- Lee Rice, Marquette University\n\n&quot;A truly marvelous accomplishment. . . Shirley is undoubtedly the most significant translator of Spinoza's writings into English. His translations have the unique ability to integrate accuracy, lucidity, and facility of expression that is unparalleled by other translators of Spinoza.&quot; -- Douglas Den Uyl, Bellarmine College\n\n&quot;This complete set of SpinozaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings -- translated in lucid, readable English -- is an invaluable tool for those new to Spinoza studies as well as the professional scholar.&quot; -- Steven Barbone, San Diego State University\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa0e07aafce874cc0d05ad33084967e2bbd1e86","amp;dn":"Baruch+Spinoza+-+Complete+Works+%28Hackett%2C+2002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faa0e07aafce874cc0d05ad33084967e2bbd1e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,160,224,122,175,206,135,76,192,208,90,211,48,132,150,126,43,189,30,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
