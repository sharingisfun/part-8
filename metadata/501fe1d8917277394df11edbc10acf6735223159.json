The title comes from a song from their 1995 self-titled debut album.\n\nThe standard-edition album contains 17 popular songs from the band's discography and Folds' subsequent solo career, as well as the new Ben Folds Five single &quot;House&quot;, which debuted on the website for the NBC competition show The Sing Off, of which Folds is a judge.\n\nAn expanded edition includes 43 additional tracks over three discs, including two more new songs from Ben Folds Five recorded in 2011. Folds also made available through his website the additional album Fifty-Five Vault, a 56-track collection of rarities. A five-track sampler from this album, Free Folds Five, was included with digital copies of The Best Imitation of Myself.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Imitation_of_Myself:_A_Retrospective&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Imitation_of_Myself:_A_Retrospective&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
