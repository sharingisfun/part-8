In THE CRASH OF 2016, Thom Hartmann argues that the facade of our once-great United States will soon disintegrate to reveal the rotting core where corporate and billionaire power and greed have replaced democratic infrastructure and governance. Our once-enlightened political and economic systems have been manipulated to ensure the success of only a fraction of the population at the expense of the rest of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad71e37098c6b834117299e1aadc1f43170529a","amp;dn":"Thom+Hartmann+-+The+Crash+of+2016+-+The+Plot+to+Destroy+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad71e37098c6b834117299e1aadc1f43170529a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,215,30,55,9,140,107,131,65,23,41,158,26,173,193,244,49,112,82,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
