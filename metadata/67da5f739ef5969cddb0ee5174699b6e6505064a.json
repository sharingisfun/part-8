But anyways, back to MJ, it is a great album. The foundation of Live, the beginning of it all. The whole album preached peace and love without being preachy. The Beauty of Gray is one of the best i think. The excellent lyrics and music make a unique sound, and provide the base that Live needed to launch themselves into their musical career. There are some really ingenious lyrics in here. This is an album everyone should have.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67da5f739ef5969cddb0ee5174699b6e6505064a","amp;dn":"Live+-+Mental+Jewelry+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67da5f739ef5969cddb0ee5174699b6e6505064a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,218,95,115,158,245,150,156,221,176,238,81,116,105,155,110,101,5,6,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
