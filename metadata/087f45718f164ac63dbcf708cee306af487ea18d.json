First going under the name Soul Magician, the band released a single titled &quot;Inside a Healing Mind&quot; in 2002, followed by the &quot;No Other Life Is Attractive,&quot; the first release as Thirteen Senses. &quot;Falls in the Dark&quot; surfaced a year later. The Invitation was available by September 2004 and reached number 14 on the U.K. charts upon its re-release. Cracking the singles chart were a handful of songs including &quot;Into the Fire,&quot; which was featured in several popular U.S television shows. The band toured Europe in 2005 before returning to the studio for Contact, appearing in April 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087f45718f164ac63dbcf708cee306af487ea18d","amp;dn":"Thirteen+Senses+-+A+Strange+Encounter+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087f45718f164ac63dbcf708cee306af487ea18d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,127,69,113,143,22,74,198,61,188,247,8,206,227,6,175,72,126,161,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
