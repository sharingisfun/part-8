Fire Protection Building Materials Handbook walks you through the challenging maze of choosing form the hundreds of commercially available materials used in buildings today and tells you which burn and /or are weakened during exposure to fire. It is the burning characteristics of materials, which usually allow fires to begin and propagate, and the degradation of materials that cause the most damage. Providing expert guidance every step of the way, Fire Protection Building Materials Handbook helps the architect, designers and fire protection engineers to design and maintain safer buildings while complying with international codes.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3e6e87151e8f9ff757bb6e7270608da45c6f15","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Building+Materials+for+Fire+Protection+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3e6e87151e8f9ff757bb6e7270608da45c6f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,62,110,135,21,30,143,159,247,87,187,110,114,112,96,141,164,92,111,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
