Nevertheless, The Best of Van Morrison is a cracker-jack compilation, tracing Van the Man from his days with Them, through his best-known tunes (&amp;quot;Brown-Eyed Girl,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Moondance,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Blue Money,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Wild Night&amp;quot;), to highlights from the '70s and '80s cult efforts, topped off by &amp;quot;Wonderful Remark,&amp;quot; a song first heard on the King of Comedy soundtrack. This collection makes Morrison's work seem a little more immediate and accessible than it usually is, but that's a blessing, since it provides a great summary of his hits and a nice introduction for the curious. Yes, it could have dug deeper into the catalog, but as a sampler, it can't be faulted. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1390d5dfb165750d703da06a8da77769513f41","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+The+Best+Of+Van+Morrison+and+covers+%40256","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1390d5dfb165750d703da06a8da77769513f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,19,144,213,223,177,101,117,13,112,61,160,106,141,167,119,105,81,63,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
