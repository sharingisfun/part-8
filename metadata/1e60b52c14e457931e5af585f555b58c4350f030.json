Hair, et. al provides an applications-oriented introduction to multivariate analysis for the non-statistician. By reducing heavy statistical research into fundamental concepts, the text explains to students how to understand and make use of the results of specific statistical techniques. In this seventh revision, the organization of the chapters has been greatly simplified. New chapters have been added on structural equations modeling, and all sections have been updated to reflect advances in technology, capability, and mathematical techniques.\nPreparing For a MV Analysis; Dependence Techniques; Interdependence Techniques; Moving Beyond the Basic Techniques\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e60b52c14e457931e5af585f555b58c4350f030","amp;dn":"Multivariate+Data+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e60b52c14e457931e5af585f555b58c4350f030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,96,181,44,20,228,87,147,30,90,245,133,245,85,181,140,67,80,240,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
