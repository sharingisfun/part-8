It debuted at number thirty-seven on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart selling 29,000 units in its opening week[2] and spawned the international hit single &quot;Breathe&quot;. The album did not share the domestic success of So Blu, selling only 228,000 copies in the U.S. and remaining so far uncertified by the Recording Industry Association of America. However, unlike Cantrell's debut album, Bittersweet managed to reach international markets, performing modestly in certain European nations.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] I Love You\n[02] Sleep In The Middle\n[03] Unhappy\n[04] Impatient - - - Blu Cantrell Featuring Lil Kim &amp; Fat Joe\n[05] Breathe (Rap Version) - - - Blu Cantrell Featuring Sean Paul\n[06] Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!)\n[07] Risk It All\n[08] Don't Wanna Say Goodbye\n[09] All You Had To Say\n[10] Happily Ever After\n[11] Holding On To Love\n[12] Swingin'\n[13] Let Her Go\n[14] Round Up - - - Blu Cantrell Featuring Lady May\n[15] Make Me Wanna Scream - - - Blu Cantrell Featuring Ian Lewis\n[16] No Place Like Home\n\nPlay Time - 01h:05m:11s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 159mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
