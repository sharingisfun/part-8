He was born in Dallas, Texas and is the son of singer, songwriter and drummer Doyle Bramhall, who had grown up as a close friend of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimmie Vaughan. At age 16, Doyle Bramhall II toured with Jimmie Vaughan's band, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, as second guitarist. Some of Doyle's influences include, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson, Donny Hathaway, Freddie King, Albert King, Jimmie Vaughan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Curtis Mayfield.\nIn 1992 Doyle formed Arc Angels with Charlie Sexton and Stevie Ray Vaughan's rhythm section of bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton (also known as Double Trouble). Doyle and Sexton were only able to work together for one album but it was well received, with several songs receiving heavy rock radio airplay. They went their own ways after the album but have gotten back together and have been playing shows as Arc Angels again in 2006 and 2007.\nDoyle released his self-titled debut album on the Geffen record label in 1996 with backing support from Wendy and Lisa (Bramhall is married to Wendy's sister, vocalist Susannah Melvoin). In later interviews, he stated his intent with that album to establish himself as more than just a guitar player.\nHe was later signed to RCA, and released his second album Jellycream in 1999. He appeared on Austin City Limits in an episode shared with Robert Cray that fall. The Jellycream album found its way into the hands of Eric Clapton, who took an interest in his music and included &quot;Marry You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot; in a collaborative album he was working on with B.B. King, released in 2000 as Riding With The King.[citation needed] Doyle also formed a new band, &quot;Doyle Bramhall II &amp; Smokestack,&quot; and recorded a new album produced by Benmont Tench of Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers fame. Released in 2001, Welcome marked a renewed focus on guitar.\nDoyle's recording relationship with Clapton continued to flourish, and he co-wrote &quot;Superman Inside&quot; for and played guitar on Eric's 2001 solo album, Reptile. He and Smokestack opened for Clapton on his 2001 world tour, and Doyle occasionally joined Eric on stage. By 2004, he was Clapton's second guitarist after Andy Fairweather-Low backed out of the tour. The 2004 tour was Clapton's effort at channeling his hero Robert Johnson and Doyle later admitted that he had never listened to Robert Johnson until getting the gig as Clapton's second guitarist. Doyle also appears with Eric in the 2004 CD/DVD release Sessions for Robert J.\nDoyle also played guitar on the 1999-2002 In the Flesh tour (captured on the In the Flesh Live album) by former Pink Floyd leader/bassist Roger Waters.\nPrevious to that, Doyle also played a much lower key role backing his wife Susannah Melvoin's (who also toured with Waters during the In the Flesh tour as a backing singer) twin sister Wendy Melvoin for her band Girl Bros., and more recently with Wendy and Lisa in the groups Pacifico and Funk Sway. Pacifico consisted of Wendy and Lisa, along with Doyle, Mike Elizondo and Abe Laboriel Jr., and several recordings from a small club tour have surfaced. Funk Sway ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Erykah Badu, Wendy and Lisa ?uestlove of The Roots, and Doyle, are featured in the music documentary Before the Music Dies.\nAs a session guitarist, he has worked with Me'shell NdegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ocello, Sheryl Crow and Susan Tedeschi. He also toured with Eric Clapton as part of his 2006/2007 world tour along with slide guitarist Derek Trucks and he performed at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival at Chicago's Toyota Park.\nOf his songwriting, Doyle has said that although the blues is one of his favorite genres, he finds that most of his attempts at bluesy songwriting end up sounding &quot;corny,&quot; and his songs always tend to have more of a rock feel.\nDoyle usually plays the Fender Stratocaster but will occasionally play some Gibson guitars, either playing on left-handed models or right-handed models upside-down. Doyle plays guitar left-handed but his guitars are strung as if to be played by a right-handed player. In other words, the low E string is at the bottom of his guitar, and the high string at the top. This fact and his unique playing style can be seen clearly in the &quot;In the Flesh: Live&quot; DVD footage.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8723251ff40cd4f27eedfb098e1f9b3b902a96","amp;dn":"Doyle+Bramhall+ll-4+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8723251ff40cd4f27eedfb098e1f9b3b902a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,135,35,37,31,244,12,212,242,126,237,251,9,142,31,155,59,144,42,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
