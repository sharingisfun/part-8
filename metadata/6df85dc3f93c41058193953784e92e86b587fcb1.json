Instead, Youssou infuses this CD with the flavours, the scents the rhythms of Egyptian traditional and orchestral music, creating a captivating percolation of North African textures that transport the listener through the sand storms of the northern Sahara to arrive in the oasesin sight of the pyramids. The music is thus more hypnotic and angular than his pop stuff, and it is refreshing not to hear an American or British voice breaking through. This is all this amazing Senegalese working with a sympathetic clique of like minded percusiionists, string and flute players and guitarists.\nIt is a Nonesuch recording, so the integrity of the natural sound is presented so purely that it is an aural wonder to listen to, and marks a significant departure from anything else he has done. The songs are a combination of prayers, &quot;Allah,&quot;, Epictatan morality injunctions &quot;Mahdiyu Laye,&quot; historical encomiums &quot;Baay Niasse&quot;, and wise entreaties designed to bring you to a place of peace &quot;Touba - Daru Salaam&quot;. They are in each case a reflection of Senegal's Sufi tradition, and Youssou treats them with respect and passion. He quotes the Sengalese patriot Mamadou Dia: &quot;Love, in Islam, is not intellectual, but visceral.&quot; and that is so much to how the subtlety in this collection is delivered. Youssou handled the production in Dakar and in Cairo, and the sympatico he evokes among the usicians works so seamlessly, they are as one throught each track. I think you'll find this CD is one of his most satisfying ever.\n-- amazon Top 500 reviewer\n\nTracks\n01- Allah\n02- Shukran Bamba\n03- Mahdiyu Laye\n04- Tijaniyya\n05- Baay Niasse\n06- Bamba The Poet\n07- Cheikh Ibra Fall\n08- Touba - Daru Salaam\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df85dc3f93c41058193953784e92e86b587fcb1","amp;dn":"Youssou+N%5C%27Dour+-+Egypt+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df85dc3f93c41058193953784e92e86b587fcb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,248,93,195,249,60,65,5,129,147,149,55,132,233,46,134,181,135,252,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
