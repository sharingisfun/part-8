Since 1995 guitarist Stefan ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œstersjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ has been the artistic director of the group. The ensemble consists of a pool of free-lance musicians and members from the different orchestras in the South of Sweden, many of them also being some of the most important soloists in new music in Sweden. Ensemble Ars Nova has more and more sought out a repertoire, which combines instrumental and electro-acoustic sound sources. One of the goals for the work of the ensemble is to explore forms of expression in which instrumental music and music technology can come together and enrich one another.\n\nAnother facet of the ensembleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work has been the collaboration with other arts, most recently manifested in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInterfaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ series of productions including the first Scandinavian performance of Samuel BeckettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s/Morton FeldmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWords and MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the world premiere of James ClarkeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collaboration with Swedish choreographer Efva Lilja in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe incredible youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (including the world premiere of ClarkeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKammersymphonieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and several premieres of works by Swedish composers.\n\nEnsemble Ars Nova has toured Sweden several times and participated in festivals for contemporary music in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Poland. Ensemble Ars Nova is regularly broadcasted by the Swedish radio and has recorded two CD's of its own (of which the second &quot;All Digital&quot; was nominated to a Swedish &quot;Grammy -96&quot; for best classical album) and participates on numerous other recordings.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b345f657a99dd5c19ced89c63d89b2213363b68f","amp;dn":"Ars+Nova+Ensemble%2C+De+Machaut%3A+Remede+de+Fortune","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b345f657a99dd5c19ced89c63d89b2213363b68f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,69,246,87,169,157,213,193,156,237,137,198,61,137,178,33,51,99,182,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
