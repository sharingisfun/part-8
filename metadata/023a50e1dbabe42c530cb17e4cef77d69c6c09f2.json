Goulding collaborated with several producers on the album, including Starsmith, Fraser T Smith, Frankmusik, Richard &quot;Biff&quot; Stannard, Ash Howes, Liam Howe, Fred Falke and Mumford &amp; Sons' Ben Lovett. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Goulding's electronic edge, while less favourable reviews felt the sound was generic. Lights debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 36,854 copies. In North America, the album charted at number twenty-one in the United States and number sixty-six in Canada. It spawned four singles: &quot;Under the Sheets&quot;, &quot;Starry Eyed&quot;, &quot;Guns and Horses&quot; and &quot;The Writer&quot;.  The album was re-released on 29 November 2010 as Bright Lights, including six brand-new tracks. It produced two additional singles, those being a cover of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Lights&quot;, which became Goulding's biggest hit to date in the UK and US, respectively. Following the re-release, the album saw a surge in sales in both the UK and Ireland. On 8 March 2011, the album was released in the United States featuring three songs that were previously not available on the original version, but were included on the Bright Lights reissue.\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Guns And Horses\n[02] Starry Eyed\n[03] This Love (Will Be Your Downfall)\n[04] Under The Sheets\n[05] The Writer\n[06] Every Time You Go\n[07] Wish I Stayed\n[08] Your Biggest Mistake\n[09] I'll Hold My Breath\n[10] Salt Skin\n[11] Lights\n[12] Human\n[13] Little Dreams\n[14] Home\n[15] Animal\n[16] Believe Me\n[17] Your Song\n\n\tCD Play Time - 01h:02m:10s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 448mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
