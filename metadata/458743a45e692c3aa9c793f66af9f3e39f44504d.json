While Einstein frequently shared his observations on science, politics, philosophy, and religion in his correspondence with Solovine, he was just as likely to express his feelings about everyday lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€his health and the effects of aging and his experiences in the various places where he settled and visited in his long career. The letters are both funny and frank, and taken together, reflect the changesÃ¢â‚¬â€large and smallÃ¢â‚¬â€that took place over a half century and in the remarkable life of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost scientist. Published in English alongside the German text and accompanied by facsimile copies of the original letters, the collected Letters to Solovine offers scholar and interested reader alike unprecedented access to the personal life of Albert Einstein. This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features a new introduction by Neil Berger and an illustrated biography of Albert Einstein, which includes rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Men are even more susceptible to suggestion than horses, and each period is dominated by a mood, with the result that most men fail to see the tyrant who rules over them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Albert Einstein, Princeton, April 10, 1938 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:458743a45e692c3aa9c793f66af9f3e39f44504d","amp;dn":"Letters+to+Solovine+1906-1955+by+Albert+Einstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"458743a45e692c3aa9c793f66af9f3e39f44504d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,135,67,164,94,105,44,58,169,199,147,246,106,249,243,227,159,68,80,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
