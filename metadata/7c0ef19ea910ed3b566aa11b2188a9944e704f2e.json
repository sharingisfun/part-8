Before she walks down the aisle, Jordan and her best friends, Claire (Adrienne Frantz) and Jessica (Daphnee Duplaix), head to Vegas for a bachelorette party. Determined to get Jordan to loosen up, Claire steers the girls to the hottest nightclub for a few drinks and some fun, because what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right? But when Jordan wakes up the next morning unable to recall the night before, she panics when she finds sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in movie star Matt's (Ethan Erickson) hotel suite with a gigantic diamond on her finger and a marriage certificate lying nearby. Before Jordan can have the marriage annulled and put this nightmare behind her, the impromptu wedding explodes into a publicity stunt fueled by MattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s manager Eric (Bruce Nozick) to promote his latest movie. With her wedding day approaching, Jordan finds herself more confused than ever when she starts falling in love with the movie star sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s married to instead of the fiancÃƒÂ© she thought was her perfect match.\n\n\nCast:\n\nKellie Martin ...
