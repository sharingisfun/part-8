Civ II, is a turn-based strategy computer \ngame designed by Brian Reynolds, Douglas Caspian-Kaufman and Jeff Briggs. \nAlthough it is a sequel to Sid Meier's Civilization, neither Sid Meier nor \nBruce Shelley were involved in its development. Civilization II was first \nreleased in 1996 for the PC and later ported to the Sony PlayStation.\n\nIn 2002 Atari re-released the game for newer operating systems, such as Windows \nMe and Windows XP. The Multiplayer Gold Edition was included in the Civilization\nChronicles box set released in 2006. Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition, \nbesides possessing multiplayer functionality also includes every Civilization II \nexpansion and many additional scenareos.\n\nThis is a new Release of Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition. While the \noriginal release and many other releases did contain all the necessary files for \na clean install of Civilization II: Multiplayer Gold Edition, they were flawed \nby a critical Vista installation and playability problems, stability issues, \naudio-video problems, and poor documentation. By converting the content to a \nportable format, providing working cracks and better documentation, and including \nthe Official and Unofficial  patches, these issues have been resolved. It is \nnote worthy that this release is the &quot;full&quot; release in contrast to the &quot;thin&quot;\nrelease, and as such it has had all audio and video files included regardless of\nnecessity.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your \ncomputer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe Federation recycled an unlisted crack for this game as Civilization II: \nMultiplayer Gold Edition requires a knowledge of archaic cracking which predates \nall Federation members. \n.V.\nI am ZKZ. \nI am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. \nProps to the scene.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Civilization II - Multiplayer Gold Edition.rar&quot; file to a \ndirectory of your choice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by \ndefault this is the &quot;Civilization II - Multiplayer Gold Edition&quot; directory). \n\n(2.) Double-click of the &quot;CIVILIZATION II - SCENARIOS PATCH.EXE&quot; if scenareo\nfunctionality is desired. Double-click on the &quot;CIVILIZATION II - MULTIPLAYER \nGOLD EDITION&quot; binary/executable.\n\nNote: This release is portable and therefore the binaries/executables within \nmake no changes to the game/system files which are already updated, modded, \nand cracked.\n\nNote: The official manuals, and covers are located in the &quot;.EXTRAS&quot; directory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue).

Once they have a clean version working, this \nCrack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work \nthere is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiablo - Ultimate UPD*\t \t        |Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\n4260899\t\t\t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\n                                        |\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)   |4236344\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHalf-Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPD*        |Far Cry - A-C LAN Co-op FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n4262500/\t\t\t\t|4268119/\n\t\t\t\t\nMass Effect - Portable FINAL*\t\t|Quake 2 - Co-op UPD*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n4274655/\t\t\t\t|4363733/\n\nDiablo 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\t\t|Civilization 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - Pending\n4363727/\t\t\t\t|\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t    Scene Requests/Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTO ALL - .
