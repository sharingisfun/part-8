As Patrick Dennis' plucky and resilient Auntie Mame, Ball's low-pitched, growling moan of a voice (a spine-chilling reminder of the sound of Linda Blair's demon-possession in The Exorcist) and her gaudy and lumbering fashion-horse gait turns Mame into an elderly cross-dresser. In this guise, Mame rehashes the plot from Dennis's novel and the previous non-musical Rosalind Russell film. During the Depression era 1930s, she enrolls her nephew into a liberal private school, tries a turn in show business (with the help of her friend Vera [Beatrice Arthur]), and marries a well-to-do Southern planter (Robert Preston). After her husband's death, Mame concerns herself with her now grown-up nephew, his girlfriend, and the girlfriend's intolerant parents.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071803/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071803/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector: Gene Saks \n\n\n\n\n\n\tLucille Ball\t... \tMame Dennis\n\n\tBea Arthur\t... \tVera Charles\n\tRobert Preston\t... \tBeauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside\n\n\tBruce Davison\t... \tThe Older Patrick\n\tKirby Furlong\t... \tYoung Patrick\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:11:16\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x360   16:9\nCodec : DivX 5\nFPS : 30,00\nBitRate : 792 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,12 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816ffe9b08aaf72c58704a212e28c7363db52b66","amp;dn":"Mame+%281974%29+Lucille+Ball+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816ffe9b08aaf72c58704a212e28c7363db52b66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,111,254,155,8,170,247,44,88,112,74,33,46,40,199,54,61,181,43,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
