His biographer, Francis Nevins Jr., rated Woolrich the fourth best crime writer of his day, behind only Dashiell Hammett, Erle Stanley Gardner, and Raymond Chandler. A check of film titles reveals that more film noir screenplays were adapted from works by Woolrich than any other crime novelist, and many of his stories were adapted during the 1940s for Suspense and other dramatic radio programs.\n\nNovels:\nA Young Man's Heart\nBlack Alibi\nBlack Angel\nBlack Curtain\nI Married A Dead Man\nInto The Night\nMarihuana\nNight Has a Thousand Eyes\nPhantom Lady\nRear Window (aka It Had to be Murder)\nRendezvous in Black\nSavage Bride\nThe Bride Wore Black\nWaltz into Darkness\n\nShort Stories and Short Story Collections:\nAnd So To Death\nAngel Face\nAngels Of Darkness\nDancing Detective\nDarkness at Dawn\nFor the Rest of Her Life\nFour Novellas of Fear\nHotel Room\nIt Only Takes a Minute to Die\nLove and Night\nNightwebs\nThe Dilemma of the Dead Lady\nThree O'Clock\nTwo Murders, One Crime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706164dfc1670ca221be775405821ebdd95c0414","amp;dn":"Cornell+Woolrich+-+Noir+Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706164dfc1670ca221be775405821ebdd95c0414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,97,100,223,193,103,12,162,33,190,119,84,5,130,30,189,217,92,4,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
