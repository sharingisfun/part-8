A follow up to Tori's critically acclaimed studio album, Abnormally Attracted to Sin, Midwinter Graces will find Tori reworking and expanding on classic carols as well as developing some of her very own seasonal tracks. Midwinter Graces is an album that has been in the making for the past 40 years. Raised in the Baltimore area under the watchful eye of her Methodist minister father, Tori grew up playing holiday carols at Sunday services and Christmas Day celebrations in her father's church. These were the songs that gave a young Tori her first taste of music, and now almost 40 years later Tori gets her own chance to reimagine classics like &quot;What Child, Nowell&quot; and &quot;Star of Wonder.&quot; Tori will also add her own bittersweet bliss to the season with original tracks like &quot;Pink and Glitter&quot; and &quot;Our New Year.&quot;\n\n\nMidwinter Graces\n01 What Child, Nowell.mp3\n02 Star Of Wonder.mp3\n03 A Silent Night With You.mp3\n04 Candle _ Coventry Carol.mp3\n05 Holly, Ivy And Rose.mp3\n06 Harps Of Gold.mp3\n07 Snow Angel.mp3\n08 Jeanette, Isabella.mp3\n09 Pink And Glitter.mp3\n10 Emmanuel.mp3\n11 Winter's Carol.mp3\n12 Our New Year.mp3\n\n\nEnjoy! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f38018ec127d8c7a55423498ccdd6919fc9ef2e","amp;dn":"Tori+Amos+-+Midwinter+Graces+%282009%29+-+192k+VBR+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f38018ec127d8c7a55423498ccdd6919fc9ef2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,56,1,142,193,39,216,199,165,84,35,73,140,205,214,145,159,201,239,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
