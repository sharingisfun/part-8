Every track on this album is great including &quot;In All My Wildest Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Are Many Stops Along The Way&quot;, &quot;Melodies Of Love&quot;, and &quot;Fly With The Wings Of Love&quot;.  Sample has made other excellent albums, including the 1979 follow up &quot;Carmel&quot;, but this one is one of the absolute best of the genre.  A contemporary jazz masterpiece. ~ Jeffrey Harris\n\nI remember my pops use to play this all the time.. Coming up in a household where music was always played and with my father being a great jazz fan i have developed the taste for jazz over the years.. I have been looking for this album for some years on cd and finally just recently purchased it .. It still sounds great in 2000 as it did when it was release back in 78.. Joe Sample is an accomplish pianist, writer, producer accomplishments are plenty with working with the likes of Take 6, Lalah Hathaway, being a one time member of the great jazz fusion group the crusaders.. In 78 Mr Sample delivered what i do concern one of the best jazz albums in contemporary jazz from the opening track Rainbow Seeker it will have you hook.. In All My Wildest Dream.. which is my personal favorite track on the entire disc.. A few hip hoppers have sampled this great track 2 Pac, De La Soul , Arrested Development have used this tune at one time or another... Melodies of Love , another great track.. This song was redone last year on the Joe Sample/Lalah Hathaway CD .. On the latter mentioned the song had vocals added.. other noteworthy tracks.. Fly With The Wings Of Love, Islands In The Rain.. This is a must for all jazz fans to have in their collection. ~ Anthony Jamal Smith\n\nWhen this album originally came out, I had heard of Sample's work with the Crusaders and thought I would take a chance on his first 'solo' effort. I brought the LP up to the longhair at the cash register and he smiled and exclaimed: &quot;That's a GREAT record!&quot; Little did I know..... \n\nNow 20 years later, this CD is still in constant rotation in my house and car. This IS the BEST of Joe Sample. Great writing and arranging. A great 'Road Trip' album. Pre &quot;smooth-jazz&quot; B.S. A perfect album. \n\nA few of these tunes were remade on the album &quot;Sample This&quot;. Nicely done, but the originals stick with me. Don't be afraid to buy this one! ~ W.
