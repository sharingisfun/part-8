Dardo's stake in the matter becomes personal when his former wife Francesca (Lynne Baggett) moves in with Hessian leader Allenby (Robert Douglas). Francesca demands that the Hessians reclaim her son from Dardo; in retaliation, Dardo kidnaps Anne (Virginia Mayo), Allenby's niece. Allenby responds to this by taking several locals as hostages. This can't go on forever, so Dardo surrenders to Allenby and resigns himself to be hanged. Dardo's cronies, an acrobatic troupe headed by Nick Cravat (Lancaster's former circus partner and lifelong crony), rescue all the good people and wipe out the bad. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042464/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042464/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-42464/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-42464/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAwards:\nNominated for 2 Oscars\n\n\nDirector:\nJacques Tourneur\n\n\n\n        Burt Lancaster\t ... \tDardo Bartoli\n\n\tVirginia Mayo\t... \tAnne de Hesse\n\tRobert Douglas\t... \tMarchese Alessandro de Granazia\n\tAline MacMahon\t... \tNonna Bartoli\n\tFrank Allenby\t... \tCount Ulrich aka The Hawk\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:24:42\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 576x432  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1661 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:113fd5b9fc000950fc1d8b0d7c9798849bf9987b","amp;dn":"The+Flame+and+the+Arrow+%281950%29+Burt+Lancaster+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"113fd5b9fc000950fc1d8b0d7c9798849bf9987b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,63,213,185,252,0,9,80,252,29,139,13,124,151,152,132,155,249,152,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
