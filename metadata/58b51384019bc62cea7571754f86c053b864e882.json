Along the way Muhammad Ali makes several famous appearances on Parkinson in the 1970s, and talks to David Frost in The Frost Interview. In the course of these appearances he discusses his fighting career, his frank views on religion and society, his vision of a separate black-only American state, and his lack of formal education. The 1980s find him answering questions about his impending retirement and rumours that he is suffering from ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Muhammad-Ali-His-Words-Archive/dp/1445846608&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Muhammad-Ali-His-Words-Archive/dp/1445846608&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58b51384019bc62cea7571754f86c053b864e882","amp;dn":"Muhammad+Ali+-+In+His+Own+Words+%282012%29+%5B96+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58b51384019bc62cea7571754f86c053b864e882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,181,19,132,1,155,198,44,234,117,113,117,79,134,192,83,184,100,232,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
