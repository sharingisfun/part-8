The album's music was the complete departure from the progressive Krautrock of the two previous albums, in favor of a heavy metal sound of shorter and tighter arrangements with which the band would achieve their later global success and fame, extended suites in the vein of songs such as &quot;Lonesome Crow&quot; and &quot;Fly to the Rainbow&quot; are absent altogether. It is the first album by the band to contain the now-famous logo and controversial artwork.\n\nThe original version of the album cover, photographed by Michael von Gimbut, was censored for clearly showing the cover model's exposed breast hanging down towards the guitar. Later releases have the breast blacked out so that it is not visible. This is the first of many Scorpions album covers that have been censored. The band's former lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth claimed he may have come up with the &quot;idea to do the thing with the guitar for the cover of In Trance&quot;. \n\nHowever, in a 2008 interview Roth claimed that early Scorpions album covers in general were &quot;the record company's idea, but we certainly didn't object. And so shame on us. Those covers were probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever been involved with.&quot; He did, though, classify the In Trance cover as &quot;borderline&quot;. \n\nThe White Stratocaster shown on the cover belonged to Roth and he can be seen playing the same guitar on the cover of the Electric Sun album Fire Wind. This is the guitar that Roth used on all subsequent Scorpions and Electric Sun albums on which he played. \n\nThis was the band's first album to feature the band's name written in the now-familiar font used on nearly all subsequent album covers, as well as their first collaboration with producer Dieter Dierks.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n \n01. \t&quot;Dark Lady&quot;   \tUli Jon Roth \t3:30\n02. \t&quot;In Trance&quot;   \tRudolf Schenker, Klaus Meine \t4:47\n03. \t&quot;Life's Like a River&quot;   \tRoth, Schenker, Fortmann \t3:54\n04. \t&quot;Top of the Bill&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t3:26\n05. \t&quot;Living and Dying&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t3:24\n06. \t&quot;Robot Man&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t2:47\n07. \t&quot;Evening Wind&quot;   \tRoth \t5:06\n08. \t&quot;Sun in My Hand&quot;   \tRoth \t4:25\n09. \t&quot;Longing for Fire&quot;   \tSchenker, Roth \t2:44\n10. \t&quot;Night Lights&quot; (Instrumental) \tRoth \t3:14\n\n\n    Klaus Meine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\n    Ulrich Roth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on &quot;Dark Lady&quot; and &quot;Sun In My Hand&quot;\n    Rudolf Schenker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n    Francis Buchholz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Rudy Lenners Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67459db5b7decdf77b714b395314659a7f0c6db6","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+In+Trance+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67459db5b7decdf77b714b395314659a7f0c6db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,69,157,181,183,222,205,247,123,113,75,57,83,20,101,154,127,12,109,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
