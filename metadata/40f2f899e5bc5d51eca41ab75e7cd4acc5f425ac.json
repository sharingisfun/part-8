It features an ensemble cast of actors including Michael Imperioli and James McDaniel. The series originally ran on ABC from September 21, 2010 to March 20, 2011.\n \nThe show's executive producer, David Zabel stated, &quot;This is a crime show but we will explore various nooks and crannies in the communities and within that context there's a lot of opportunity to see what's positive in the city and see what's heroic about the people fighting for what's best for the city of Detroit.&quot;\n \nThe 1-8-7 of the title is a specific reference to the California Penal Code designation for homicide, which has become a slang term for murder. The Michigan Penal Code designations for the various forms of homicide begin at 750.\n \nOn May 13, 2011, Detroit 1-8-7 was canceled by ABC. With the cancellation, series creator Jason Richman has said he is pursuing options for the series to continue on cable television, also stating that chances for the move are &quot;slim&quot;. However, the DVD set for the series, released on August 30, 2011, is billed as &quot;The Complete First Season&quot;.\n\n----------------\n\nThis torrent contains all 18 episodes from the show's first and only season, including episode numbers and titles.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f2f899e5bc5d51eca41ab75e7cd4acc5f425ac","amp;dn":"Detroit+187+%28Complete+Series+18+Episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f2f899e5bc5d51eca41ab75e7cd4acc5f425ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,242,248,153,229,188,93,81,236,164,26,183,94,124,212,172,197,244,37,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
