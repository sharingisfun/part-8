Firstly; DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t try to repair something that is not broken, you might break it. Secondly; the utility cannot repair it all, we are not like the all-seeing and all-knowing Oracle, we cannot anticipate each and every situation, but this all said; Complete Internet Repair should be able to help with most of your internet issues. Rizonesoft Complete Internet Repair might help (no promises) if you are experiencing any of the following problems:\n\nInternet or network problem after removing adware, spyware, virus, worm, Trojan horse, etc.\nLoss network connection after installing/uninstalling VPN, firewall or other networking programs.\nUnable to access any website or can only access some websites.\nPop-up error window with network related problem description.\nNo network connectivity due to registry errors.\nDNS lookup problem.\nFail to renew the network adapterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s IP address or other DHCP errors.\nNetwork connectivity issue with limited or no connections message.\nWindows update does not work.\nYou are having problems connecting to secured websites (ex. Banking).\n\nNote: The program should only be run when there are problems as it provides no speed improvements and the program may actually cause problems on a normal, working connection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b8340fa865de1cb158e7331ea899c47c5b97a1","amp;dn":"Complete+Internet+Repair+Win+Xp%2FVista%2F7%2F8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b8340fa865de1cb158e7331ea899c47c5b97a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,184,52,15,168,101,222,28,177,88,231,51,30,168,153,196,124,91,151,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
