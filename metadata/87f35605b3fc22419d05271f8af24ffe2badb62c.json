Based on J.B. Priestley's famous stage play and set in the year 1912, an upper crust English family dinner is interrupted by a police inspector who brings news that a girl, known to everyone present, has died in suspicious circumstances. It seems that any or all of them could have had a hand in her death. But who is the mysterious Inspector and what can he want of them ? Rather like Dickens in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Priestley's primary concern in this play is that of &quot;universal care&quot; and we can see from Alastair's mesmerizing performance that this is something with which he wholeheartedly concurred.\n\n\nPlease be fair and help me share by seeding this thank you \n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f35605b3fc22419d05271f8af24ffe2badb62c","amp;dn":"An+Inspector+Calls+%281954+Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f35605b3fc22419d05271f8af24ffe2badb62c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,243,86,5,179,252,34,65,157,5,39,31,138,242,79,254,43,173,182,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
