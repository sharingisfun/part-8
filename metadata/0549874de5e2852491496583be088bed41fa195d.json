Maybe the wedding is mid-day in the middle of a field, or perhaps the event is in a florescent-lit room. These scenarios can be particularly intimidating for beginning photographers who don't know how to handle the many undesirable lighting situations they may encounter.\nIn Shooting in Sh*tty Light, professional photographers Lindsay Adler and Erik Valind cover the top ten worst lighting situations and provide a variety of solutions for each. They explain which solutions are most practical and why one option might be preferable over another, examining such problems as extremely low lighting when no flash is allowed, strong backlight, and the light on an overcast day.\nUnlike other books that focus on natural light or lighting in general, this book addresses a very real need of beginning photographers, answering the question, Ã¢â‚¬Å“What do I do when the lighting is terrible?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lindsay and Erik candidly show you the tools at your disposal, demonstrating the techniques essential to getting the job done with minimal fuss.\n\n-    Shows how to deal with ten of the worst lighting situations, such as harsh midday light, extremely low light, and mixed light.\n-    Offers real-life examples and practical solutions for handling poor light, such as identifying natural reflectors, bouncing light off a wall, or utilizing flash gels. \n-    Features a fun, conversational style to help you conquer the fear of poor lighting and approach any lighting situation with confidence!\n\nAbout the Authors\nLindsay Adler is a portrait and fashion photographer based in New York City.
