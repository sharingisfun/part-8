Now, Johnny lives in the surreal, sun-drenched city of Palm Springs with his mother and her new husband. \n\nOn the outside, Palm Springs is a shimmering paradise of resorts, swimming pools, golf courses and country clubs. But he quickly discovers that this paradise isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite what it seems when he meets his next-door neighbours: Cliff (Michael Cassidy, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe O.C.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), a handsome high school junior whose considerable charm canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite hide his disturbing dark side; and Cliff's mother, Tess (Sharon Lawrence, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNYPD BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), a former Southern beauty queen with a taste for younger men. \n\nAs Johnny learns the secrets that lie just beneath the surface of this seemingly typical neighbourhood, he and his family are forced to ask the question: how well do you really know the people who live right next door?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce833af88855f1ba91f41251298b4e344060583","amp;dn":"Hidden+Palms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce833af88855f1ba91f41251298b4e344060583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,232,51,175,136,133,95,27,169,31,65,37,18,152,180,227,68,6,5,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
