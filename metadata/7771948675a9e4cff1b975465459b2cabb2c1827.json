Explanations are provided for each article in detail, with thorough discussions and practical examples that clearly illustrate how the Code and its most recent changes are applied. Discussions are logically organized into coherent subject groupings, allowing readers to navigate easily through 2008 NEC requirements as well as changes since the last edition. Through this approach, the book also integrates essential information into the 8th Edition that is not directly addressed in the NEC but is extremely useful to electricians.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7771948675a9e4cff1b975465459b2cabb2c1827","amp;dn":"Interpreting+the+National+Electrical+Code%2C+8th+edition+-+%28Malest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7771948675a9e4cff1b975465459b2cabb2c1827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,113,148,134,117,169,228,207,241,185,117,70,84,89,178,202,187,44,24,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
