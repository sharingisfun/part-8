Mary Mulvane, an 18 year old Irish girl, is transported to New South Wales for a term of seven years after attempting to take back her family's milk cow which had been seized by the British &quot;in lieu of tithes&quot; to the local proctor. She endures the trial of a convict sea journey to New South Wales and years of service as a convict before her emancipation and life as a free citizen.\n\n\nEpisodes:\n01. The Seeds of Fire\n02.

The Windfall Summer\n\n\nTechnical Info &amp; Acknowledgements:\n\nThanks to &quot;KnÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€žÂ¢&quot; for the original bulk of the episodes. These are the DVDrip versions that are out there and came in at 350MB per episode, not the cruddy YouTube versions that were whittled down to 200MB and had awful movement problems. Even though they were not captured at high screen resolutions, thay are still watchable, and movement is smooth. The trouble with the &quot;KnÃƒÂ£Ã¢â€žÂ¢&quot; stuff that's around is that Episode 8 is doubled up and Episode 13 is missing altogether, so after more searching around I found it on a Polish movie site (would you believe it), removed the double-up, renamed all the mis-named ep's and included the new one. So, thank you to that site that had it for allowing me to obtain it to complete this collection. I won't mention the site for spam reasons.\n\nVideo:\nOriginal DL's were XVID with variable frame sizes @ approximately 727kbps. When remuxed into MKV, then MP4 successively, I kept all of the original characteristics of the video component.\n\nAudio:\nOriginal downloads were MP3 @ 320kbps for the majority. I remastered the soundtracks (compressed for audio, levelled then amplified to -1dB) then re-rendered them at 448kbps AC3 to maintain the quality of the remaster.\n\nAs mentioned, I muxed them as MKV (in MKVMerge 'Nouages') at first, with XVID video and AC3 audio. I then remuxed them using MKVtoMP4 as people seem to like MP4 better, and it is more playable on more devices. Final files are MP4 containing XVID video and remastered AC3 audio, variable screen resolutions and weighing about 390MB per episode.\n\nAll things considered, this is a very good, watchable (and complete) version of this very hard-to-get series. I wish I had access to the original DVD's and take it from scratch, but in the absence of those discs, I'm quite happy to watch this version and remember a great TV series from my childhood.\n\nI thank all of those who seed when they are finished downloading. This is a big set of files and I'm on limited bandwidth, so all help is greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers,\nMoofieMan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:072a6b39bfad045268f0b9ae3a80d1e6b9e921d1","amp;dn":"Against+The+Wind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"072a6b39bfad045268f0b9ae3a80d1e6b9e921d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,42,107,57,191,173,4,82,104,240,185,174,58,128,209,230,185,233,33,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
