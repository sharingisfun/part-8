The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter pattern analyst for 'Miami Metro Police Department' (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department) who also leads a secret life as a serial killer, hunting down criminals who have slipped through the cracks of justice. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first of the Dexter series novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.\nDexter aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006 to September 22, 2013. In February 2008, reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS, although the reruns on CBS ended after one run of the first season. The series has enjoyed wide critical acclaim and popularity, including four straight Primetime Emmy nominations for Best Drama series in its first four seasons. Season 4 aired its season finale on December 13, 2009 to a record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime at that time.[citation needed]\nIn January 2013, Showtime announced that season 8 premiere of Dexter would air on June 30, earlier than the original fall/autumn date. In April 2013, following ongoing fan speculations, Showtime announced that season eight would be the final season of Dexter. The Season 8 premiere was the most watched Dexter episode ever with over 3 million viewers. The original broadcast of the series finaleÃ¢â‚¬â€shown at 9 p.m. on September 22, 2013Ã¢â‚¬â€drew 2.8 million viewers, the largest overall audience in Showtime's history.\nHall has received several awards and nominations for his portrayal of Dexter, including a Golden Globe award\n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;81c9e8e6e9c1cdb4afb0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 8 frames \nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC \nDuration : 52mn 55s \nNominal bit rate : 1 472 Kbps \nWidth : 1 912 pixels \nHeight : 1 080 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Constant \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.030 \nLanguage : English \nDefault : Yes \nForced : No \nColor primaries : BT.709 \nTransfer characteristics : BT.709 \nMatrix coefficients : BT.709 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : A_AAC \nDuration : 52mn 55s \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nBit Rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nLanguage : English \nDefault : Yes \nForced : No ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fcb0c8d9b5e920b2cee8d9a9868893e41f27d3","amp;dn":"Dexter+S08+Season+8+1080p+Web-DL+ReEnc-DeeJayAhmed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3fcb0c8d9b5e920b2cee8d9a9868893e41f27d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,252,176,200,217,181,233,32,178,206,232,217,169,134,136,147,228,31,39,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
