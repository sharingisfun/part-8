Alexandra Petri has auditioned for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Next Top Model. Afraid of looking like an idiot? Alexandra Petri lost Jeopardy! by answering Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who is that dude?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on national TV. Afraid of bad jokes? Alexandra Petri won an international pun championship.\n\nPetri has been a debutante, reenacted the Civil War, and fended off suitors at a Star Wars convention while wearing a Jabba the Hutt suit. One time, she let some cult members she met on the street baptize her, just to be polite. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a connoisseur of the kind of awkwardness that most people spend whole lifetimes trying to avoid. If John Hodgman and Amy Sedaris had a babyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦they would never let Petri babysit it.\n\nBut Petri is here to tell you: Everything you fear is not so bad. Trust her. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried it. And in the course of her misadventures, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned that there are worse things out there than awkwardnessÃ¢â‚¬â€and that interesting things start to happen when you stop caring what people think","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6f2d3c86b9572283c21926d55060f39f47feb8","amp;dn":"A+Field+Guide+to+Awkward+Silences+%282015%29+-+%28epub%2Fazw3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a6f2d3c86b9572283c21926d55060f39f47feb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,111,45,60,134,185,87,34,131,194,25,38,213,80,96,243,159,71,254,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
