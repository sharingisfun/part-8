From my knowledge of Blur, I don't believe there's anything missing, from their U.K releases apart from some &quot;fan-club&quot; only releases (about 5 tracks).\n\n\nBeginning as just another Brit-pop band with promise, Blur has exceeded all expectations. Their debut release showed a flair for catchy guitar-based tunes, their next three effectively channelled various British music traditions to create an eclectic and accomplished showcase for the band's songwriting talents. On subsequent releases, Blur has deliberately explored wider musical horizons. The outfit even scored the most unlikely and ironic of arena-sports hits with &quot;Song 2.&quot; Even after guitarist Graham Coxon's departure for a solo career, the Damon Albarn-led band continued to push ahead, releasing one of their most accomplished efforts with 2003's THINK TANK.\n\n\n***ALBUMS:-\n\n- Leisure (1991)\n\n- Modern Life is Rubbish (1993)\n\n- Parklife (1994)\n\n- The Great Escape (1995)\n\n- Blur (1997)\n\n- 13 (1999)\n\n- The Best of..
