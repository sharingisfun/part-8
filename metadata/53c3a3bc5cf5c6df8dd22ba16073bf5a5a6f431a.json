No\r\nregenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just\r\nyou, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing the weapons of fallen enemies to\r\nshoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\r\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and\r\ndisruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT's polished, minimalist visual\r\nlanguage helps you concentrate on the most important - on the fluidity of\r\ngameplay and the cinematic beauty of destruction.\r\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and\r\ndesign. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a\r\nhugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and\r\nnominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by it's\r\nindependant, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nFor more info go to : https://www.gog.com/game/superhot\r\n\r\n-Install\r\n-Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c3a3bc5cf5c6df8dd22ba16073bf5a5a6f431a","amp;dn":"SUPERHOT+%282.2.0.6%29-GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c3a3bc5cf5c6df8dd22ba16073bf5a5a6f431a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,195,163,188,92,245,198,223,141,210,43,161,96,115,191,90,90,111,67,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
