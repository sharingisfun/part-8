In this riveting new thriller, Brown returns to his element and has crafted his highest-stakes novel to date.\nIn the heart of Italy, Harvard professor of symbology, Robert Langdon, is drawn into a harrowing world centered on one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enduring and mysterious literary masterpiecesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inferno.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Langdon battles a chilling adversary and grapples with an ingenious riddle that pulls him into a landscape of classic art, secret passageways, and futuristic science. Drawing from DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark epic poem, Langdon races to find answers and decide whom to trustÃ¢â‚¬Â¦before the world is irrevocably altered.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nBrown's (The Lost Symbol, 2009, etc.) latest, in which a very bad guy is convinced that there are entirely too many people roaming the surface of the planet, and, because he's a fan of Dante and the Plague both, he's set to unleash inferno upon the world. Naturally enough, this being a Brown novel, someone is in possession of a piece of occult knowledge that will save the day--or not. The novel is populated with the usual elements in the form of secret, conspiratorial organizations and villains on the way to being supervillains, and readers of a literary bent may find the writing tortured: &quot;This morning, as he stepped onto the private balcony of his yacht's stateroom, the provost looked across the churning sea and tried to fend off the disquiet that had settled in his gut.&quot; To his credit, Brown's yarn is somewhat more tightly constructed than his earlier Langdon vehicles, though its best parts are either homages or borrowings; the punky chick assassin who threatens Langdon, for instance, seems to have wandered in from a Stieg Larsson set, while the car-chase-and-explosions stuff, to say nothing of Langdon's amnesiac wanderings around the world, would seem to be a nod to Robert Ludlum. (Being chased by a drone is a nice touch, though.) If you want more of the great medieval poet Dante woven into a taut thriller, see Matthew Pearl's The Dante Club. Ace symbologist Robert Langdon returns, and the world trembles. Perfect escapist reading for fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cfe2b8a51b78d8449c03a44f49cb3fd5767d97","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+Inferno+%5B128+CD+Rips%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cfe2b8a51b78d8449c03a44f49cb3fd5767d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,207,226,184,165,27,120,216,68,156,3,164,79,73,203,63,213,118,125,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
