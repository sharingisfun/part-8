With his first book, The Natural Navigator, he started a renaissance in the rare art of reading natureâ€™s clues.\r\n\r\nNow, in The Lost Art of Reading Natureâ€™s Signs, Gooley has compiled more than 850 outdoor tipsâ€”many not found in any other book in the worldâ€”that will open readersâ€™ eyes to natureâ€™s hidden logic. He shares techniques for forecasting and tracking, and for walking in the country or city, along the coast, and by night. This is the ultimate resource on what the land, sun, moon, stars, plants, animals, and clouds can revealâ€”if you only know how to look!\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                                     .:.Shailab.:.\r\n\r\n\t\t        https://thepiratebay.se/user/shailab/\r\n\r\n      \t\t            https://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97757c2bd4f3f800fc1ef68a77c861a54838f574","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Art+of+Reading+Nature%27s+Signs+-+Tristan+Gooley%28shailab%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97757c2bd4f3f800fc1ef68a77c861a54838f574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,117,124,43,212,243,248,0,252,30,246,138,119,200,97,165,72,56,245,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
