They've sold ludicrous numbers of records and been involved in three of the longest-running number one pop singles in history, and they've done it as a unit of equals. In fact, their four-part harmonies blend so smoothly that most of the general public would be hard-pressed to name any of the group's individual members. And that's no reflection on their skill as singers; Boyz II Men were among the first male urban soul artists to adopt the sort of hyper-technical melodic embellishments that were popularized by virtuosic divas like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Their early music was indebted to new jack swing, but the group quickly found their fortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in lush, soulful ballads, where their harmonies could be showcased to greatest effect. Boyz II Men may never duplicate their incredible run of success during the first half of the '90s, but that's a near-impossible task for anyone, even with the broad-based appeal of their clean-cut romantic image. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Please Don't Go\n02.Lonely Heart\n03.This Is My Heart\n04.Uhh Ahh\n05.It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\n06.Motownphilly\n07.Under Pressure\n08.Sympin\n09.Little Things\n10.Your Love\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8fc594b44190641428b4adb7915aac51446af1","amp;dn":"Boyz+II+Men+-+Cooleyhighharmony+%281991%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8fc594b44190641428b4adb7915aac51446af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,143,197,148,180,65,144,100,20,40,180,173,183,145,90,172,81,68,106,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
