A powerful violin concerto with a virtuosic and lyrical solo part and dramatic, colorful orchestral accompaniment, it receives its best performance to date by the Tanglewood Orchestra under the baton of Ryan McAdams and features the remarkable soloist Stephanie Nussbaum. Also included are two intense pieces of Crowleana, the bizarre and expansive solo piano piece . ? . and the whirlwind numerological miniature for three celli dedicated to the legendary new music virtuoso Fred Sherry 777, which maestro Charles Wuorinen considers one of Zorn's most remarkable works.
