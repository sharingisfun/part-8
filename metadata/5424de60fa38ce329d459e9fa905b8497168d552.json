Wilkins\nThis CD is by far my favorite of Heart's. I think it was one of the first CD's I ever bought. I remember listening to 'Alone' and marvelling at the complete lack of hiss in the totally DDD recording.\n\nBut the songs hold up too, as I soon discovered. 'Who Will You Run To' is great, but one of my personal faves is 'Wait for an Answer'. I love how the song builds in fervor and intensity. Of course, any song Nancy is lead vocalist on ('There's the Girl' and 'Strangers of the Heart') goes right up there. Nancy has a beautiful voice.\n\n'Alone' is a cool tune as well as 'Bad Animals'. Great stuff. This CD harkens from, what amounts to the Best 6 years of popular music, 1985-1990. This era includes U2 - The Joshua Tree; Peter Gabriel - So; Genesis - No Jacket Required; Midnight Oil - Blue Sky Mining, as well as others I think are slipping my mind right now. That's quality company. It's an awesome follow up to 1985's self-titled album. Sadly, I didn't find the follow-up, 1990's 'Brigade' to be as good, perhaps since this was such an excellent album. Still, if you want to get a great taste of Heart, this is an excellent start.\n\nHeart is an excellent band and they also do some excellent renditions of Led Zeppelin tunes, like 'Rock and Roll' and a personal favorite 'Battle of Evermore'\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeart - Bad Animals\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Heart\nAlbum................: Bad Animals\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 65 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 266kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
