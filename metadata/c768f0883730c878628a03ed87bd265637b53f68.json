As most beer lovers know, the world of beer has grown far beyond the common pilsener-style beers brewed by the millions of barrels by conglomerate breweries. Today beers rival wine in complexity, variety, and sophistication. In ARTISAN BEER, Gary Monterosso explores this new beer landscape to enrich the beer experience for every drinker. \n\n\nThe book surveys styles of beer, from ales and lagers to porters, lambics, and stouts, encouraging beer enthusiasts to sample and appreciate unusual beers from around the world. The book looks at pairing beer with food, an intriguing culinary frontier, with advice on beer choices that pair with everything from roast chicken to dark chocolate. One chapter details a Ã¢â‚¬Å“dream teamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ case of 24 beers every beer lover must find and try, for their excellence and singularity. And the author covers how to hold a beer tasting, strategies for maximizing your enjoyment of beer festivals, how to select and store beers for aging, and much more. \n\n\nAny beer enthusiast will find ARTISAN BEER a rewarding read. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck out my other Brewing Books, Zymurgy and BYO torrents\n                                                 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hheyyouguys&lt;/a&gt;\t(NOTE: If TPB keeps changing domains (ie... .org to .sx to .se), you will have to change it yourselves to see my other torrents)\t \n\n\n***************************************\n\t\t\t\nAlways looking for new brewing books digital or otherwise.
