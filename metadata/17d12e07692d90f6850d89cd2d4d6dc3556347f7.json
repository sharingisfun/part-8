IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve long enjoyed guitarist Liberty\nEllmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing, having heard him both in the great Henry ThreadgillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nensembles and on his own recording Tactiles (which seem filled with promise not\nquite realized). A fluid, clean-toned player with a very advanced rhythmic\nconcept and an ear for synthesizing improbable idiomatic combinations, Ellman\nproves on this disc that he can flat out write.\n\nHis unpredictable, ever-wending guitar lines form the root of these pieces; but\nthey all bounce and shuffle and swing and funk, sitting at the intersection of\nThreadgill, Steve ColemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Five Elements, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ yes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Warne Marsh. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s joined\nhere by an exceptional band, with saxophonists Mark Shim and Steve Lehman, tuba\nfreakazoid Jose Davila, bassist Stephan Crump and drummer Gerald Cleaver. The\ntwo saxophonists place an intriguing stylistic contrast (roughly between\nShorter-like reserve and BraxtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s antic angularity) front and center, with the\nseparate axes of Crump/CleaverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s turn-on-a-dime and Ellman/DavilaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s serpentine\nlinearity pulling in their own directions. The compositions are all about the\nreconciliation of these momentums, not so much finding a common denominator as\nhousing them in elaborate rhythmic structures that still possess ice sculpture\nbrilliance. Hear this most notably in the discÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s title track, whose Very Very\nCircus oomph is buoyed by some serious funk.\n\nMuch of the music indeed has more bounce to the ounce like this, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nneither slick nor one-dimensional. For example, on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Have EarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the\nquirky-jerk arrangement of disparate lines and rhythms is both immediate and\nbrain-teasing (with Lehman and ShimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blue flames crossing back and forth). On\nthe coiled funk of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTarmacadam,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ EllmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s out-of-time runs are both slyly\nsubversive and marvelously apposite. But this is a far richer album than some\nmere collection of grooves. Consider the ominous electric clouds of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnow LipsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBorealis,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the aching ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAestivationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (with an insanely expressive\nLehman solo), or the slinky noir ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChromos,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ whose counterlines and held tones\nare perhaps the discÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strongest moment.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fully realized statement by a wonderful improviser, composer, and\nbandleader. A sure sign of improvised musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vitality and passion, this disc is\na lock for year-end ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBest ofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lists.\n\n\nBy Scott Yanow &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/ophiuchus-butterfly-r834215&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/ophiuchus-butterfly-r834215&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Aaron Steinberg &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/17083-ophiuchus-butterfly-liberty-ellman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/17083-ophiuchus-butterfly-liberty-ellman&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Mark F.
