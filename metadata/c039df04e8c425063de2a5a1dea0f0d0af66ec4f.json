This course concentrates on using Rhino 4.0 for industrial design and rapid prototyping, with a review of common 3D terminology using specific examples. Along with a comprehensive exploration of the Rhino interface, the course includes an introduction to building 3D objects with Rhino's three primary entities: the curve, the surface, and the solid. Exercise files are included with the course.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/9969/fymn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img841/9969/fymn.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\n\n:Support:\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c039df04e8c425063de2a5a1dea0f0d0af66ec4f","amp;dn":"Rhino+4.0+Essential+Training+-+Lynda.com+-+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c039df04e8c425063de2a5a1dea0f0d0af66ec4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,57,223,4,232,196,37,6,61,226,165,161,222,160,240,208,175,102,236,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
