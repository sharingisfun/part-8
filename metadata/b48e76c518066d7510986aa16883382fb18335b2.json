Steak is William Rice's avocation, his passion, and he's researched different preparations and flavors of steak from all over the world. A collection of over 140 recipes, steak lover's cookbook is divided between fancy uptown cuts (e.g., tenderloins, porterhouses, ribs) and the plainer but just as tasty downtown cuts (skirt, chuck, flank, round). It includes the Best-Ever recipe for each type, plus dozens of inviting alternatives, not to mention Steak Fries, Outrageous Onion Rings, and Mississippi Mud Pie. It's a steakhouse at home.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48e76c518066d7510986aa16883382fb18335b2","amp;dn":"Steak+Lover%27s+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48e76c518066d7510986aa16883382fb18335b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,142,118,197,24,6,109,117,16,152,106,161,104,131,56,47,177,131,53,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
