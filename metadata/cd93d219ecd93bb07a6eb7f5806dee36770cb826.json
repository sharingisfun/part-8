Professional letter writer Samara O'Shea is here to spark your creativity and answer all your letter-writing questions in this charming guide.\n\nFor the Love of Letters is an anecdotal primer on letter writing, with tips on how to write all types of notes: love letters, break-up letters, apology letters, thank-you letters, erotic letters (oh yes!), and more. It's filled with moving, funny, and embarrassing stories about letters Samara has written and received, including an apology from a guy who addressed her by the wrong name, a good-riddance e-mail to a capricious boyfriend, and multiple apology letters after getting fired from an internship at O: The Oprah Magazine. With a fresh, contemporary approach, Samara weighs in on appropriate methods for every situationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for example, when to handwrite, type, or e-mail (yes, e-mail) your letter. There is also a fascinating collection of engaging personal letters written by historical and literary icons such as Marie Antoinette, Beethoven, Edgar Allan Poe, Susan B. Anthony, and Emily Post.\n\nFor the Love of Letters will show anyone who has ever shuddered at the idea of sitting down and putting pen to paperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or fingertips to keyboardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how to craft persuasive, interesting, and memorable letters.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd93d219ecd93bb07a6eb7f5806dee36770cb826","amp;dn":"For+the+Love+of+Letters+%3A+A+21st+century+Guide+to+the+Art+of+Let","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd93d219ecd93bb07a6eb7f5806dee36770cb826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,147,210,25,236,217,59,176,122,110,183,245,128,109,238,54,119,12,184,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
