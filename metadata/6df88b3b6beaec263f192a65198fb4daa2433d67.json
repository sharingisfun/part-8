Now IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure if I really am saneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nOr if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost my mind once and for all. \n\nThere will be two spin off novellas for Aurora just so you know. And the first one will be up soon so keep a look out!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df88b3b6beaec263f192a65198fb4daa2433d67","amp;dn":"Lauren+Hammond+-+Asylum+Trilogy+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6df88b3b6beaec263f192a65198fb4daa2433d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,248,139,59,107,234,236,38,63,25,42,101,25,143,180,218,162,67,61,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
