Many of these hits are included on this four disc set, which traces Jerry Lee s story from his legendary Sun Rock n Roll recordings of the 50s, through too his subsequent Country successes and the wide variety of hits and classics he made for the Smash, Mercury, Elektra and MCA labels during the 60s, 70s and 80s.\n\nBut his controversial sound bites all tend to blur the basic fact that Jerry Lee is one of the most talented musicians who ever lived. One of the all-time great vocal stylists and Rock &amp; Roll s quintessential live performer, his genius is wholly instinctive. He turned up at Sun Records in 1956 with a style that was already more or less fully developed and which required neither compromise nor improvement. And he was cutting killers (pun intended) from his very first session. (amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nJerry Lee Lewis - A Whole Lotta Jerry Lee Lewis\n(4CD Salvo 2012)\n\n 1. Crazy Arms\n 2.
