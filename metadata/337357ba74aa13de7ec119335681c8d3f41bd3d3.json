The author team's approach emphasizes collaborative learning and critical thinking while presenting problem solving in purposeful and meaningful contexts. While this text is more concise than the author team's Mathematical Excursions (Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2007), it contains many of the same features and learning techniques, such as the proven Aufmann Interactive Method. An extensive technology package provides instructors and students with a comprehensive set of support tools.\n\n# Hardcover: 724 pages\n# Publisher: Brooks Cole; 1st edition (January 12, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0618777377\n# ISBN-13: 978-0618777372","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:337357ba74aa13de7ec119335681c8d3f41bd3d3","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Thinking+and+Quantitative+Reasoning++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"337357ba74aa13de7ec119335681c8d3f41bd3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,115,87,186,116,170,19,222,126,193,25,51,86,129,200,211,244,27,211,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
