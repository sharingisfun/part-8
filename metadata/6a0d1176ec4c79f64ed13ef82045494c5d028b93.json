That's a problem because powerful enemies are at the gates, and all hopes have been pinned on a prophesy naming Po as the &quot;Chosen One&quot; to save the day. A group of martial arts masters are going to need a black belt in patience if they are going to turn this slacker panda into a kung fu fighter before it's too late.\n\nGenre: Action | Animation | Comedy | Family\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a0d1176ec4c79f64ed13ef82045494c5d028b93","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Panda.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a0d1176ec4c79f64ed13ef82045494c5d028b93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,13,17,118,236,76,121,246,78,209,62,248,32,69,73,76,93,2,139,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
