Not to mention her three intensely loyal Labs. But Fiona got to this point by surviving a nightmare.\n\nSeveral years ago, Fiona was the only survivor of the Red Scarf Killer, who shot and killed FionaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cop fiancÃƒÂ© and his K-9 partner.\n\nOn Orcas Island, Fiona has found the peace and solitude necessary to rebuild her life. But all that changes on the day Simon Doyle barrels up her drive, desperate for her help. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an intensely private wood artist and the reluctant owner of an out-of-control puppy named Jaws.\n\nAs Fiona embarks on training Jaws, and Simon begins to appreciate both dog and trainer, the past tears back into FionaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. A copycat killer has emerged out of the shadows, a man whose bloodlust has been channeled by a master with one motive: to reclaim the woman who slipped out of his hands . . .\n\nPublisher: Jove; Reprint edition (April 12, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0515149489\nISBN-13: 978-0515149487\n\n \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be73d8c8fbabc85f4ea6a51e6802e8468fa24d7","amp;dn":"The+Search+By+Nora+Roberts+%28Abee%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be73d8c8fbabc85f4ea6a51e6802e8468fa24d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,231,61,140,143,186,188,133,244,234,106,81,230,128,46,132,104,250,36,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
