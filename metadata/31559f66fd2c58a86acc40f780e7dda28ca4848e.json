It's a old but good book to General Chemistry and Materials Science students (or teachers).\n\nDescription (extracted from Amazon.com):\nThis resource volume, written especially for teachers of introductory chemistry courses, is in a ready-to-use format that will enable instructors to integrate materials chemistry into their curriculum. The book collects a critical mass of text, demonstrations, and laboratory experiments. The first ten chapters present a general introduction to solids; numerous easy-to-do teacher demonstrations are integrated into the material. The second part of the volume consists of fifteen laboratory experiments for students. Examples from cutting-edge research, as well as everyday life, spark student interest while illustrating the basic ideas that are important to an understanding of chemistry.\n\nInformation:\nAuthor(s): \tArthur B.
