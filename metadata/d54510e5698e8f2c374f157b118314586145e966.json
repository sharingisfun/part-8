A new light under which Grant can pick at his wounds.\nVitriol for a &quot;callypigian&quot; ex-boyfriend burns through so many of the songs that he almost called the album &quot;The Anger Stage&quot;. Against the the dark, throbbing disco of &quot;Black Belt&quot; he sneers: &quot;You are supercilious, pretty and ridiculous/ You got really good taste, you know how to cut and paste&quot; while &quot;Vietnam&quot;, whose sound brings back memories of the glossy 80s despair of The Cars -- sees him comparing the same man to Agent Orange, while admitting: &quot; I simply cannot find inside of me/ The requisite press on.&quot; It's gloriously cathartic whilst always swerving shy of mawkish self-indulgence.\nThe wonderful &quot;GMF&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which sways between self-aggrandisement and self-loathing -- is a return to the 70s sound of Queen of Denamrk, woven with gorgeous ribbons of chocolate-velvet harmony from Sinead O'Connor. The album ends with &quot;Glacier&quot;, matching grand, Rachmaninovian piano ascents with some realistically soothing words. &quot;Pain,&quot; says the man who was diagnosed HIV-positive in 2011, &quot;is a glacier moving through you/ And carving out deep valleys/ And creating spectacular landscapes/ And nourishing the ground/ With precious minerals and other stuff/ So don't you become paralyzed with fear/ When things seem particularly rough.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54510e5698e8f2c374f157b118314586145e966","amp;dn":"John+Grant+-+Pale+Green+Ghosts+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54510e5698e8f2c374f157b118314586145e966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,69,16,229,105,142,143,44,55,79,21,123,17,131,20,88,97,69,233,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
