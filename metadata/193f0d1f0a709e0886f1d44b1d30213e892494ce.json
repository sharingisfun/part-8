The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n                                 Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1\n\n\n\nGenius of Modern Music: Volume 1 is the name given to at least four different compilation albums by jazz pianist, Thelonious Monk. Each version comprises some of Monk's first recordings as band leader for Blue Note, recorded in 1947 (and sometimes 1948). The original LP with this title was compiled in 1951.\n\nTwo different CD compilations have been given this title. Both redistribute the material from the two volumes in a very different order. The individual volumes of both CD compilations omit a July 2, 1948 session featuring &quot;Evidence,&quot; &quot;Misterioso,&quot; &quot;Epistrophy,&quot; &quot;I Mean You,&quot; &quot;All The Things You Are,&quot; and &quot;I Should Care&quot;, which were released on a Milt Jackson compilation instead. A &quot;monochrome cover&quot; 2-CD set called &quot;The Complete Genius&quot; follows the track order of the original monochrome CDs, but adds all 10 released Blue Note performances of these missing 6 titles between the contents of &quot;Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Volume 2.&quot;\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Track listing of Blue Note LP 5002 (10&quot; 8 song LP, compiled 1951)\n    * 2 Track listing of Blue Note BLP-1510 (12&quot; 12-song LP, monochrome yellow cover, compiled 1956)\n    * 3 Track listing of earlier &quot;yellow monochrome&quot; cover CD, compiled circa 1989\n    * 4 Re-issue\n          o 4.1 Re-issue track listing, compiled 2001\n    * 5 Credits\n    * 6 External links\n\n[edit] Track listing of Blue Note LP 5002 (10&quot; 8 song LP, compiled 1951)\n\nSide 1:\n\n   1.

The cover art for the original 8-song LP was used. While the earlier CD grouped all takes of each title together, the recompilation put the alternate takes at the end of each session.\n\nThe July 2, 1948 session featuring &quot;Evidence,&quot; &quot;Misterioso,&quot; &quot;Epistrophy,&quot; &quot;I Mean You,&quot; &quot;All The Things You Are,&quot; and &quot;I Should Care&quot; was released on Blue Note CD Milt Jackson: Wizard of the Vibes.\n[edit] Re-issue track listing, compiled 2001\n\n   1.
