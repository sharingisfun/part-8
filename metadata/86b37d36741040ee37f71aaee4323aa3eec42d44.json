It connects via the internet to the ATC streams and then projects the audio in Flight Simulator. Although Live ATC does not come with any ATC streams, you can download them freely at www.liveatc.net. Live ATC enhances your Flight Simulator environment by adding real-time live ATC audio for the selected airports you fly at. If you don?t always have an active internet connection or you don?t want to connect to a stream while flying, Live ATC also offers the option to play either Mp3 or Wave sound chatter files. So whether you be online or offline you will be able to listen to Real ATC chatter in Flight Simulator.\n\nNOT TESTED BY ME!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b37d36741040ee37f71aaee4323aa3eec42d44","amp;dn":"FS2004-FSX+-+Cielsoim+ATC+LIVE+CHATTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b37d36741040ee37f71aaee4323aa3eec42d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,179,125,54,116,16,64,238,55,247,26,174,228,50,58,163,238,196,45,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
