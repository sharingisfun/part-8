At that time, Atkins, flush with a new contract from Columbia and full of commercial promise, laid down a darkly romantic set of torchy songs written about her hometown back in New Jersey. Seven years later, an ultimately wiser and more world-weary artist made a second Scandinavian sojourn to reconnect with producer Tore Johansson and assemble the shadowy and richly detailed Slow Phaser. If Neptune City was a nostalgic tribute and 2011's Mondo Amore was an edgy post-breakup album, then Slow Phaser seems to be the unthemed album of a more mature songwriter letting her muse carry her any which way. There is an uptempo, almost disco-like groove on tracks like the opener &quot;Who Killed the Moonlight?&quot; and the single &quot;Girl You Look Amazing&quot; which bring a sense of fun yet still retain the singer's noir-ish tendencies. Johansson's production places an emphasis on the band's bottom end with rich, deep basslines, and rocksteady drums like on the catchy &quot;Cool People&quot; and pulsing &quot;Red Ropes.&quot; Paired with a bevy of analog synths and other experimental affectations, this sultry, rhythm-heavy style is a great match for Atkins' smoky vocals and dishy delivery on &quot;The Worst Hangover,&quot; with its soulful backing vocals and proggy arrangement. On the wry, folky &quot;Sin Song,&quot; she sings a quirky call and response with the rest of the band in a sort of anti-gospel rave-up which then leads into the delicate and sublime closer &quot;Above as Below.&quot; Atkins has come a long way since her debut and without the distractions of a major label or a major break-up, she seems to be in the driver's seat and completely in control of her destiny, delivering her most artistic and confident album to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea3a9ed88e7890f2d4ea87453f4b61f2d6bbaef","amp;dn":"Nicole+Atkins+-+Slow+Phaser+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea3a9ed88e7890f2d4ea87453f4b61f2d6bbaef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,163,169,237,136,231,137,15,45,78,168,116,83,244,182,31,45,107,186,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
