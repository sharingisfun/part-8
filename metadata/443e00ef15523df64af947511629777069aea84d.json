Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the dean of newscasters at the United Broadcasting System, is put out to pasture because he &quot;skews old.&quot; Network executive Max Schumacher (William Holden), Howard's best friend, is forced to deliver the bad news. Beale can't stomach the idea of losing his 25-year post as anchorman simply because of age, so in his next broadcast he announces to the viewers that he's going to commit suicide on his final program. Network head Frank Hackett (Robert Duvall) is all for kicking Beale out then and there, but when it looks as though the UBS is going to have its greatest ratings ever on the night of Beale's self-destruction, ambitious programming exec Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) talks Hackett into treating that fateful final telecast as a special event. Naturally, Beale doesn't go through with it -- but he does begin rambling about the horrible state of the world in general and television in particular. He concludes his tirade by admonishing his viewers to &quot;Go to the window and shout as loud as you can: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!'&quot; With that, Howard Beale becomes the hottest TV personality in America, and Diana becomes the network's fair-haired girl. She draws up plans to treat the nightly news broadcast as garish entertainment (complete with a psychic), all built around the rants of Beale, billed as &quot;The Mad Prophet of the Airwaves.&quot; Network won Oscars for Paddy Chayefsky's screenplay as well as for three of four acting categories -- Dunaway for Best Actress, Peter Finch for Best Actor (in the only posthumous Oscar yet awarded), and Beatrice Straight for Best Supporting Actress, in one of the shortest-screen-time performances ever to win an Oscar. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Network.mkv\n      Format : Matroska\n      File size : 2.29 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 699 Kbps\n      Movie name : Network.1976.720p.BRRip.x264-x0r\n      Encoded date : UTC 2011-02-26 18:10:09\n      Writing application : mkvmerge v2.9.7 ('Tenderness') built on Jul  5 2009 13:26:28\n      Writing library : libebml v0.7.8 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AVC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n      Format profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;ade5c4cac5ede199839c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n      Format settings, CABAC : Yes\n      Format settings, ReFrames : 5 frames\n      Muxing mode : Container profile=&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;96c3f8fdf8f9e1f8d6a2b8a7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate : 2 197 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 2 250 Kbps\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 712 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate mode : Variable\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.101\n      Stream size : 1.86 GiB (81%)\n      Writing library : x264 core 112     \n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : A_AC3\n      Duration : 2h 1mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 389 MiB (17%)\n      Language : English\n   Text #3\n      ID : 3\n      Format : UTF-8\n      Codec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\n      Codec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\n      Language : English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English (muxed), French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nSidney Lumet - Network (1976)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443e00ef15523df64af947511629777069aea84d","amp;dn":"Sidney+Lumet+-+Network+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443e00ef15523df64af947511629777069aea84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,62,0,239,21,82,61,246,74,249,71,81,22,41,119,112,105,174,168,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
