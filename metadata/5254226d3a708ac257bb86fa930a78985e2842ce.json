The prolonged\nencounter between the Cro-Magnons and the archaic Neanderthals\nand between 45,000 and 30,000 years ago was one of the defining\nmoments of history. The Neanderthals survived for some 15,000\nyears in the face of the newcomers, but were finally pushed aside\nby the Cro-Magnons' vastly superior intellectual abilities and\ncutting-edge technologies, which allowed them to thrive in the\nintensely challenging climate of the Ice Age.What do we know\nabout this remarkable takeover? Who were the first modern\nEuropeans and what were they like? How did they manage to thrive\nin such an extreme environment? And what legacy did they leave\nbehind them after the cold millennia? The age of the Cro-Magnons\nlasted some 30,000 years--longer than all of recorded history.\nCro-Magnon is the story of a little known, yet seminal, chapter\nof human experience.\n\nCro-Magnon: How the Ice Age Gave\nBirth to the First Modern Humans\nBy: Brian M.
