Soon they owned small countries and corporate\ninfluence was felt at the highest level of world government. Smaller\ncorporations were swallowed up like plankton in the wake of three behemoth\nmega-corporations, one U.S.-based, one Europe-based and one based in the Far\nEast. These became the only effective world government, unelected, undemocratic,\nbut controlling the lives of the people through commerce.\n\nThen the European corporation perfected the CHIP. Inserted in the neck, the CHIP\nstimulated the brain stem to alter your every perception of the outside world.\nBetter than any drug, the CHIP gave hope to millions by numbing their senses to\nthe misery and squalor around them. One CHIP would convince users that the sun\nshone and the birds sang even as they walked through the constant acid rain\ndrizzle. Another that they were glamorous or handsome Ã¢â‚¬â€œ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d look in the\nmirror and see a different face Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while the rest of the world would see them as\nthey really were.\n\nThe CHIP was a technological revolution and sold countless units with the slogan\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœWhy change your world when you can change your mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. It also left the user\nopen to auto-suggestion and gave the corporations the perfect tool for\nmanipulating the populace.\n\nLike any new and potent drug, control of the CHIP meant control of the people.\nSoon the corporations were at war among themselves, desperate to monopolize CHIP\nmanufacture. But the corporationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ thirst for power left them open to\ninfiltration.\n\nWith money earned through pirating CHIP technology, crime Syndicates bribed and\nmurdered their way into corporation boardrooms. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t long before the\nSyndicatesbecame the controlling force all over the globe, with a finger in the\npie of everytransaction, criminal or otherwise, worldwide.\n\nAnd in the crime Syndicates of tomorrow those in control donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need uzis for\nbackup. Teams of custom-built cyborg agents hunt down rivals and traitors, and\nspread theinfluence of the Syndicates across the globe.\n\nOBJECT OF THE GAME\n\nThe aim of the game is to spread the dark stain of your SyndicateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s color across\nthesurface of the entire globe.\n\nThe world map is divided into various territories. From your home base in Europe\nyou invade adjacent territories and, through the violent subterfuge of your\nagents,wrestle them from rival Syndicates. Having done so, raise taxes on the\nlocals toincrease your profits and punish them for serving the wrong Syndicate.\n\nBut raising taxes can make you very unpopular. And furious natives leading\npopularrebellions can eat into Syndicate profits. So keep an eye on foreign\ninterests and pickoff troublemakers with your teams of agents.\n\nAnd while youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re busy expanding your SyndicateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s empire abroad, rival agents are\nworking in your own back yard to de-stabilize your Syndicate. Ensure agents are\nbriefed to weed out traitors whose actions might bring about your downfall.\n\nBy meeting all the challenges, destroying all targets and gaining control of all\ntheterritories, your Syndicate triumphs.\n\n\nYes the good old Bullfrog classic.
