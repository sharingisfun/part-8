It has also sold over 1.5 million worldwide but only 53,000 copies have been sold in the US.[1]\n\n\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                _Steffengd\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45eabe3382ccc79f16ad055b44b234471c6a1855","amp;dn":"Muse+-+Origin+of+Symmetry+++++By++++_Steffengd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45eabe3382ccc79f16ad055b44b234471c6a1855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,234,190,51,130,204,199,159,22,173,5,91,68,178,52,71,28,106,24,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
