In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack (reportedly his fifth) after overdosing on his muse at his studio.\n\n\n\nSU4C - Soldiers United 4 Cash Album\n\nTracks Featured:\n\n 1.
