It was also the first science fiction film set entirely on another world in interstellar space, far away from planet Earth. Forbidden Planet is considered one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s, a precursor of what was to come for the science fiction film genre in the decades that followed. The characters and isolated setting have been compared to those in William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Its plot contains certain story analogues to the play. There is also a reference to one section of Carl Jung's theory of the collective unconscious.\r\n\r\nForbidden Planet was filmed in Eastmancolor and CinemaScope, and features special effects which were nominated for an Academy Award. Also nominated was the first groundbreaking use of an entirely electronic musical score by Bebe and Louis Barron. Forbidden Planet also features Robby the Robot, one of the first film robots that was more than just a mechanical &quot;tin can&quot; on legs; Robby displays a distinct personality and is a complete supporting character in the film. The film was entered into the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 2013, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, Gotham, Star Trek, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23cafe93e46bc6bf4dce22a6a6e086cd2b7f95e7","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Planet+1956+1080p+6ch+2ch+subs+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23cafe93e46bc6bf4dce22a6a6e086cd2b7f95e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,202,254,147,228,107,198,191,77,206,34,166,166,224,134,205,43,127,149,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
