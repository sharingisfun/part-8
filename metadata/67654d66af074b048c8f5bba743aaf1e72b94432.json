Join Moose in the outdoors as he takes his shots and then follow Moose at his computer, processing the images in Photoshop and Camera Raw. Along the way, Moose talks about finding your own style, one-image HDR techniques, ultra wide panoramas, his choices for gear and gadgets, black and white processing, and image processing. Let Moose teach you how to bring home the big vistas so that people at home can enjoy them through your images.\n\nLesson 01 Ship Rock (6:08)\nLesson 02 Ship Rock Post Production (10:50)\nLesson 03 Ultra Wide Panorama (16:13)\nLesson 04 Panorama Post Production (23:46)\nLesson 05 Ultra Wide Pano Processing (17:19)\nLesson 06 Seeing the Grandure (7:16)\nLesson 07 Border Bluff Processing (11:58)\nLesson 08 Gadgets (6:50)\nLesson 09 HDR Shot (11:02)\nLesson 10 HDR Processing (14:49)\nLesson 11 Composing a Scene in Harsh Light (14:47)\nLesson 12 Black and White Processing (20:02)\n\nTOTAL: 02:41:00\n\n_______________!!!!
