Few bands manage to combine guitars and electronics as successfully. The first single, &quot;Shining Bright Star&quot;, is a stunning marriage of gut-butting bass guitar, droning synth, and menacing but melodic vocals. The opening track, &quot;Brenn di Ega Kjerke&quot; (&quot;Burn Your Own Church&quot;), is a nod to black metal. The flip side to the band&amp;#039;s personality is &quot;Girl Next Door&quot;, as downbeat and spooky as a 4 a.m. walk home, and the most surprising moment is a high-octane electronic cover of Bo Diddley&amp;#039;s &quot;I&amp;#039;m A Man&quot;, which will be the second single. The sum of these parts is a jaw-dropping debut. \n\nLabel: Playlouderecordings  \nCatalog#: PLAYR 23CD  \nFormat: CD, Album\n \nCountry: UK \nReleased: 19 Jun 2007 \nGenre: Electronic, Rock  \nStyle: Alternative Rock, Black Death Metal, Electro, Industrial  \n\nTracklisting:\n01   Brenn Di Ega Kjerke (6:37) \n02   Shining Bright Star (5:32) \n03   Girl Next Door (4:38) \n04   Blood Shot Eyes (5:24)   \n05   Not What You Need (3:02) \n    Backing Vocals - Vanessa Redd  \n06   I&amp;#039;m A Man (4:33)   \n07   Lady 13 (5:07) \n08   You Should Be (4:49) \n09   Buzz Buzz Buzz (3:56) \n10   Last Club On Earth (7:14) \n11   Crave For Speed (4:24) \n    Backing Vocals - Vanessa Freeman  \n\nSEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8634c78754b725412fe1fbd4a3a4be56be0a372","amp;dn":"BLACKSTROBE+-+Burn+Your+Own+Church+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8634c78754b725412fe1fbd4a3a4be56be0a372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,99,76,120,117,75,114,84,18,254,31,189,74,58,75,229,107,224,163,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
