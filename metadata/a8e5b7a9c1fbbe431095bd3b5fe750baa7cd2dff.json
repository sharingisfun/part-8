The book explores all of the widely-used modern types of motor and drive, including conventional and brushless D.C., induction motors and servo drives, providing readers with the knowledge to select the right technology for a given job.\n\nThe third edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout. New topics include digital interfacing and control of drives, direct torque control of induction motors and current-fed operation in DC drives. The material on brushless servomotors has also been expanded.\n\nAustin Hughes' approach, using a minimum of maths, has established Electric Motors and Drives as a leading guide for electrical engineers and mechanical engineers, and the key to a complex subject for a wider readership, including technicians, managers and students.\n\n* Acquire knowledge of and understanding of the capabilities and limitations of motors and drives without struggling through unnecessary maths and theory\n* Updated material on the latest and most widely-used modern motors and drives, including brushless servomotors\n* New edition includes additional diagrams and worked examples throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e5b7a9c1fbbe431095bd3b5fe750baa7cd2dff","amp;dn":"Electric+Motors+%26+Drives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e5b7a9c1fbbe431095bd3b5fe750baa7cd2dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,229,183,169,193,251,190,67,16,149,189,59,95,231,80,186,167,205,45,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
