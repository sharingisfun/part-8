The story \n\nis by Terence Rattigan who apparently based it on a scene he observed in the VIP lounge of \n\nLondon Airport when Vivien Leigh made plans to run away with Peter Finch and was stopped by \n\nher husband, Laurence Olivier. It is well filmed, way ahead of its time in certain segments \n\nwhere other minor characters are playing in the background of the scene, a continuum not \n\nemployed in movies until the nineties (this was filmed in the early 60s).\n\nCast: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Louis Jourdan, Elsa Martinelli, Margaret Rutherford, \n\nMaggie Smith, Rod Taylor, Orson Welles.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057634/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057634/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21733&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21733&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy  and  Seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1d7c3ed3a653fe405072fe9bc97df33d0b046d","amp;dn":"The+V.I.P.s+%281963+-+Richard+Burton%2C+Elizabeth+Taylor%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1d7c3ed3a653fe405072fe9bc97df33d0b046d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,29,124,62,211,166,83,254,64,80,114,254,155,201,125,243,61,11,4,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
