The Dresser is a compelling study of the intense relationship between the leader of the company and his dresser.Sir (Albert Finney), a grandiloquent old man of the theater, has given his soul to his career, but his tyrannical rule over the company is now beginning to crack under the strain of age and illness as he prepares for his two-hundred-twenty-seventh performance of King Lear. Sir&amp;#039;s fastidious and fiercely dedicated dresser, Norman (Tom Courtenay), submits to Sir&amp;#039;s frequently unreasonable demands, Tends to his health, and reminds hims of what role he is currently playing. The two men are essential to each other&amp;#039;s life. This is a film rich in comedy, compassion and love for theater.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085461/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085461/&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDB plot summary:\n\nIn a touring Shakespearean theater group, a backstage hand - the dresser, is devoted to the brilliant but tyrannical head of the company. He struggles to support the deteriorating star as the company struggles to carry on during the London blitz. The pathos of his backstage efforts rival the pathos in the story of Lear and the Fool that is being presented on-stage, as the situation comes to a crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efd99ab0d75d011a53a66a0639f994f6f497e460","amp;dn":"THE+DRESSER+%7E+1983+%7E+Albert+Finney%2C+Tom+Courtenay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efd99ab0d75d011a53a66a0639f994f6f497e460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,217,154,176,215,93,1,26,83,166,106,6,57,249,148,246,244,151,228,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
