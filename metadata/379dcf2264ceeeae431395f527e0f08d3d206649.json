After looking at all the other torrents of Bully I could find, this one is the highest quality (based on encoding settings and video bitrate), highest resolution, and the only one with subtitles. All of the external subtitles for Bully I could find in .srt format were terribly incorrect or out of synch, so I encoded the retail subs straight from the DVD itself, both English and Spanish, soft-coded. It was never released on blu-ray, so there are no HD sources, however, I cranked up the bitrate enough that if you full-screen it, the quality will be very good. In fact, I compared playing the DVD itself on a 26&quot; screen to my encode full-screened on the same screen, and the encode is actually much better than DVD quality. Quite a testament to how good x264 really is when it comes to de-blocking and smoothing. If you like Bully, see also my encode of Larry Clark's Kids (1995):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8322077/Kids_%281995%29_%5B480p%5D_x264_-_Jalucian&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8322077/Kids_%281995%29_%5B480p%5D_x264_-_Jalucian&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:379dcf2264ceeeae431395f527e0f08d3d206649","amp;dn":"Bully+%282001%29+%5B480p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"379dcf2264ceeeae431395f527e0f08d3d206649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,157,207,34,100,206,238,174,67,19,149,245,39,224,240,141,61,32,102,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
