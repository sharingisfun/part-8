Some return to visit after their first year exuding the vibe of conquering heroes. Others look, well, pretty bummed out. This book offers a plan to help the new college student complete Year #1 as a member of the first group. With anecdotes from current college students and recent graduates, the book presents five simple rules: Rule #1: Go to Class - I've never known a kid who flunked out of college who attended all his or her classes. Rule #2: Study 3 Hours X 5 days per week - How to transition from homework to study. Rule #3: Commit to Something - Don't drown in free time. Here's how to stay afloat. Rule #4: Get a Mentor - How to set up a support system. Rule #5: Procrastination Kills - How to rise above. The book is a short, non-preachy, fun, and tad irreverent primer that can help you get off to a strong start toward the 'best four years of your life.'\nGenre: Non Fiction , Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:529206891628d99ff6d812943afbe618599db4e6","amp;dn":"College+Success+Guaranteed+5+Rules+to+Make+It+Happen+by+Malcolm+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"529206891628d99ff6d812943afbe618599db4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,146,6,137,22,40,217,159,246,216,18,148,58,251,230,24,89,157,180,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
