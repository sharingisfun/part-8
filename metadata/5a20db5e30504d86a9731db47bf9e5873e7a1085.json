Carter, one of the greatest lyricist of all time came up right before he made a name for himself not only in the Streets, but also in the rap game. With the informative videos and nice story lines to go with the videos, Streets is Watching is a great way of understanding what the jiggaman went through on his way to the top. Director Abdul Malik Abbott (State Property), did an excellent job in capturing not only the situations Jay gone through but the different scenes and views of Brooklyn were great. Overall I gave this movie a ten, and would recommend it to even the hardest critique alive. I also can not forget to mention all the nice looking dancers in the film ;).
