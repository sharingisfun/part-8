Islamic craftsmen produced some of the finest pottery ever madeÃ¢â‚¬â€pottery that ranks in quahty with that of China and Japan; they produced superb examples of metalwork and fine carvings in ivory.\nTheir architecture, too, had great distinction and had a great impact on the Romanesque and Gothic schools of the West. Their textiles had a quality of design which the Florentines and Venetians were quick to copy. Moreover, the miniatures of Mesopotamia and Persia are to be counted among the finest in the world. In this splendid book, Professor Talbot Rice has now opened upÃ¢â‚¬â€for all to enjoyÃ¢â‚¬â€vast, comparatively unknown realms of exquisite taste and delight.\n\nwith 55 color plates\nand 193 black and white plates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a854899545a4be6b62b7bdee91cb09f0438f31eb","amp;dn":"Islamic+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a854899545a4be6b62b7bdee91cb09f0438f31eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,84,137,149,69,164,190,107,98,183,189,238,145,203,9,240,67,143,49,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
