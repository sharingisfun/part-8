For hundreds of years, they have championed themselves as guides to the art de l'amour through their literature, paintings, songs, and cinema. A French man or woman without amorous desire is considered defective, like someone missing the sense of smell or taste. Now revered scholar Marilyn Yalom intimately examines the tenets of this culture's enduring gospel of romance.\n\nBasing her delightfully erudite findings on her extensive readings of French literature, as well as memories of her personal experiences in la belle France, Yalom explores the many nuances of love as it has evolved over the centuries, from the Middle Ages to the present. Following along, step-by-step, on her romance-tinged literary detective hunt, the reader discovers how the French invented love, how they have kept it vibrant for more than nine centuries, what is unique in the French love experience, and what is universal.\n\nPublisher: Harper Perennial (23 October 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0062048317\nISBN-13: 978-0062048318","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc356f463288b430f30caf7d2ce92fe9b2089c0","amp;dn":"How+the+French+Invented+Love+Nine+Hundred+Years+of+Passion+and+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc356f463288b430f30caf7d2ce92fe9b2089c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,195,86,244,99,40,139,67,15,48,202,247,210,206,146,254,155,32,137,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
