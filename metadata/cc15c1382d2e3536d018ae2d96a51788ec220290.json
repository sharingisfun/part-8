Then, Alton auctions off his compost bucket forcing one chef to make a quiche out of the food bits that are normally thrown out. Finally, a clothes steamer and iron are the only sources of heat for a chef cooking mussels.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Mar-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc15c1382d2e3536d018ae2d96a51788ec220290","amp;dn":"Cutthroat.Kitchen.S02E13.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc15c1382d2e3536d018ae2d96a51788ec220290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,21,193,56,45,46,53,54,208,24,174,45,150,165,23,136,236,34,2,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
