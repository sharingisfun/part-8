The RIAA certified the record as Gold on 8 March 1984, and Platinum on 28 October 1991. The album cover was created by Storm Thorgerson of the design firm Hipgnosis and, as with earlier Scorpions album sleeves, courted controversy. However unlike several of their previous album sleeves the controversy did not result in the cover being replaced with an alternate sleeve. Recalling the cover photo, Thorgerson remarked, &quot;That one was funny. I don't think we figured it out. We just knew there was something rude somewhere.&quot; \n\nScorpions bassist at the time, Francis Buchholz, recalls that, &quot;Herman came up with the title for the album Animal Magnetism and we all liked it because it's an interesting title. So we had this guy Storm who was doing album covers for Pink Floyd, I think he did the one with the guy with the flames. So Storm came up with the idea for the Animal Magnetism cover, I personally didn't like it, but the rest of the band loved it. I liked the dog though.&quot;[6]\n\nIn some editions, an extra track &quot;Hey You&quot;, sung by Rudolf Schenker is included. This song was released on the same title single &quot;Hey You&quot; as side-A (together with &quot;The Zoo&quot; as side-B).\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Make It Real&quot;   \tRudolf Schenker, Herman Rarebell \t3:49\n02. \t&quot;Don't Make No Promises (Your Body Can't Keep)&quot;    \t2:55\n03. \t&quot;Hold Me Tight&quot;   \tSchenker, Klaus Meine, Rarebell \t3:53\n04. \t&quot;Twentieth Century Man&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t3:00\n05. \t&quot;Lady Starlight&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t6:15\n06. \t&quot;Falling in Love&quot;   \tRarebell \t4:09\n07. \t&quot;Only a Man&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine, Rarebell \t3:32\n08. \t&quot;The Zoo&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine \t5:28\n09. \t&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;   \tSchenker, Meine, Rarebell 5:56\n\nBONUS TRACK\n\t\n10. \t&quot;Hey You&quot; (sung by Rudolf Schenker) \tSchenker, Meine  4:29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33737916d39c8b5e62d37220487e95ecffa4bf33","amp;dn":"Scorpions+-+Animal+Magnetism+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33737916d39c8b5e62d37220487e95ecffa4bf33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,115,121,22,211,156,139,94,98,211,114,32,72,126,149,236,255,164,191,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
