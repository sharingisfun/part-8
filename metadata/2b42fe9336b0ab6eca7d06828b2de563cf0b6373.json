By noon, her career as a magazine editor, her relationship with a well-known photojournalist, and her very sanity are all in doubt. She finds herself marooned at a crossroads in Nowhere, Texas, wondering which way to turn.\r\n\r\nWhat's a girl to do? Certainly not allow herself to be lured into the ramshackle Lone Star Cafe run by two crazy old ladies who claim their coffee has mystical secret ingredients. Definitely not return again and again. And under no circumstances fall for the laid-back moves, twinkling eyes, and slow grins of guitar-picking local guy Graham Keeton.\r\n\r\nBut Laura can't help herself. Suddenly her uptight professionalism is out the window. She's landing in the most amazing, undignified, hilarious situations with Graham, and she likes it. What in the world is happening to her? Where is she heading, and why does it feel as if she's finally come home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b42fe9336b0ab6eca7d06828b2de563cf0b6373","amp;dn":"Lisa+Wingate-Lone+Star+Cafe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b42fe9336b0ab6eca7d06828b2de563cf0b6373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,66,254,147,54,176,171,110,202,125,6,130,139,45,229,99,207,11,99,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
