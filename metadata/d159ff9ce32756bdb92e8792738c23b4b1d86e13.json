With an emphasis on clinical-pathological correlation, the book includes in-depth discussions on disorders and issues that are frequently encountered but for which up-to-date information is often not readily available, as well as infrequent disorders unique or specific to children that are not covered in standard texts. Among the topics considered are malabsorption and motility disorders, immunodeficiencies, including AIDS, developmental malformations, food allergies, cystic diseases of the liver, hepatic tumors, and esophageal and pancreatic disorders. Many new illustrations and electron micrographs are included in this edition, and the high-quality endoscopic and radiographic images permit ready correlation with the pathologic principles under discussion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d159ff9ce32756bdb92e8792738c23b4b1d86e13","amp;dn":"Pathology+of+Pediatric+Gastrointestinal+and+Liver+Disease+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d159ff9ce32756bdb92e8792738c23b4b1d86e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,89,255,156,227,39,86,189,185,46,135,146,115,140,35,180,177,216,110,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
