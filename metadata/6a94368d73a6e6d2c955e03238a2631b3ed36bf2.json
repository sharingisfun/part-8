They may have a roaring fire in winter and a pleasant beer garden in summer. You can probably bring your dog. Above all, they have a notable character that raises them above the bland corporate pubs that blight the land. It can be hard to say exactly why â€“ but you just know a good pub the moment you enter. \r\n\r\nTrusted Telegraph reviewers have made their selection for you, based on highly personal but well-informed criteria, resulting in a nationwide pub crawl like no other. This is the perfect book for anyone who considers a good pub to be a British birthright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a94368d73a6e6d2c955e03238a2631b3ed36bf2","amp;dn":"Pint+to+Pint+-+A+Crawl+Around+Britain%27s+Best+Pubs+%282016%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a94368d73a6e6d2c955e03238a2631b3ed36bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,148,54,141,115,166,230,210,201,85,224,50,56,162,99,27,62,211,107,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
