We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.\n\nIn Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it controls almost every piece of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technology and holds key information on all of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residents.\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and more.\n\nUse the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.\n\n\nScreens:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef9f67b7d.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef9f67b7d.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef8b615ef.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef8b615ef.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef768caa6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgfun.biz/x/img-537fef768caa6.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nINFO:\n\n\nRelease Type ......: Direct Play\nRipped ............: Nothing\nRelease Date ......: 2014-05-23\nPublished By ......: Ubisoft\nGame Genre ........: Action\nPacked With .......: Winrar 5.10\nCrack Used ........: Steam006\n\n** You need to reach your Hideout and sleep before the game starts saving your progress! **\n\n** You will need to be logged into Uplay for this game to work properly, meaning simply YES YOU WILL NEED UPLAY INSTALLED if you want to play this game! ** \n\n\nINSTALL:\n\n\n\n1) Extract TPTB-WDGS.001 using 7-Zip 9.20 or WinRAR.\n\n2) Install Uplay software.\n\n3) Open Uplay and log in (just make a fake account using a different email address than your personal one)\n\n4) Run using Watch DogsbinGameLauncher_x64.exe\n\n5) Play.\n\n\n\nSYS REQ:\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements\n\n   OS: Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7 (SP1) or Windows 8 (Please note that we only support 64 bit OSs.)\n   Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400 @ 2.66Ghz or AMD Phenom II X4 940 @ 3.0Ghz\n   Memory: 6 GB RAM\n   Graphics: DirectX 11 graphics card with 1 GB Video RAM - Nvidia Geforce GTX 460 or AMD Radeon HD 5770\n   DirectX: Version 11\n   Hard Drive: 25 GB available space\n   Sound Card: DirectX 9.0c Compatible Sound Card with Latest Drivers\n   Additional Notes: Broadband connection and service required for multiplayer mode.
