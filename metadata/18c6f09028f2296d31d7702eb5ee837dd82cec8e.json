He manages to find a 1950Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s F1, which is an unfinished project. The bodywork has already been stripped of paint and this patina gives Mike an idea Ã¢â‚¬â€œ give this down-at-heel Ford a vintage rusted look. Drawing inspiration from this creative vision, Edd creates a paint scheme based on a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsandstorm in the desert,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ brands the windows with molten steel and builds a high-spec flathead V8 to blast it down the road. But will this eccentric truck with its unique Wheeler Dealers style find a buyer willing to pay a premium?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c6f09028f2296d31d7702eb5ee837dd82cec8e","amp;dn":"Wheeler.Dealers.US.S12e02.Ford.F1.x264-BeechyBoy.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c6f09028f2296d31d7702eb5ee837dd82cec8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,198,240,144,40,242,41,109,49,215,112,46,181,238,131,125,216,44,236,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
