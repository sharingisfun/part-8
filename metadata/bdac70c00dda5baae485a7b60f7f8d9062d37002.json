The RPG itself, while incredibly well-done, didn&amp;#039;t meet with much commerical success and was quickly cancelled.\n\nHowever, there is an active fanbase still using this gem of a pen-and-paper game-- including producing new material for it-- and as both an unusual and elegant implementation of their Storyteller mechanics, deserves to be preserved for posterity.\n\nThis compilation includes all of the published sourcebooks for the game, the &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; adventure released with the Storyteller&amp;#039;s Screen, and an article from Inphobia Magazine describing the villainous Bison&amp;#039;s secret apprentices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdac70c00dda5baae485a7b60f7f8d9062d37002","amp;dn":"Street+Fighter+RPG+Compilation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdac70c00dda5baae485a7b60f7f8d9062d37002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,172,112,192,13,218,91,170,228,133,167,182,15,127,141,144,98,211,112,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
