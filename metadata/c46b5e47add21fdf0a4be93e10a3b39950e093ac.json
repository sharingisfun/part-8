Its title is a play on the famous ultimatum by Patrick Henry, &quot;Give me Liberty or Give Me Death!&quot;, and is intended as a commentary on American consumerism. The album is a compilation of several of the Dead Kennedys prior works. 15 of the 17 tracks were previously unreleased on any of their albums. The original vinyl version had tracks 16 and 17 on an extra flexi disc. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in December 2007. This is the last Dead Kennedys album that Jello Biafra approved the production of as well as the last one on the Alternative Tentacles label.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n    * All songs written by Jello Biafra except when stated.\n\n   1. &quot;Police Truck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27 (East Bay Ray, Jello Biafra)\n   2. &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n   3. &quot;California ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œber Alles&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28 (Jello Biafra, John Greenway)\n   4. &quot;The Man With The Dogs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n   5. &quot;Insight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:42\n   6. &quot;Life Sentence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:41\n   7. &quot;A Child And His Lawnmower&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:57\n   8. &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46 (Bruce Slesinger, East Bay Ray, Jello Biafra, Klaus Flouride)\n   9. &quot;I Fought the Law (And I Won)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:21 (Sonny Curtis, new lyrics: Jello Biafra)\n  10. &quot;Saturday Night Holocaust&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21 (Jello Biafra)\n  11. &quot;Pull My Strings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47 (Jello Biafra, Bruce Slesinger)\n  12. &quot;Short Songs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:29 (6025)\n  13. &quot;Straight A's&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:15 (Jello Biafra, 6025)\n  14. &quot;Kinky Sex (Makes The World Go Around)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17 (D.H.
