What makes people act irrationally? \nIn a timely but thin collection of anecdotes and empirical research, the Brafman brothersÃ¢â‚¬â€Ari (The Starfish and the Spire), a business expert, \nand Rom, a psychologistÃ¢â‚¬â€look at sway, the submerged mental drives that undermine rational action, from the desire to avoid loss to a failure to consider all the evidence \nor to perceive a person or situation beyond the initial impression and the reluctance to alter a plan that isn't working.\n\nTo drive home their points, the authors use contemporary examples, such as the pivotal decisions of presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, \ncoach Steve Spurrier and his Gators football team, and a sudden apparent epidemic of bipolar disorder in children (which may be due more to flawed thinking by doctors making the diagnoses). \nThe stories are revealing, but focused on a few common causes of irrational behavior, the book doesn't delve deeply into the psychological demons that can devastate a person's life and those around him.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  just Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bda4eb8d17f9ad6f4faeddc37d24d97d4102a1c","amp;dn":"Sway-+The+Irresistible+Pull+of+Irrational+Behavior%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bda4eb8d17f9ad6f4faeddc37d24d97d4102a1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,218,78,184,209,127,154,214,244,250,237,220,55,210,77,151,212,16,42,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
