The band's name came from an inside joke about a Weather Report album called Mr. Gone where they referred to each other as &quot;Mister This&quot; or &quot;Mister That&quot;, and eventually selected &quot;Mr. Mister.&quot; Mr. Mister may be considered as representative of the melodic sound of 1980s pop rock.[3] The band consisted of Richard Page on vocals and bass guitar, Steve George on keyboards, Pat Mastelotto on acoustic and electronic drums and Steve Farris on guitars. Mr. Mister was the successor to the band Pages, fronted by Page and George from 1978 to 1981.\n\nThe Best of Mr. Mister is a compilation album of the 1980s band Mr. Mister's billboard hits and some of their other well-known songs. It contains the billboard hits &quot;Broken Wings&quot;, &quot;Kyrie&quot;, &quot;Hunters of the Night&quot;, &quot;Is It Love&quot;, &quot;Black/White&quot; and &quot;Something Real (Inside Me/Inside You).&quot; It ends with the previously unreleased song entitled &quot;Waiting in My Dreams&quot; (which was originally intended for 1990's Pull, an album that would go unreleased until 2010).\n\n1.&quot;Broken Wings&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n2.&quot;Is It Love&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n3.&quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:38\n4.&quot;Hunters of the Night&quot; (Page, George, Lang, George Ghiz) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n5.&quot;Run to Her&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n6.&quot;Something Real (Inside Me/Inside You)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n7.&quot;Kyrie&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:14\n8.&quot;Black/White&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n9.&quot;The Border&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:22\n10.&quot;Talk the Talk&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:11\n11.&quot;Healing Waters&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56\n12.&quot;Waiting in My Dreams&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4e66a8e4fd9951b5c7acb03354f32a0d445215","amp;dn":"Mr+Mister+-+The+Best+Of+Mr+Mister","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4e66a8e4fd9951b5c7acb03354f32a0d445215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,78,102,168,228,253,153,81,181,199,172,176,51,84,243,42,13,68,82,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
