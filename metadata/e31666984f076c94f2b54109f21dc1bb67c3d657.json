He is the frontman of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and was a founding member of the late 1980s supergroup Traveling Wilburys and Mudcrutch. He has also performed under the pseudonyms of Charlie T. Wilbury, Jr. and Muddy Wilbury.\n\nHe has recorded a number of hit singles with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist, many of which remain heavily played on adult contemporary and classic rock radio. His music, notably his hits, has become increasingly popular among younger generations as he continues to host sold-out shows.[1]\n\nPetty and his band the Heartbreakers celebrated their thirtieth anniversary with a tour in 2006, though Petty has occasionally released solo work, such as 2006's Highway Companion[2], on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation. Members of the Heartbreakers have played on each of his solo albums and the band has always backed him when touring in support of those albums. He has also toured with Mudcrutch in order to promote their debut album.\n\nPetty has been managed by Tony Dimitriades since 1976.[3] On February 3, 2008, Petty and the Heartbreakers performed at the Super Bowl XLII Halftime show\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1993\n\n\nGreatest Hits is a compilation album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in 1993. It is Petty's best selling album to date and was certified 10x Platinum (Diamond Award) by the RIAA on November 13, 2003. The single &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance&quot; became one of Petty's most popular songs reaching #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The other new song on the album is a cover of the Thunderclap Newman hit &quot;Something in the Air&quot;.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;American Girl&quot; (Tom Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30 \no\t(Originally released on the album Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.)\n2.\t&quot;Breakdown&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42 \no\t(Originally released on the album Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.)\n3.\t&quot;Listen to Her Heart&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01 \no\t(Originally released on the album You're Gonna Get It!.)\n4.\t&quot;I Need to Know&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:23 \no\t(Originally released on the album You're Gonna Get It!.)\n5.\t&quot;Refugee&quot; (Petty, Mike Campbell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21 \no\t(Originally released on the album Damn the Torpedoes.)\n6.\t&quot;Don't Do Me Like That&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40 \no\t(Originally released on the album Damn the Torpedoes.)\n7.\t&quot;Even the Losers&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 \no\t(Originally released on the album Damn the Torpedoes.)\n8.\t&quot;Here Comes My Girl&quot; (Petty, Campbell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \no\t(Originally released on the album Damn the Torpedoes.)\n9.\t&quot;The Waiting&quot; (Petty) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 \no\t(Originally released on the album Hard Promises.)\n10.\t&quot;You Got Lucky&quot; (Petty, Campbell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 \no\t(Originally released on the album Long After Dark.)\n11.\t&quot;Don't Come Around Here No More&quot; (Petty, David A.
