Pertwee remembered the Worzel Gummidge books from his youth and suggested a new small-screen version to Southern TV. Barbara Euphan Todd had died in February 1976, so Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall were recruited to write the scripts and a host of star names invited to play roles.\n\nKey among these was former dancer Una Stubbs, of Till Death Us Do Part fame, who appeared as the bad-tempered, antique-fairground wooden doll Aunt Sally. Despite her mean ways, Worzel dreamed of marrying the selfish and bossy Sally, although he fancied other maidens too, like Saucy Nancy (Barbara Windsor), the figurehead from an old galleon ship. (In the books, however, Worzel was married, to the gentle Earthy Mangold.) Child actress - destined to become an adult star - Charlotte Coleman was cast as Sue Peters. Although initially shocked to discover that the muddied scarecrow can walk and talk, a fact that they keep secret from the adults, Sue and her brother John were Worzel&amp;#039;s faithful young friends throughout the entertaining 31 episodes.\n \nCAST:\nJon Pertwee - Worzel \nUna Stubbs - Aunt Sally \nGeoffrey Bayldon - The Crowman \nJeremy Austin - John \nCharlotte Coleman - Sue \nMike Berry - Mr Peters \nNorman Bird - Mr Braithwaite \nMegs Jenkins - Mrs Braithwaite \nJoan Sims - Mrs Bloomsbury-Barton (series 1 and 2) \nMichael Ripper - Mr Shepherd \nBarbara Windsor - Saucy Nancy \nLorraine Chase - Dolly Clothes-Peg \nBilly Connolly - Bogle McNeep (Christmas special) \nBernard Cribbins - Jolly Jack \nThorley Walters - Colonel Bloodstock (series 3 and 4)\n\nNeed More Stuff, Please Visit\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/abqwerty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/abqwerty/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=523868&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=523868&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease seed all your downloads for others.\n\nThank&amp;#039;s OnlyMe1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f862c14608dbc127fd340fb502e95213ef454f2","amp;dn":"Worzel+Gummidge.Season+2-OnlyMe1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f862c14608dbc127fd340fb502e95213ef454f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,134,44,20,96,141,188,18,127,211,64,251,80,46,149,33,62,244,84,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
