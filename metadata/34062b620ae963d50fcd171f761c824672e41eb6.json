The text includes:\n\n- The basic architecture of PLCs and the characteristics of commonly used input and\noutputs to such systems\n\n- A discussion of the number systems: denary, binary, octal, hexadecimal, and BCD\n\n- A painstaking methodical introduction, with many illustrations, describing how to\nprogram PLCs, whatever the manufacturer, and how to use internal relays, timers,\ncounters, shift registers, sequencers, and data-handling facilities\n\n- Consideration of the standards given by IEC 1131-3 and the programming methods of\nladder, functional block diagram, instruction list, structured text, and sequential function\nchart\n\n- Many worked examples, multiple-choice questions, and problems to assist the reader in developing the skills necessary to write programs for programmable logic\ncontrollers, with answers to all multiple-choice questions and problems given at the end of the book\n\n****Prerequisite Knowledge Assumed****\nThis book assumes no background in computing. However, a basic knowledge of electrical and electronic principles is desirable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34062b620ae963d50fcd171f761c824672e41eb6","amp;dn":"BOLTON-Programmable+Logic+Controllers.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34062b620ae963d50fcd171f761c824672e41eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,6,43,98,10,233,99,213,15,205,23,31,118,28,130,70,114,228,30,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
