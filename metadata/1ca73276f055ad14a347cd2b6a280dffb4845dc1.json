All of their work to date, whether in photography, film, drawing, or sculpture, has demonstrated a deep interest in the mechanisms that animate the universe of objects.\n\nFischli and Weiss remove these things that surround us from their contexts in our daily lives, and then restructure their relationships to one another. The artists aim neither to glorify nor to alienate these common objects, but merely to create new references in which they might be considered.\n\nTHE WAY THINGS GO - without narration or interviews - simply records the self-destructing performance of Fischli&amp;#039;s and Weiss&amp;#039; most ambitious construction: 100 feet of physical interactions, chemical reactions, and precisely crafted chaos worthy of Rube Goldberg or Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n&quot;Their masterpiece to date... Using elemental means - fire and fireworks, blasts of air, gravity, and a variety of corrosive liquids - the artists manage to sustain a chain reaction of evermore absurd materials and events for 30 minutes.&quot;?New York Times\n\n&quot;One of the best films of 1987-88 didn&amp;#039;t appear on anybody&amp;#039;s top ten list. It wasn&amp;#039;t featured on &amp;#039;Siskel and Ebert&amp;#039; and it didn&amp;#039;t receive a single Academy Award nomination (although it would be hard to categorize a film in which the &amp;#039;best supporting&amp;#039; roles were foam and fire).&quot;\n?Arts Magazine\n\n&quot;This rudimentary yet showy masterpiece would have made Picasso envious.&quot;\n?Flashart\n\nMy rip\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
