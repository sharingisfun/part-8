The group has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide throughout their career. The band has been active in five decades, with their biggest success occurring in the 1970s. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCountry music is celebrating four-time GRAMMYÃ‚Â® winning band The Doobie Brothers with the November 4 release of Southbound, as some of countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest stars join The Doobie Brothers with Michael McDonald for all-new recordings of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic hits. \n\nThe Doobie BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most recent studio lineup harkens back to their earliest days. Fellow singer-songwriter-guitarist-lead-vocalists Patrick Simmons and Tom Johnston continue to front the group, while multi-instrumentalist John McFeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history with the Brothers dates back to 1978, after his stint with Southern Pacific. Michael McDonald returns to The Doobie Brothers for this project, which invites fans to once again Ã¢â‚¬Å“Listen to the MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a whole new way. \n\nIn choosing the album title, The Doobie BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Tom Johnston remarked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southbound seemed like the perfect name of this collaboration project with all these dynamic country artists. The band has a lot of roots, both musically and lyrically, from the South such as blues, country, R&amp;B, and folk. To us it was a natural fit that it be called Southbound&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031c328aabf176b0837a77f09f2378bdea22cb10","amp;dn":"The+Doobie+Brothers+-+Southbound+%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031c328aabf176b0837a77f09f2378bdea22cb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,28,50,138,171,241,118,176,131,122,119,240,159,35,120,189,234,34,203,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
