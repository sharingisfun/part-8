Entombed began their career as an early pioneer of Scandinavian death metal which initially differed from its American counterpart by its distinct guitar tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to include garage rock and other influences. This new style would eventually be described as death 'n' roll. Entombed have been influenced by bands such as Slayer, Black Sabbath, Autopsy, Kiss, The Misfits, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead and Discharge.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Band history\n    2 Personnel\n    3 Discography\n    4 References\n    5 Bibliography\n    6 External links\n\nBand history\n\nEntombed's debut album was Left Hand Path, a cult favorite that established the band as a popular Swedish death metal band. Left Hand Path and its follow-up, Clandestine, were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred to as a &quot;buzz saw&quot; guitar sound.\n\nWith the release of Wolverine Blues, Entombed changed their sound into a mix of hard rock, heavy metal and death metal, often referred to as death 'n' roll. Although this may have turned off many fans, it established their mainstream and critical reputation. Wolverine Blues is considered a classic of early 1990s death metal.\n\n1998's Same Difference was the band's first album without drummer and founding member Nicke Andersson, who left the band to concentrate on The Hellacopters. He was replaced by Peter StjÃƒÂ¤rnvind. In 2000, Entombed released Uprising, which was very much a continuation of the death 'n' roll sound. The follow-up, Morning Star, continue in the same style, but returned to their earlier roots of the 1990-1991 period.\n\nIn 2001, the band worked with performance artists Carina Reich and Bogdan Szyberb, and the Royal Swedish Ballet. The production was entitled Unreal Estate.\n\nThey have since released 2003's album Inferno, a continuation of the death 'n' roll style that has become their trademark sound. 2006 saw the release of the When in Sodom EP on June 6 (or 06/06/06). The full-length Serpent Saints Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Ten Amendments followed on July 9, 2007. On this album the style went back to death metal with a sound similar to their first two albums. This album is the group's first release with drummer Olle Dahlstedt (of Alpha Safari and exÃ¢â‚¬â€œMisery Loves Co.), who replaced StjÃƒÂ¤rnvind in 2006, and also the first without Uffe Cederlund who is now part of Disfear.\n\nIn September 2013, Entombed announced they have signed a deal with Century Media, as well as the title of their tenth studio album, Back to the Front, set to be released on October 29.\n\nDuring an interview conducted in September 2013, Entombed also announced that Alex Hellid is no longer part of the band. Shortly afterwards, the release date was pushed back to 2014, and no word has been heard since. Hellid, Cederlund, and Andersson also reunited to perform &quot;Clandestine&quot; in its entirety with a symphony orchestra, in February 2014.[11]\n\nOn January 21, 2014 it was announced that the Petrov/Dahlstedt/Elgstrand/Brandt line-up of the band would henceforth be known as Entombed A.D. and that the new album would be released under that name. It was also stated that any shows announced using the name Entombed would not feature this line-up.\nPersonnel\n\nCurrent members\n\nNone. The band is on hold. According to an interview in Sweden Rock Magazine #3 / 2014, with L-G and Nico, the name Entombed is now owned by all four original members, Alex Hellid, L-G Petrov, Uffe Cederlund and Nicke Andersson and is not to be used until further notice.\n\nFormer members\n\n    Alex Hellid - guitar (1989-2014)\n    Lars-GÃƒÂ¶ran Petrov Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (1988-1991, 1992-2013)\n    Olle Dahlstedt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013)\n    Nico Elgstrand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013)\n    Victor Brandt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013)\n    Nicke Andersson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, vocals (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1997), bass (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991)\n    Zoran Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990)\n    David Blomqvist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (1989)\n    Uffe Cederlund Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (1989Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006), bass (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991)\n    Lars Rosenberg Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1995)\n    Johnny Dordevic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (1991Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1992)\n    JÃƒÂ¶rgen SandstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\n    Peter StjÃƒÂ¤rnvind Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\n\n\t\n\nSession/guest musicians\n\n    Fred Estby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Matti KÃƒÂ¤rki Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Orvar SÃƒÂ¤fstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Peder Carlsson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ harmonica\n    Anders LindstrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Daniel Rey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    Ãƒâ€“sten Warnebring Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n\nSounds like we get at least one new band out of this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b1062907941ed36e6a3d8608cfa7e755d356dbf","amp;dn":"Entombed+A.D.-Back+To+The+Front+++MP3++320k+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b1062907941ed36e6a3d8608cfa7e755d356dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,16,98,144,121,65,237,54,230,163,216,96,140,250,126,117,93,53,109,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
