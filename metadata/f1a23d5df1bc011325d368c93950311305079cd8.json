[...] There's a lot to be said for a game that can make a grown woman squeal with glee dozens of times in a playthrough (especially a game that doesn't star Hello Kitty). In short, the long wait for Fez is entirely worth it. Play it, and I dare you not to smile.&quot; \n100% Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joystiq \n\n&quot;The game's unique artwork, its perspective-shift mechanic, its nostalgia for the 16-bit years and its bewitchingly strange setting all exist in total harmony and make a single, deliberate statement.&quot; \n10/10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eurogamer \n\n&quot;The sum of FezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games.&quot; \n9.5/10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IGN.com\n\n\n---System Requirements---\nOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, Lion strongly recommended, 32/64-bit\nCPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz or equivalent\nMemory: 2GB RAM\nGraphics: OpenGL 3.0+ support (2.1 with ARB extensions acceptable)\nHard Drive: 1GB HD space\nNotes: If using Intel HD 3000, Mountain Lion is required (driver issue).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a23d5df1bc011325d368c93950311305079cd8","amp;dn":"FEZ+%5BNative%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a23d5df1bc011325d368c93950311305079cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,162,61,93,241,188,1,19,37,211,104,201,57,80,49,19,5,7,156,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
