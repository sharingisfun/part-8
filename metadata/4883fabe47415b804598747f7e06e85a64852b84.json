Dr. Mickler, (played by Marlon Brando), is a soon retiring psychiatrist who helps Don Juan (Johnny Depp), come to his senses. He brings the costumed boy to the psychiatric hospital , in hopes of helping Don Juan find his identity. The doctor works with him for ten days, in which Don tells his life story.
