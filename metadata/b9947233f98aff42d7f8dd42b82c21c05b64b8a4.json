Nothin but #BANGERZ.&quot;\n\nPer wiki, on June 9, Cyrus released &quot;We Can't Stop&quot; as the lead single to her fourth studio album. The single... [topped] the iTunes Store singles chart in over thirty countries within hours of its release. The song's music video... received more than ten million views within 24 hours of its release, setting a record for VEVO. The video later broke the record for being the fastest video to reach 100 million views on the same site, accomplishing this feat in 37 days. The single went on to peak at number 2 on the Hot 100 chart, tying it [with 'Party In The U.S.A.'] for Cyrus' highest peaking single on the chart to date... WCS debuted at No. 1 in the UK, making it the first time Miley had cracked the Top Ten there. \n\nThe music video of &quot;We Can't Stop&quot; has been compared to other music videos such as &quot;Just Dance&quot; (2008) by Lady Gaga, &quot;Dirrty&quot; (2002) by Christina Aguilera and &quot;Criminal&quot; (1997) by Fiona Apple, all of which have the same theme and concept... The Huffington Post contributor Bonnie Fuller deemed the video &quot;very sophisticated&quot;, &quot;the culmination of a well thought-out plan and image change&quot;. She praised Cyrus for the message it sends as &quot;a high-spirited celebration of the freedom that young women are blessed with today to fully explore and celebrate their sexuality.&quot; Billboard was rather positive of the video calling it &quot;insane&quot;, adding that it is &quot;fantastically unhinged and purposefully button-pushing; this music video simply needs to be seen to be believed.&quot; US Weekly called it &quot;over-the-top&quot;, &quot;sexed-up&quot; and &quot;surreal&quot;.USA Today said of the video: &quot;All in all, it's a bizarre, entertaining but arguably desperate effort from the talented star.&quot; RyanSeacrest.com noted the video &quot;displays an edgier side&quot; of the singer, but that it is &quot;maybe a little too much&quot;. The video has remained at number 1 on the YouTube 100 since its debut two months ago.\n\nAs for the music, Idolator's Sam Lansky wrote that it &quot;doesn't sound like anything else on radio&quot; and that while it is a &quot;weird song&quot;, &quot;there's something kind of brilliantly woozy about it; it sounds quintessentially California. The whole thing just feels strange, and kind of wonderful.&quot; Entertainment Weekly in The Bullseye Section suggests: &quot;Miley Cyrus' new single 'We Can't Stop' sounds like she took 'Party in the U.S.A.' and forced eight Ambien down its throat.&quot; And for that, WCS won Summer Song at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards.\n\nMTV VMAs, AUGUST 25 -- WCS Noms: Best Female Video, Best Pop Video, Best Song of the Summer\n\nMiley will have the last laugh and even more than that for she will perform, 'We Can't Stop.'\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture9.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture9.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture10.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture10.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture20-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture20-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture17-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture17-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture21.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture21.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture15-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture15-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture8.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture8.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture12.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Miley%20Cyrus/NewPicture12.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9947233f98aff42d7f8dd42b82c21c05b64b8a4","amp;dn":"Miley+Cyrus+-+We+Can%27t+Stop+%282013+-+VOB+LPCM%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9947233f98aff42d7f8dd42b82c21c05b64b8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,148,114,51,249,138,255,66,215,248,221,66,184,44,33,192,91,100,184,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
