What many people fail to realize is that the theme music used in the WWE isn't wrestling music for the nostalgic, its a mix of all kinds of music, from rap to hard rock, soft rock to even R&amp;B, and thats what makes a great album. This 3-CD set journey will keep you rockin' all night, and for some, will bring back old, fond memories of the old times in WWE.\n\nCD 1, &quot;The Federation Years&quot;, will take you back to the 80's and early to mid 90's with themes like Hulk Hogan - &quot;Real American&quot;, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts - &quot;Snake Bit&quot;, Ultimate Warrior - &quot;Unstable&quot;, Shawn Michaels - &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;, and Mankind - &quot;Schizophrenic.&quot;\n\nCD 2 will take you through the latter part of the 90's, as the WWE moved into what CD 2 is entitled, the &quot;Attitude Era&quot;, with memorable tracks such as D-Generation X - &quot;Break It Down&quot;, Stone Cold Steve Austin - &quot;I Won't Do What You Tell Me&quot;, Chyna - &quot;Who I Am&quot;, Mr. McMahon - &quot;No Chance In Hell&quot;, and The Rock - &quot;If You Smell....&quot;\n\nAnd finally, CD 3, &quot;Now!&quot;, will bring you straight to the present with current tunes like Brock Lesnar - &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;, Eric Bischoff - &quot;I'm Back&quot;, Trish Stratus with Lil' Kim - &quot;Time To Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Chris Jericho - &quot;King Of My World&quot; (performed by Saliva), and Undertaker - &quot;You're Gonna Pay.&quot;\n\nAnd with so many more songs to name, it's value is definitely worth every penny. If anyone deserves a lifetime achievement award in this world, it is the composer of nearly all the songs listed on this album-Jim Johnston. I salute you Jim, and thank you for so many wonderful songs you have given us the opportunity of listening to over the years and now.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorld Wrestling Federation: The Anthology\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Jim Johnston\nAlbum................: World Wrestling Federation: The Anthology\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2002\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 251kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
