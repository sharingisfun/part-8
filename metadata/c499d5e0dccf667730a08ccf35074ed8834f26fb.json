Featuring nearly 100 authentic dishes plus lavish photography accompanying every recipe, this stunning cookbook is the definitive guide to ThailandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s culinary street culture. The recipes, such as Steamed Fish with Chilli and Lime Sauce, Pork Satay, Roast Duck and Egg Noodle Soup, and Sweet Banana Roti illuminate the beguiling world of food so integral to the Thais.\n\nScholar and chef David Thompson lives with a singular passion for ThailandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s customs, culture, and people. Although he claims Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the food,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this ambitious work shares his insights into the rhythms and nuances of Thai daily life along with a fascinating history of its richly diverse street cuisine. This cookbook is a tempting, inspiring, and authoritative account of Thai street food, the vibrant culinary mosaic rich with community.\n\nPlease note this is not a scanned but a photographed PDF.
