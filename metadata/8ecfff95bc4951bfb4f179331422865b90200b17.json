He is that good.\n\nSome songs are really moving.  If &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot; doesn't make your woman melt in your arms she has ice water for blood (probably something you did).  Play these songs for Valentine's Day and look her in the eye and...don't say anything.  Just give her the look that says she is your everything.  The rest will work itself out.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBy Babushka\n\nHere is the CD that sets the mood for romance. The only reason this album is added to my collection is the flavor of Rod Stewart's romantic hits of the 1990s. If We Fall In Love Tonight, For the First Time, Have I Told You Lately and All For Love are some of those hits that are not available in any of Stewart's greatest hits albums. Stewart also included some revival songs for his version of When I need You (Leo Sayer) and Sometimes When We Touch (Dan Hill), which are also sensational. The rest are standard songs that can be found in his other albums especially in his Storyteller collection, which I also have. All in all, the dedication that is put in the creation of this album is outstanding. Stewart has made numerous hits and this collection narrows down to the romantic ballads of the past three decades. Nicely done.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Rod Stewart - If We Fall in Love Tonight\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Rod Stewart\nAlbum................: If We Fall in Love Tonight\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996 11 12\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 260kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
