Indeed, it was only a year later, when Revelation Records released the band's self-titled EP - their name derived from a lyric in the Misfits song &quot;Bullet&quot; - that Texas is the Reason were already headlining their own tours in America and well on their way to defining a new moment in post-punk.\n\n  In April of 1996, the band reinforced that initial success with their first and only album, produced by Jawbox's J. Robbins and named after the last words that John Lennon was alleged to have heard: &quot;Do You Know Who You Are?&quot; In the years since, Spin, Alternative Press, and Paste would all go on to call &quot;Do You Know Who You Are?&quot; an essential '90s album. Unfortunately, after a year of heavy promotion and touring for the record, inner-band tension came to a head, and Texas is the Reason officially split in 1997.\n\n  This new expanded version of Texas Is The Reason's groundbreaking album includes the last two songs the band wrote before splitting up, but had never released. These two songs, which fit right into the band's canon, were finally put to tape this year with &quot;Do You Know Who You Are?&quot; producer J. Robbins - making this, for the first time, a complete career retrospective.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074912502da72dd9a18ea104173e5796a0b60884","amp;dn":"Texas+is+the+Reason+-+Do+You+Know+Who+You+Are%3F+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074912502da72dd9a18ea104173e5796a0b60884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,73,18,80,45,167,45,217,161,142,161,4,23,62,87,150,160,182,8,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
