It answers those awkward but essential questions regarding how deep, how far apart, how to tend and care, and how - and when - to do this and that. This handy book is a practical manual that wants to spend most of its life in your pocket or in the garden shed, and to be consulted regularly throughout the seasons, just as you might turn to an experienced old friend for guidance and advice on edible gardening matters. The Pocket Guide to the Edible Garden holds in its pages the knowledge and the experience of author Joe Hashman (aka 'Dirty Nails' of the Blackmore Vale Magazine) condensed into clear, concise language and amplified by Helen Lanchbery's meticulous drawings.\n\n\nBy Joe Hashman\nPublished by Constable &amp; Robinson in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:506dd30e7fda8ec9c10327474a9dce93e218abd9","amp;dn":"Pocket+Guide+to+the+Edible+Garden%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"506dd30e7fda8ec9c10327474a9dce93e218abd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,109,211,14,127,218,142,201,193,3,39,71,74,157,206,147,226,24,171,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
