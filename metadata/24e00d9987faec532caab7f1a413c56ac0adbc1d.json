This book examines the principles of structure and bonding in complex solids. \r\nDivided into 13 parts, this volume begins with an overview of the development of atomic pseudopotentials and the discovery that they could be applied directly to atoms in crystals. This book then provides an understanding of other relevant topics, including ionic radii, bond strength, and bond length. Other chapters focus on the problems of classifying complex solids and describe the relationship between their structures. This text also describes the alloy structure to help know how compounds react or transform. This book further explores the geometrical relationships between different structure types in crystals. The final chapter deals with the contribution of Mooser and Pearson in the study of energy-band theory and chemical bonding. \r\nSolid-state physicists and chemists, geophysicists, metallurgists, and ceramists will find this book extremely useful","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e00d9987faec532caab7f1a413c56ac0adbc1d","amp;dn":"Structure+and+Bonding+in+Crystals+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e00d9987faec532caab7f1a413c56ac0adbc1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,224,13,153,135,250,236,83,44,170,183,241,164,19,197,106,192,173,188,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
