Explore fully-interactive realtime worlds, interacting with physics and roaming the wide-open, fright-filled environments.\n\nThis next-gen Alone in the Dark is also built around a unique episodic game structure -- the story is split into a number of distinct 30-40 minute episodes, doled out one at a time as you play. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb3679ffd3dd325cd617a9ece4435808e031cae","amp;dn":"Alone+in+the+Dark%3A+Inferno+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb3679ffd3dd325cd617a9ece4435808e031cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,179,103,159,253,61,211,37,205,97,122,158,206,68,53,128,142,3,28,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
