Two young brothers, who are the unquestioned alpha-males of fellow classmates in their suburban Tokyo neighborhood, are outraged by their father's clownish and subservient behavior at his office. As the film progresses, the children come to accept that their father is not a great man, as they imagined, and in the process, they lose some of their innocence. Ozu reworked this film for his 1959 opus Ohayo. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Umarete wa mita keredo.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 720 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate : 1 580 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.300\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.220\n      Stream size : 1.00 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 127 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 82.3 MiB (7%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 145 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17.6 --abr 128\n\nIMDB: tt0023634\n\nSilent, japanese intertitles; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nEclipse rip, posted at KG by unclemeat, who deserves the credits\n\nOzu - Umarete wa mita keredo (1932) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3e0531fab982701eaf1e7db1ce35ff9d433b77","amp;dn":"Ozu+-+Umarete+wa+mita+keredo+%281932%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3e0531fab982701eaf1e7db1ce35ff9d433b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,62,5,49,250,185,130,112,30,175,30,125,177,206,53,255,157,67,59,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
