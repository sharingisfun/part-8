It features an unforgettable performance by Rowan Atkinson as a total prick called Ron Anderson (Lovingly based on Richard Curtis' real-life experiences as &quot;The Other Man&quot; in Rowan's &quot;One-Man Shows&quot;) as well as boasting breakout performances by Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson (Including one of the most hilarious sex scenes ever filmed) and a... ahem... seminal soundtrack by Madness. Enjoy and spread your seed ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e637c6d55ff4d98864f2e59388c2492a93e6b4","amp;dn":"The+Tall+Guy+%281989%29+Jeff+Goldblum+Emma+Thompson+Rowan+Atkinson+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e637c6d55ff4d98864f2e59388c2492a93e6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,230,55,198,213,95,244,217,136,100,242,229,147,136,194,73,42,147,230,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
