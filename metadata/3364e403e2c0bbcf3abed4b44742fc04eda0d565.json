The album spawned three big hits (including &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;) and three Grammy awards and Nelly became an MTV favorite, recognized by a stylish band-aid on one cheek in the memory of his good friend City Spud, who he collaborated with on &quot;Ride Wit Me&quot;. His second effort, Nellyville, (2002) was equally successful. It included the hits &quot;Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; and was nominated for five Grammy awards, including Album of the Year. In 2004 Nelly released two albums at the same time, Sweat and Suit, and in September they briefly held the two top spots on the charts. Nelly has been equally active as a businessman; among other ventures, in 2003 he released his own energy drink called &quot;Pimp Juice,&quot; and in 2004 he became a minority owner of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats basketball team. He is also the CEO of Derrty Entertainment, his own company formed in 2003.\n\nExtra credit: Nelly has been publicly coy about his year of birth, and does not list it in his official biography; however, in 2003 a story in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported that he would celebrate his 25th birthday that year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3364e403e2c0bbcf3abed4b44742fc04eda0d565","amp;dn":"Nelly+-+Country+Grammar+V0+320kbs+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3364e403e2c0bbcf3abed4b44742fc04eda0d565","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,100,228,3,226,192,187,207,58,190,212,180,71,66,252,4,237,160,213,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
