His recruitment was simple and his legend is brilliant but un-earned. Somehow, he thinks he's the best there is and we all know how pride goeth before a fall.\n\nHere is a spy-tangled novel of undercover misadventure that goes from Paris to Venice by ways of intrigue that 007 never dreamed of--with semi-professional killers, submissive subversives &amp; a swinging Mata Hari from Hunter College. This is upmanship espionage at its funniest.\n\n&quot;Combines ironic wit with suspense to remarkable effect.&quot; --John Le Carre\n\n\nRead by Oliver Wyman\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c613f06a8d9a2cdf18016f46e9fcaa6ab4b78a","amp;dn":"Robert+Sheckley+-+The+Game+of+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c613f06a8d9a2cdf18016f46e9fcaa6ab4b78a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,198,19,240,106,141,154,44,223,24,1,111,70,233,252,170,106,180,183,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
