But life got in the way and, for more than 35 years, he's been unable to fulfil his ambition. Until now... thanks to two special one-hour films he presents in support of Sky Rainforest Rescue, Sky's partnership with WWF, which has helped save one billion trees in the Amazon rainforest. \r\nFilmed in the Brazilian rainforest, it charts Hammond's journey along the mighty Amazon River and deep into the jungle as he attempts to photograph the creatures that captivated him all those years ago. Along the way, he's treated to unique wildlife encounters as he enters the river with pink river dolphins and rescues an entangled sloth. It's not all plain sailing, though, as he battles heat, humidity and torrential rain. He also confronts personal phobias when he comes face-to-face with giant spiders, feels the wrath of bullet ants and must conquer his fear of heights when he is hoisted high into the forest canopy. \r\nEstimates suggest that, in the years since the eight-year-old Richard first dreamed of visiting the Amazon, approximately 20 per cent of the South American rainforest has been destroyed. Aiming to inspire a new generation to become guardians of this unique eco-system, Hammond plans to exhibit his photos at home for local schoolchildren. It's a noble quest, but with weather, photo opportunities and time stacked against him, can he deliver?\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nIn this first of two films, Hammond is on the mighty Amazon itself, leaving the main river to enter the flooded forest in tiny dug-out canoes. It soon becomes apparent that the inhabitants of the Amazon are not keen to play ball when Richard struggles to even see the creatures spotted by his guide Eduardo, let alone photograph them. However, hours of frustration are finally rewarded when Richard enjoys once-in-a-lifetime encounters with sloths and Pink River Dolphins.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nIn the last episode in this series which sees Richard making his way along the Amazon River and rainforest to fulfil a childhood dream and photograph their wildlife. Tonight he will be facing biting ants, overcoming a personal phobia when he comes face-to-face with giant spiders, and tries to conquer his fear of heights when he is hoisted high into the forest canopy. Hold up... giant spiders??!!\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d5/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a4/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/80/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5f/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/81/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e7/Jungle-Quest-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3523 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.09 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.sky.com/tv/show/richard-hammonds-jungle-quest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc2b1b61911baa1fc42dfc1108c7869e2340b32","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Richard+Hammonds+Jungle+Quest+Series+1+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc2b1b61911baa1fc42dfc1108c7869e2340b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,194,177,182,25,17,186,161,252,66,223,193,16,140,120,105,226,52,11,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
