There are of course many reasons for this, but here are just some...\r\n\r\nColoring Reduces Stress And Anxiety\r\n\r\nPsychiatrists have long recognized the fact that coloring relaxes the fear center of the brain and allows your mind to get some rest. In fact the founder of analytical psychology, Carl Jung, is known to have given his patients mandalas to color over one hundred years ago. In today's hectic world the stress reducing properties of coloring are possibly more valuable than ever.\r\n\r\nColoring Trains Your Mind To Focus\r\n\r\nStaying inside the lines as you color a simple black and white line drawing takes focus and, while you are concentrating on this stress-free and relaxing activity, you can forget about your worries. Coloring is a mental exercise which lets you put aside everything else for the time you spend coloring, and this is extremely important in our hectic world.\r\n\r\nColoring Helps To Develop Motor Skills And Vision\r\n\r\nColoring forces the two sides of the brain to interact and involves the use of logic (necessary for coloring forms) and creativity (as we mix and match colors). This, in turn, brings the areas of the brain concerned with vision and fine motor skills into play, and helps in keeping these active and in developing them further. It is this aspect of coloring which is being increasingly seen as particularly valuable for older individuals, as many professionals believe that it can delay, or even prevent, the onset of dementia.\r\n\r\nColoring Provides The Opportunity To Be Social\r\n\r\nAlthough you might feel that coloring would be a purely solo occupation, its growing popularity is fast turning it into a social one. Families, friends, colleagues and others are now getting together to enjoy something to eat and drink and the chance to socialize, through their common interest in coloring. Indeed, this is a perfect excuse for partying, as coloring needs only minimal concentration and can easily be done in a group.\r\n\r\nColoring Allows You To Be Yourself\r\n\r\nThere are no rules when it comes to coloring and your coloring book is just that - your coloring book. If you accidentally color the cat's rear leg green because you mistook it for part of the grass, who is going to care? Should you feel like making the sky yellow, does it really matter? You may be as creative and experimental as you wish because this is your coloring book, and yours alone.\r\n\r\nYou may of course already be a follower of adult coloring, in which case you will appreciate its value. Alternatively, this may be a new project for you and one which you are thinking about for any one of a number of different reasons. If this is something new for you then I encourage you to give it a try. It is no accident that so many people are fired up about the world of adult coloring, so join in and start to enjoy the benefits for yourself today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee15dd2f085c73a6c4cfffe178a2b717cea922a1","amp;dn":"Mandala+Circles-50+Mind+Calming+And+Stress+Relieving+Patterns+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee15dd2f085c73a6c4cfffe178a2b717cea922a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,21,221,47,8,92,115,166,196,207,255,225,120,162,183,23,206,169,34,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
