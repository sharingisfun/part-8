A large musical influence to him \ncame from High Contrast's 'Gold Digger' remix.\n\nIn late 2009, Netsky signed a recording contract with Hospital Records, the same label as other well known liquid artists such as High Contrast \nand London Elektricity.\n\nIn less than 12 months, the Belgian musician secured releases with record labels including Liq-Weed Ganja, Spearhead and Talkin Beatz.\n He also won a nomination as &quot;Best Upcoming Producer&quot; within just months of his first release at the Drum + Bass Arena Awards.\n\nNetsky is now signed exclusively to Hospital, and has also appeared on the Hospital Podcast.\n\nNetsky is the self-titled first album from Belgian drum &amp; bass musician Netsky. The album primarily features drum and bass tracks, with various vocalists \nsuch as Darrison and Jenna G.\n\n======================================\n\n  Vinyl Tracklist\n\n1. \t&quot;Escape&quot; (feat.
