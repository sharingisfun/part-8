A few are pdf only.\n\n---\n\nMany thanks to the original uploaders.\n\n---\n\n\nThe torrent does NOT include (for example) The Ratzinger Report, Salt of the Earth, God and the World, or God Is Near Us. If they turn up, I'll post them later.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793e23497b8f8544a384f64ba17935b280896afc","amp;dn":"Joseph+Ratzinger+-+Pope+Benedict+XVI+-+82+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793e23497b8f8544a384f64ba17935b280896afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,62,35,73,123,143,133,68,163,132,246,75,161,121,53,178,128,137,106,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
