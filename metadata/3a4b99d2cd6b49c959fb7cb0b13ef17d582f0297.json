The game's plot, which will mirror the film's, will find you attempting to discover exactly what's behind the seemingly random, mystical events that are bringing demons into our world (hint: it's nothing good). Over the course of the investigation, you'll discover the larger, more ominous implications of the events and have to deal with the mysterious and deadly Mammon.\n\ntorrent downloaded from demoniod","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4b99d2cd6b49c959fb7cb0b13ef17d582f0297","amp;dn":"Constantine+ps2+Ntsc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4b99d2cd6b49c959fb7cb0b13ef17d582f0297","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,75,153,210,205,107,73,201,89,251,124,176,177,62,241,125,88,47,2,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
