This series, along with Richard GarriottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ultima, was among the most important and influential RPG series of all time, and spawned a number of spin-off series, most noticeably the greatest turn-based strategy series of all time: Heroes of Might and Magic.\n\nThis torrent contains the entire ORIGINAL Might and Magic Series, created before 3DO went under. See how it all began!\n\nGames 1-5 are included in The Ultimate Might And Magic Archives. This includes the &quot;World of Xeen&quot; game, which is automatically created when you install Clouds of Xeen and Dark Side of Xeen.\n\nGanes 4-7 are included in Might and Magic Millennium edition.\n\nGames 8 and 9 are included individually.\n\nFor the completists out there, I have even included scans of the original inserts (except for Millennium edition, which just came in a box with white sleeves).\n\nNote: some of these games date back to the 80's and were written for DOS. Getting them to play on a modern machine can be a royal pain in the ass. The best way to have the true experience is to get on eBay and toss together some old parts to make a DOS box. An easier and cheaper option OS to create a virtual machine using VMWare or Virtual PC. \n\nApparently, a lot of people had problems with the later games in my first torrent. This was because I encoded them in .ISO format, not realizing that they were hybrid game/audio discs, which the .ISO format does not support. This torrent contains all the discs in .bin/.cue format, which should work in most programs, including Daemon tools, Roxio, Nero, ISO Buster, Magic ISO and Power ISO.\n\nMy upload speed sucks, so do the community a favor: Download ALL of this torrent (even if you only want one of the games), and then seed, seed, seed! \n\nAnd remember the law of ethical P2P: Pay for what you can find and afford. Download what you cannot. Share it all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b44efd186ed3d1ba608851bb74359027a7c63f3","amp;dn":"Might+and+Magic+-+The+Complete+3DO+Collection+%2AFixed%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b44efd186ed3d1ba608851bb74359027a7c63f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,68,239,209,134,237,61,27,166,8,133,27,183,67,89,2,122,124,99,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
