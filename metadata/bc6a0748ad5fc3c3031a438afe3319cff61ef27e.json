It focuses on advanced techniques and methods that allow a refined extraction and processing of information, allowing efficient and effective decision making that would not be possible with classical techniques. The Author, fellow of IEEE for Pioneering contributions to time-frequency analysis and signal processing education, is an expert in the field, having written over 300 papers on the subject over a period pf 25 years.\nThis is a REAL book, not a mere collection of specialised papers, making it essential reading for researchers and practitioners in the field of signal processing.\n\n*The most comprehensive text and reference book published on the subject, all the most up to date research on this subject in one place\n*Key computer procedures and code are provided to assist the reader with practical implementations and applications\n*This book brings together the main knowledge of time-frequency signal analysis and processing, (TFSAP), from theory and applications, in a user-friendly reference suitable for both experts and beginners ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc6a0748ad5fc3c3031a438afe3319cff61ef27e","amp;dn":"Time+Frequency+Signal+Analysis+and+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc6a0748ad5fc3c3031a438afe3319cff61ef27e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,106,7,72,173,95,195,195,3,26,67,138,254,51,25,207,246,30,242,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
