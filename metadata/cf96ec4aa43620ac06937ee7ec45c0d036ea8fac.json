It was imprinted in our culture by the moving images from the Vietnam War were it changed the face of warfare. And it never left as thousands are still flying in every corner of the world.\nFifty years after it first flew it is still in production and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something no other helicopter can claim. The characteristic sound of the two-bladed rotor can be heard over jungles and city centers. Even though it has only one engine it is very reliable and rugged. A workhorse thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not afraid to get dirty and will fly just as happy with a few pounds more than the manual states it can carry.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s loved by the pilots and the crew that maintain the old airframes. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Huey.\n\nFeatures:\nIncludes military UH-1H (or German UH-1D) and civilian Bell 205 A-1 models\nHighly accurate flight model (using a separate module to correct the limited helicopter flight model of FSX).
