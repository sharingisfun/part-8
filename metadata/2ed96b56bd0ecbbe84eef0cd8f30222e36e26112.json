With each episode telling a strong, specific and factual story, Secrets of War has become an instant classic offering the most historically accurate complete guide in the 20th Century ever produced.\nNarrated by Oscar award-winner Charlton Heston, this series brings to life the conflicts that pulsed through the battles behind the battlefields. Uncover the strong, specific and factual tactics used by history's most influential leaders.\n\n\n1)  The French Resistance \nThe Nazi Germany invasion of France inflicted humiliation on the French. Risking torture and death, brave individuals took it upon themselves to reclaim the honor of their country and carried on a secret, merciless guerrilla campaign. From attacks in the streets of Paris, to armed battles with German soldiers, these are the stories of the French resistance.\n\n2)  Japan the Invasion that Never Was \nThe secret US plan for the invasion of Japan was shrouded in secrecy. It was anticipated to be the most horrific battle of the war with hundreds of thousands of casualties. New revelations detail manipulated casualty figures and secret plans to stockpile gas weapons as the US prepared for hell on Earth.\n\n3)  The Battle of Britain \nJune 1940: England stands alone against brutal aggression. The Germans have yet to be stopped in their lightening thrust across Europe. The British are outnumbered, but they have a secret weapon four years in the making. There were only 500 RAF fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain, but behind them, deep in the shadows of war, over 10,000 special men and women fought the battle of Ultra, which helped make victory possible.\n\n4)  Hirohito's War \nJapanese tradition made him a god, but Japanese law made him Commander in Chief of the Japanese Armed Forces. Never tried for war crimes or even interrogated, Hirohito was an enigmatic figure from Pearl Harbor to his secret role in the surrender of Japan.\n\n5)  Mussolini's Henchman \nThis is an inside look at fascist Italy starting with Mussolini's rise to power, the unknown stories of the shadowy figures who protected Il Duce and the tenuous Axis relationship with Nazi Germany.\n\n6)  Gulf War Steel Rain \nThey were the best kept secrets of the air campaign in the Gulf War. The controversial strategic plan to wipe out Iraqi targets, the classified missions of airborne spy planes and the clever deception that used harmless decoys to overwhelm Baghdad's air defense network.\n\n7)  Gulf War Secrets in the Sand \nThe real stories of Secret Operations behind enemy lines in the Gulf War. The German undercover agent who worked for Iraq, the secret roll of the U-2 spy plane and the hunt for mobile scud missile launchers.\n\n8)  Gulf War Architects of Desert Storm \nWe look at the top-secret planning behind the Coalition's victory over Iraq. How former CIA director President George Bush, General Norman Schwarzkopf, General Colin Powell and others gathered and analysed the crucial information needed to develop their deceptive and overwhelming battlefield strategy in the Persian Gulf.\n\n9)  Gulf War Iraq's Secrets \nSaddam Hussein used cunning and deception to befriend the West. Then he turned his back. He has risked everything to secretly develop his weapons of mass destruction, including the welfare of his own people\n\n10)  The Invasion of Panama \nUntold stories behind the boldest US military strike since Vietnam, the surprise invasion of Panama in December 1989. The secret buildup to the attack, the classified mission by Special Forces to rescue an American hostage and the manhunt for a dictator who pushed his luck too far.\n\n11)  Mao's Secrets \nThe roots of China's conflict with Taiwan go back to WWII. While the Allied and Axis powers battled for control of Europe, China's Chiang Kai-Shek and his US-backed State Police fought a bloody secret war against Mao Tse-tung's Soviet trained and financed army.\n\n12)  Shadows of the Six Day War \nIt was a battle no one really wanted, and a victory far greater than anyone expected. Israel, outnumbered and outgunned, fought the Six Day War on the field of espionage. Secret agents crafted an ingenious plan to capture a Russian jet and prepared for a daring first strike.\n\n13)  Israeli Intelligence \nIn a constant war of survival, the state of Israel commissioned super sleuths for military intelligence, kidnappings, assassinations and hostage rescues. From retributions against ex-Nazis after WWII to the establishment of the Mossad, an inside look at Israeli intelligence.\n\n14)  Korea: Behind the Bamboo Curtain \nThe hidden factors behind the first conflict of the Cold War. Newly discovered documents reveal Stalin's influence over China's Mao Tse Tung and Korea's Kim El Sung. The intelligence failures of MacArthur's most trusted aides and the strings being pulled by the world's superpowers.\n\n15)  Spies in the Sky \nThis is an examination of the secret deployment of modern aircraft designed to spy from the sky. From remotely piloted vehicles on today's battlefield to the venerable U-2 and the SR-71, spy planes have long been the most vital top covert aircraft in the sky.\n\n16)  Prisoners of War Part I \nExamines the treatment of prisoners of war early in the 20th century. From capture to interrogation and internment, the fate of thousands of WWI prisoners was determined by their captors off the battlefield.\n\n17)  Prisoners of War Part II \nExamines the treatment of prisoners of war on both sides during WWII. From interrogation to housing to repatriation, civilian and military POWs were often used as pawns between warring nations.\n\n18)  Prisoners of War Part III \nFrom brainwashing in Korea to courageous acts of heroism in Vietnam and the Gulf War, this is a unique examination of POWs, their families and their secrets.\n\n19)  The Balkans Tinderbox \nThis is a look at the secret forces behind the strife throughout the Balkan States. From a single gunshot in Sarajevo that started WWI to the Nazi occupation in WWII, to ethnic cleansing and the war in Kosovo, this volatile region has long been a threat to the peace of Europe.\n\n20)  WWI Germanys Secret Gambles \nAs the armies of World War One struggled under a barrage of terrifying weapons, the German government turned to covert operations to break the stalemate. Sabotage, biological weapons and top-secret communications ushered in a new era of warfare.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nclick on the thumbnails below to get full-size images &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/a9456ac1a7b529c33b3dc9802f15b9f1facfc5f6.jpg&quot;
