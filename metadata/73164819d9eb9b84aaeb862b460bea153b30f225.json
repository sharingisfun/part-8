Automotive photographer Will Shiers has captured these dreams on film for over ten years, and this volume collects his images between two covers for the first time. Here are the beautiful husks Shiers has found in the United States fields and barns, shops, and salvage yards across States. Divided into five categoriesÃ¢â‚¬â€General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Independents, and Special VehiclesÃ¢â‚¬â€these wrecks and relics from 1910 to the 1970s come equipped with all the relevant information: history, model, location. The most comprehensive and beautifully photographed collection of abandoned cars ever published, this volume preserves for all time the exquisite skeletons of American automotive might.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73164819d9eb9b84aaeb862b460bea153b30f225","amp;dn":"Roadside+Relics+%28Cars+US+History+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73164819d9eb9b84aaeb862b460bea153b30f225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,22,72,25,217,235,155,132,170,235,134,43,70,11,234,21,59,48,242,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
