Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe that you must be able to draw things as you see themÃ¢â‚¬â€realistically,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ wrote Rudy de Reyna in his introduction. Today, generations of artists have learned to draw what they see, to truly capture the world around them, using de ReynaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods. How to Draw What You See shows artists how to recognize the basic shape of an objectÃ¢â‚¬â€cube, cylinder, cone, or sphereÃ¢â‚¬â€and use that shape to draw the object, no matter how much detail it contains.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb99480f614b4bfb4b8719ad73a4bc9f0d95017","amp;dn":"HOW+TO+DRAW+WHAT+YOU+SEE+%28epub%29+-+Rudy+de+Reyna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb99480f614b4bfb4b8719ad73a4bc9f0d95017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,185,148,128,246,20,180,191,180,184,113,154,215,58,75,201,240,217,80,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
