Despite this the enigmatic and mystical Nemesis treats his role as that of a player in a massive cosmic game. A game he intends to win.\nArmed with his sword Excessus (the Sword Sinister), he can fight using both bursts of high intensity flame or by hurling acid balls at his opponents.\nAlthough not a robot and not an official member, Nemesis has fought with the ABC Warriors, and briefly replaced Deadlock in their ranks and even appeared in his own strip, many years in the future with Ro-Jaws as his vallet.\n\n\nCreated by Pat Mills, Nemesis debuted in British science fiction and fantasy anthology comic 2000AD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80772968efcf2d1f5e6fb990c4b86506606700ea","amp;dn":"Nemesis+the+Warlock+%28Books+0+-+10+%2B+Extras%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80772968efcf2d1f5e6fb990c4b86506606700ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,119,41,104,239,207,45,31,94,111,185,144,196,184,101,6,96,103,0,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
