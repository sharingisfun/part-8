Breakfast reveals a surprising legacy of British rule, and the bikers are sent on their way with a traditional Chinese good luck ceremony.\n\n2)  Thailand Bangkok and the Central Plains \nThe Hairy Bikers arrive in Thailand, where people say it is impossible to eat badly. They are in Bangkok and the central plains, where much of the Thai cuisine we are familiar with comes from. Here they discover why Bangkok is the street food capital of the world and they help serve up some school dinners, Thai style. Heading out of Bangkok, they join some paddy field workers and find out how rice is grown.\n\n3)  Thailand Beaches and Mountains \nThe Hairy Bikers travel to the beaches of the south and the mountains of the north to discover how Thailand's multicultural history and its place at the heart of the spice trade has created a rich and varied cuisine. They meet a coconut-picking monkey, head out to sea during the monsoon for what turns out to be a rather nerve-wracking fishing expedition, and they cook their own jungle curry for a remote hill tribe.\n\n4)  Japan Tokyo \nJapanese is the Hairy Bikers' all-time favourite food and they fulfil a lifetime's ambition to visit this incredible country. Si finds himself a bit lost in translation at a manga cafe when he has to wear kitty ears. Dave and Si discover the ultimate sushi at Tokyo's famous fish market and have the rare privilege of spending time in a sumo stable, where they take part in a wrestling bout.\n\n5)  Japan South to Kyoto \nThe bikers head off into the heart of traditional Japan to find out the historic roots of Japanese cuisine. Dave puts his fancy footwork into action kneading noodle dough the artisan way, they take an awe-inspiring bike ride to see Mount Fuji, spend a night at a Buddhist temple and are entertained by one of Kyoto's geisha, complete with traditional drinking games.\n\n6)  South Korea \nKorean food is set to be the next big thing in the UK so the bikers want to find out what's coming our way. On a night out with some young Seoulites, they discover a cuisine that doesn't pull any punches when it comes to flavour, including Korean BBQ and fried chicken. Si discovers he has a natural gift for the Korean national sport, archery, while Dave brushes up on his Gangnam-style dancing.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4c04252b240c0078627d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2020 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 920 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vp3tt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03vp3tt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00fb532d3e1a7869bb65cffdf9d4618eb77749e3","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Hairy+Bikers+Asian+Adventure+2of6+Thailand+Bangkok+and+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00fb532d3e1a7869bb65cffdf9d4618eb77749e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,251,83,45,62,26,120,105,187,101,207,253,249,212,97,142,183,119,73,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
