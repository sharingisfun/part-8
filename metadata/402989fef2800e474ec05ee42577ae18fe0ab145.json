Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released on September 23, 1970, in the United States by Atco Records and Capricorn Records.\n\nFollowing the release of their 1969 debut, the Allman Brothers Band toured the United States extensively to promote the album, which barely made a dent on pop charts. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth coverage that extended to more famous musicians, such as Eric Clapton, who called upon group leader Duane Allman to contribute to his 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.\n\nDue mostly to the band's relentless touring schedule, Idlewild South was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including New York, Miami, and Macon, Georgia, the band's home. Tom Dowd had previously been arranged to record the group's debut but was unavailable. The material presented on Idlewild South was written during this period and tested out on the road at shows. The album's title comes from the band's nickname for a ramshackle, remote cabin the band rented out and used for rehearsals, as well as wild parties. Idlewild South contains two of the band's best-known songs, &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; (later a hit for various artists) and &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot;, which became one of the band's famous concert numbers.\n\nThe album was released in September 1970 but again failed to connect commercially. Sales began to grow, however, due to the band's touring schedule (they played over 300 shows in 1970), setting the stage for their artistic and commercial breakthrough with their follow-up, 1971's live album At Fillmore East.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Revival&quot; (Dickey Betts)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:05\n    &quot;Don't Keep Me Wonderin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n    &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; (Allman, Robert Payne)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; (Betts)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:56\n    &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot; (Willie Dixon)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\n    &quot;Please Call Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:02\n    &quot;Leave My Blues at Home&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band\n\n    Duane Allman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ slide guitar, lead guitar, acoustic guitar\n    Dickey Betts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\n    Gregg Allman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, organ, piano\n    Berry Oakley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, vocals on &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;\n    Jai Johanny Johanson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, congas, timbales, percussion\n    Butch Trucks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, timpani\n\nAdditional Musicians\n\n    Thom Doucette Ã¢â‚¬â€œ harmonica, percussion\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402989fef2800e474ec05ee42577ae18fe0ab145","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+Band+-+Idlewild+South+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402989fef2800e474ec05ee42577ae18fe0ab145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,41,137,254,242,128,14,71,78,192,94,228,37,119,174,24,254,10,177,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
