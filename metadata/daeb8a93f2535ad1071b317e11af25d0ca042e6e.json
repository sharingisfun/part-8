But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead Ã¢â‚¬Å“checking outÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s embarked on a complex analysis of the customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore.\n\nWith irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan has crafted a literary adventure story for the twenty-first century, evoking both the fairy-tale charm of Haruki Murakami and the enthusiastic novel-of-ideas wizardry of Neal Stephenson or a young Umberto Eco, but with a unique and feisty sensibility thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rare to the world of literary fiction. Mr. PenumbraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 24-Hour Bookstore is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave, a modern-day cabinet of wonders ready to give a jolt of energy to every curious reader, no matter the time of day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daeb8a93f2535ad1071b317e11af25d0ca042e6e","amp;dn":"Mr.+Penumbra%27s+24-Hour+Bookstore+-+Robin+Sloan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daeb8a93f2535ad1071b317e11af25d0ca042e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,235,138,147,242,83,90,209,7,27,49,126,17,175,37,208,202,4,46,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
