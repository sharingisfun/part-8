E. Johns.\nHe first appeared in the story &quot;The White Fokker&quot;, published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine, in 1932. The first collection of Biggles stories, The Camels are Coming, was published that same year. The series was continued until the author's death in 1968, eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including novels and short story collections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most, but not all, of the latter with a common setting and time frame.\nWhile the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain adolescent boys, in the First World War Biggles stories Johns paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat Ã¢â‚¬â€ when pilots often died in their first combat and before devices such as respirators and parachutes had become practical. \n\n\n\n1 Biggles - Charter Pilot 1943\n2 Biggles in Borneo 1943\n3 Biggles Fails to Return 1943\n4 Biggles Delivers the Goods 1946\n5 Biggles in the Orient 1945\n6 Sergent Bigglesworth C.I.D 1947\n7 Biggles Second Case 1948\n8 Another Job For Biggles 1948\n9 Biggles Hunts Big Game 1948\n10 Biggles Takes A Holiday 1949\n11 Biggles Breaks The Silence 1949\n12 Biggles Gets His Men 1950\n13 Biggles Follows On 1952\n14 Biggles Air Detective 1950\n15 Biggles Works It Out 1951\n16 Biggles Takes The Case 1952\n17 Biggles and the Black Raider 1953\n18 Biggles in the Gobi 1953\n19 No Rest For Biggles 1956\n20 Biggles Pioneer Air Fighter 1954\n21 Biggles of 266 1956\n22 Biggles &amp; the Deep Blue Sea 1968\n23 The Camels Are Coming 1932\n24 Cruise of the Condor 1933\n25 Biggles of the Camel Squadron 1934\n26 Biggles Flies Again 1934\n27 Biggles and the Black Peril 1935\n28 Biggles Learns to Fly 1935\n29 Biggles Hits The Trail 1935\n30 Biggles Flies East 1935\n31 Biggles and Co. 1936\n32 Biggles Air Commodore 1937\n33 Biggles Flies West 1937\n34 Biggles Goes to War 1938\n35 Biggles Flies South 1938\n36 Biggles Flies North 1939\n37 Biggles and the Rescue Flight 1939\n38 Biggles in Spain 1939\n39 Biggles Secret Agent 1940\n40 Biggles in the Baltic 1940\n41 Biggles in the South Seas 1940\n42 Biggles Defies the Swastika 1941\n43 Biggles Sees it Through 1941\n44 Spitfire Parade 1941\n45 Biggles in the Jungle 1942\n46 Biggles Sweeps the Desert 1942\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ce1075f7b225b9f3308fc2044b5289e4f4e982d","amp;dn":"46+Biggles+books+by+Captain+WE+Johns%2C+Epub%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ce1075f7b225b9f3308fc2044b5289e4f4e982d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,225,7,95,123,34,91,159,51,8,252,32,68,181,40,158,79,78,152,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
