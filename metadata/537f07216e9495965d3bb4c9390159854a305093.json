Dae-ho, the manager of the building and single father, is forced to cancel plans with his daughter Hana to work the event. His Christmas is saved when Yoon-hee, the food mall manager with a secret crush on Dae-ho, offers to babysit Hana during the party. Meanwhile, Young-ki the legendary fire chief of Yoido Station has finally promised his first holiday date night to his long suffering wife. The party is in full swing with the spectacular sight of two helicopters flying overhead just to spray snow on the partygoers and make everything perfect. When unthinkable disaster strikes, Dae-ho and Young-ki must summon all their strength and courage to save the lives of thousands but at what cost to themselves and their loved ones?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537f07216e9495965d3bb4c9390159854a305093","amp;dn":"The+Tower+%282012%29+BluRay+1080p+5.1CH+x264+SmallAndHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537f07216e9495965d3bb4c9390159854a305093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,127,7,33,110,148,149,150,93,59,180,201,57,1,89,133,74,48,80,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
