Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wanted to put something out that showcased my production, writing and playing in the genre that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m known for, which is melodic, hard rock. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when I decided to start what I consider to be my rock side project, Joel HoekstraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 13.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAccompanying the guitarist in his new venture are vocalists Jeff Scott Soto (Journey, Talisman) and Russell Allan (Symphony X, Adrenaline Mob), bassist Tony Franklin (Blue Murder, The Firm), drummer Vinny Appice (Black Sabbath) and keyboardist Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater, Black Country Communion).\n\n1.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have a project thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s with Russell Allan on vocals from Adrenaline Mob and Symphony X, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tony Franklin on bass from The Firm and Blue Murder, and Vinny Appice on drums, of course from Black Sabbath and Dio,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he explained.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Derrick Sherinian on keys from Dream Theater and Joe Bonamassa. Jeff Scott Soto actually sang the backups on there, too. So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m considering Jeff an honorary member of the band because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over-qualified to be a backup singer. (laughs) But yeah, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m really looking forward to that getting out.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“That is something that I wrote everything on. I wrote all of the songs and all the lyrics and all the melodies and the whole nine yards. For anybody that wants to hear my writing, if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re disappointed thenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ (laughs) If you were disappointed that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing covers on the Whitesnake album, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to hear what my writing is like on there.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJoel HoekstraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 13 will release their debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœDying to LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on October 16 through Frontiers Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0994dd6ef9f29000672a17aa51d38806029de0a4","amp;dn":"Joel+Hoekstra%2F+Russell+Allan++-+Anymore+%28Single%292015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0994dd6ef9f29000672a17aa51d38806029de0a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,148,221,110,249,242,144,0,103,42,23,170,81,211,136,6,2,157,224,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
