However, the &quot;Never You Change&quot; found on this set is not the trio's original ska hit, but a reggae-fied remake. The rest of the album pulls directly from the anthology, with the disc divided almost evenly between the trio and a solo Hibbert's pre- and post-Island career. \r\nThus, for those who prefer the Maytals' ska and/or reggae hits, this is not the collection for you, as there are much better compilations of those periods. But for fans looking for a larger overview of both the band and Hibbert himself, this is an excellent place to start. (AMG)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/OxXFP3i.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
