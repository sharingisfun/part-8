Insight Meditation\nFind a comfortable place to sit for 45 to 60 minutes. It helps to sit at the same time and in the same place every day, and it doesnÃƒÂ¢??t have to be a silent place. Experiment until you find the situation you feel best in. You can sit once or twice a day, but donÃƒÂ¢??t sit for at least an hour after eating or before sleeping.\nItÃƒÂ¢??s important to sit with your back and head straight. Your eyes should be closed and the body as still as possible. A meditation bench can help, or a straight-backed chair or any arrangement of cushions.\nThere is no special breathing technique; ordinary, natural breathing is fine. Vipassana is based on the awareness of the breath, so the rise and fall of each breath should be watched, wherever the sensation is felt most clearly ÃƒÂ¢?? at the nose or in the area of the stomach or solar plexus.\n\nVipassana is not concentration and it is not an objective to remain watching the breathing for a whole hour. When thoughts, feelings or sensations arise, or when you become aware of sound, smells and breezes from outside, simply allow the attention to go to them. Whatever comes up can be watched as clouds passing in the sky ÃƒÂ¢?? you neither cling nor reject. Whenever there is a choice of what to watch, return to awareness of breathing.\nRemember, nothing special is meant to happen. There is neither success nor failure ÃƒÂ¢?? nor is there any improvement. There is nothing to figure out or analyse, but insights may come about anything. Questions and problems may just be seen as mysteries to be enjoyed.\n\nread more in text..\n\nfind more ...Osho talk on Vipassana...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c85247554f30f8c8bbfc30d2a1f5058914f52b2f","amp;dn":"Osho+-+Vipassana_meditation_all","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c85247554f30f8c8bbfc30d2a1f5058914f52b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,82,71,85,79,48,248,200,187,252,48,210,161,245,5,137,20,245,43,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
