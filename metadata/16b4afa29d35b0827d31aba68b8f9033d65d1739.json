Some of them, like &quot;Observations on the Cooperative Movement,&quot; have not been published previously. Others, like &quot;The Idea of Liberty Is Western,&quot; have already made their mark on intellectual history.\n\nBrought together by Mrs. Mises after her husband's death, and edited with an introduction by Richard Ebeling, this volume fills an important gap in providing an overview of Ludwig von Mises's best academic work. For that reason, this book is already widely used in graduate courses and seminars on the resurgence of the Austrian School.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b4afa29d35b0827d31aba68b8f9033d65d1739","amp;dn":"Money%2C+Method%2C+and+the+Market+Process+-+Ludwig+von+Mises.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b4afa29d35b0827d31aba68b8f9033d65d1739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,180,175,162,157,53,176,130,125,49,171,166,139,143,144,51,214,93,23,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
