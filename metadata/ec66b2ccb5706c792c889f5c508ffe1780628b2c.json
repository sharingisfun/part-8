This makes it possible to synchronize the contents of different SIM cards when you switch from one mobile network to another.\n\nSynchronization is further extended by SIM ManagerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to export the contacts of a SIM to a CSV file, which can be loaded by a mail-client, or a PIM application. Now you can synchronize your Outlook address-book with the phonebook of your SIM, merge the contacts of your phone and PDA, etc.\n\nSIM Manager is a Unicode application, meaning that it can correctly process names and texts that contain characters other than the ones in the Latin alphabet, regardless of the current regional settings of Windows. It makes this GSM, 3G and Nextel SIM card editor suitable for enterprises that have offices in different geographical locations, as traveling from one cultural area to another is now less of a problem.\n\nSIM Manager works directly with the SIM card, using a PC/SC-compliant smart card reader. The program does not require a phone; therefore it is a fact that the solution still works after the phone is upgraded, or when a switch to a different mobile operator is made. There is no need to purchase a special data-cable for your phone either. All of the above-mentioned makes SIM Manager a great one-time investment. \n\nHighlights:\n\n    * Synchronize contacts between phones within an enterprise, regardless of which carrier different persons use, or which phone brand or model they prefer;\n    * Synchronize the contacts of the SIM card with the contacts stored in the address book of an email client (ex: Outlook, Lotus Notes, Eudora) or a desktop PIM application (ex: Palm Desktop), this is achieved by exporting / importing the data using CSV files;\n    * Backup a SIM card in order to easily restore the data if the card is lost, or if you simply need a copy of the card's contents;\n    * Multiply a SIM card ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ SIM Manager's efficient batch processing capabilities enable you to copy the contents of a SIM to one or more cards without any manual labour.
