Consisting of two extended works, his mixture of electronics and church organ with assorted winds and percussion, conjures up visions of the celestial light. Deeply emotional and filled with mysticism, this album marked the dawning of new age music, and still today is a wonder to behold.\n\nOriginally just with 2 tracks and now for the first time with more than 20 additional minutes, by adding 2 previously unreleased Moog bonus tracks of 1970/1971. \n\nThis has been a cult album and will become a new one.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1247adf7159dddb8f2176e683650381efcb775","amp;dn":"Popol+Vuh+-+In+den+G%26auml%3Brten+Pharaos+1971+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1247adf7159dddb8f2176e683650381efcb775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,18,71,173,247,21,157,221,184,242,23,110,104,54,80,56,30,252,183,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
