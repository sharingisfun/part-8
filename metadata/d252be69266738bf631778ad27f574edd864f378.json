All organisations, the executives who direct them, the employees who create value and their stakeholders who influence them, all interact and can impact corporate reputation. In a 24/7 media environment, where even a tweet can shape impressions, the importance of reputation management has never been higher. Every single move, decision taken and each isolated event that involves a company or public figure, is scrutinised, documented and publicised globally, compounding the task of reputation managers. Just ask BP, Toyota or Tiger Woods.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d252be69266738bf631778ad27f574edd864f378","amp;dn":"Corporate+Reputation%2C+Brand+and+Communication+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d252be69266738bf631778ad27f574edd864f378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,82,190,105,38,103,56,191,99,23,120,173,39,245,116,237,216,100,243,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
