In The Library Of Force (5:56)\n\nThis an album for days when you just feel unable to get out of bed and life has yanked your hair as a prelude to kneeing you in the balls. Music For a New Society is John CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last great album before a parade of underwhelming efforts.\nMusic For a new Society is CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most sparse and single-minded record as it is just CaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice, piano, minimal percussion, eerie electronics and the occasional bagpipe solo. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Keep a Close Watch on this Heart of MineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of the most heartwrenching portraits of a man who has been burned too many times.\nMusic For a New Society may be one of my favorite albums, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one that I dust off often because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so full of bad juju.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cbea0ed151eabf13949fca7939627dbb88c44cc","amp;dn":"John+Cale+-+Music+For+A+New+Society+%5B1982%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cbea0ed151eabf13949fca7939627dbb88c44cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,190,160,237,21,30,171,241,57,73,252,167,147,150,39,219,184,140,68,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
