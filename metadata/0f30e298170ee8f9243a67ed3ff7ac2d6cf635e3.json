He is the author of five bestselling short-story collections which have been translated into twenty-nine languages.  Four of them are included here.\n\nKeret has received the Prime Minister's award for literature, as well as the Ministry of Culture's Cinema Prize. In 2006 he was chosen as an outstanding artist of the prestigious Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation.  In 2010 he was awarded the Chevalier medallion of France's Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\n\nKeret has also written a number of award-winning screenplays.  &quot;Jellyfish&quot; (Israel, 2007) -- the first film that he co-directed with his wife Shira Geffen -- won the Camera d'Or prize for best first feature at Cannes.  The 2006 film, &quot;Wristcutters: A Love Story&quot;, is a dark comedy/love story based on Keret's KNELLER'S HAPPY CAMPERS about a young man who commits suicide and goes on a quest for love in the afterlife.\n\nKeret's voice is unique in contemporary fiction; you will not soon forget it.\n\n\nAll the following short story collections are in EPUB format:\n\n* THE GIRL ON THE FRIDGE (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2008).  Translated by Miriam Shlesinger and Sondra Silverston.\n\n* KNELLER'S HAPPY CAMPERS (Chatto &amp; Windus, 2009).  Translated by Miriam Shlesinger.\n\n* THE NIMROD FLIPOUT (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2006).  Translated by Miriam Shlesinger and Sondra Silverston.\n\n* SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2012).  Translated by Miriam Shlesinger, Sondra Silverston and Nathan Englander.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Stories that are short, strange, funny, deceptively casual in tone and affect, stories that sound like a joke but aren't -- Etgar Keret is a writer to be taken seriously.&quot; -- Yann Martel\n\n&quot;Etgar KeretÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short stories are fierce, funny, full of energy and insight, and at the same time often deep, tragic, and very moving.&quot; -- Amos Oz\n\n&quot;KeretÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories are strangely compelling, or compelling in their strangeness. The Israeli author blends KafkaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eeriness, fairy-tale wonder, and the absurdity of everyday life.&quot; -- Anat Rosenberg\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f30e298170ee8f9243a67ed3ff7ac2d6cf635e3","amp;dn":"Etgar+Keret+-+Short+Stories+%284+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f30e298170ee8f9243a67ed3ff7ac2d6cf635e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,48,226,152,23,14,232,249,36,58,103,237,63,247,172,45,108,246,53,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
