Not sure if anyone would still want to see this movie (maybe thats why i didn't find it), but we will find out!\n\nThis is my first movie, and it's a rip from Laser Disc, so it's not perfect.  It looks funny in some parts, but watchable. The LD copy I have of Human Highway is mint.  Played it on a Poineer CLD-V101, dubbed it to a Sony RDR-VX511 DVD Recorder on the highest quality setting, then ripped to the AVI files you see here. There are two AVI files to represent Side 1 and Side 2.  Any suggestions?  Please leave a comment!\n\nWikipedia page on the movie:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Highway&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Highway&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRemember to seed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65d89518ffd68d063902565a8eef80c46d4f9166","amp;dn":"Human+Highway+%28Neil+Young%2C+DEVO%2C+Dennis+Hopper+1982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65d89518ffd68d063902565a8eef80c46d4f9166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,216,149,24,255,214,141,6,57,2,86,90,142,239,128,196,109,79,145,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
