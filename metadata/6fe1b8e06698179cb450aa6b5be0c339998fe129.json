The music was produced as a collaboration between Iwai, Salyu, a musician who had not debuted yet, and Takeshi Kobayashi, a music producer who had previously worked with Iwai on the soundtrack to his 1996 film Swallowtail Butterfly. Iwai supplied the lyrics of two songs to the project, &quot;Arabesque&quot; and &quot;Tobenai Tsubasa.&quot;\n\nIn April 2000, Lily Chou-Chou music began to be released, with the single &quot;Glide&quot; and later &quot;KyÃ…ï¿½mei (KÃ…Â«kyo na Ishi)&quot; in June. Three Iwai-directed music videos were produced for the project, &quot;Glide,&quot; &quot;KyÃ…ï¿½mei (KÃ…Â«kyo na Ishi)&quot;[citation needed] and &quot;Tobenai Tsubasa.&quot; Salyu performed &quot;KyÃ…ï¿½mei (KÃ…Â«kyo na Ishi)&quot; on music shows Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ and Music Station in June 2000. The group released their album, KokyÃ…Â«, in October 2001, a week and a half after the release of the film in Japan.\n\nAfter the release of the film, the group ceased to release music. In 2003, the Lily Chou-Chou song &quot;Kaifuku Suru Kizu&quot; was featured in the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill Vol. 1. Salyu debuted as a musician in 2004 with the single &quot;Valon,&quot; a collaboration with hip-hop musician Ilmari. She began working with Kobayashi as her producer since her debut, and continues to work with him.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nThis is not my rip, but it was CDDA verified with audiochecker (screenshot and log are included) and the original ripper's log and scans of the CD are included. \n\n==================================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened.
