Using Jungian psychological type theory and the MBTIÂ© personality inventory, Quenk helps readers turn their moments of stress into gems of personal understanding and growth. Work-related stress and the effects of stress over time are both explored in Was That Really Me?, as is a simple explanation of type dynamics, type differentiation, and type development.
