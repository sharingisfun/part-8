The album is notable as the first commercially released pop album to employ binaural recording technology. Street Hassle combines live concert tapings (with overdubs) and studio recordings.\n\nAll of the songs on Street Hassle were written by Reed, including &quot;Real Good Time Together&quot;, a track that dates back to his days as a member of The Velvet Underground.\n\nThe album was met with mostly positive reviews, with AllMusic's Mark Deming writing, &quot;Raw, wounded, and unapologetically difficult, Street Hassle isn't the masterpiece Reed was shooting for, but it's still among the most powerful and compelling albums he released during the 1970s, and too personal and affecting to ignore.&quot;             Track listing\n\nAll songs written by Lou Reed.\n\nSide One:\n\n    &quot;Gimmie Some Good Times&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:15\n    &quot;Dirt&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:43\n    &quot;Street Hassle&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:53\n\n        A. &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; - 3:20\n        B. &quot;Street Hassle&quot; - 3:31\n        C. &quot;Slipaway&quot; - 4:02\n\nSide Two:\n\n    &quot;I Wanna Be Black&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n    &quot;Real Good Time Together&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:21\n    &quot;Shooting Star&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:11\n    &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n    &quot;Wait&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n                                                                                   Personnel\n\n    Lou Reed - guitar, bass, piano, vocals\n    Stuart Heinrich - guitar on &quot;Street Hassle&quot;, background vocal on &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;\n    Michael Fonfara - piano on &quot;I Wanna Be Black&quot; and &quot;Shooting Star&quot;\n    Marty Fogel - amplified saxophone\n    Steve Friedman - lead bass and background vocals on &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;\n    Jeffrey Ross - lead guitar, vocals on live recorded tracks\n    Michael Suchorsky - drums\n    Aram Schefrin - string arrangement\n    Jo'Anna Kameron, Angela Howard, Christine Wiltshire &amp; Genya Raven - background vocals\n    Bruce Springsteen - spoken word on &quot;Street Hassle: Slipaway&quot; (uncredited in liner notes)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cd77a38ddbe91616a08bae0600d61e5f7757889","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed+-+Street+Hassle+%281978%29+mp3+peaSoup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cd77a38ddbe91616a08bae0600d61e5f7757889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,215,122,56,221,190,145,97,106,8,186,224,96,13,97,229,247,117,120,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
