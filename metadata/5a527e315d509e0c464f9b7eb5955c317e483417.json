During the early '70s, the band had 12 straight Top Ten hits, including &quot;You Are Everything,&quot; &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow,&quot; &quot;I'm Stone in Love With You,&quot; &quot;Break Up to Make Up,&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New.&quot; Of all their peers, the Stylistics were one of the smoothest and sweetest soul groups of their era. All of their hits were ballads, graced by the soaring falsetto of Russell Thompkins, Jr. and the lush yet graceful productions of Bell, which helped make the Stylistics one of the most successful soul groups of the first half of the '70s.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-p5549/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-p5549/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Cub Koda):\n\nMany Stylistics collections are good, but this one features their biggest and best hits, including &quot;I'm Stone in Love with You,&quot; &quot;Rockin' Roll Baby,&quot; &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow,&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-stylistics-amherst-r19257&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-stylistics-amherst-r19257&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001O82&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001O82&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
