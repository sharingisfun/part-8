It works by applying new visual styles, also called skins, across the entire user interface (i.e. start menu, window frames, title bars, menus, buttons, taskbar, scroll bars, ...) of the operating system. As a result, you gain complete control over the way Windows looks.\n\nWindowBlinds comes with a number of visual styles to get you started. From there you can modify them by changing the colour, adding a texture, wallpaper, changing fonts, adjusting transparency, or blur. Create, edit and apply textures. Use UIS0 to apply textures to the Windows Aero visual style. Live previews of skins and transparencies. In addition, you can download thousands of free visual styles from the popular WinCustomize.com. With the addition of the separate SkinStudio, you can create your own skins for use with WindowBlinds.\n\n\n ~ Seed 4 others,Others would seed 4 u ~\n         Be a Gentleman!!\n\n    ______            ______   _______    \n   (  __  \\ |\\     /|(  __  \\ (  ____ \\   \n   | (  \\  )| )   ( || (  \\  )| (    \\/   \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (__       \n   | |   | || |   | || |   | ||  __)      \n   | |   ) || |   | || |   ) || (         \n _ | (__/  )| (___) || (__/  )| (____/\\ _ \n(_)(______/ (_______)(______/ (_______/(_)\n\n\nA simple THANKS goes a long way... :-)\nAny comments would b appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:413ee3167d4338d169e811047c62903a201f204f","amp;dn":"WindowBlinds+120+Themes+Mega+Collection+By+Ex%C3%82%C2%B5s+%5B.Dude.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"413ee3167d4338d169e811047c62903a201f204f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,62,227,22,125,67,56,209,105,232,17,4,124,98,144,58,32,31,32,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
