Barr, which led into the ongoing series under Mike Grell's direction. Though the Crisis on Infinite Earths reboot was only two years away, this served as a modern introduction to the character and is the template for all his post-reboot appearances since. \n\nPlot summary from ComicVine - &quot;The Battling Bowman fought his way into his own four issue mini series at long last, thanks to Mike W Barr and Trevor Von Eeden.\n\nWhen his old friend Abigail Horton passes away, Oliver Queen is forced to relive an infatuation from many years earlier with her daughter, Cynthia. Inheriting $34 million from Abigail, Ollie becomes a wanted man and the target of several assassination attempts. After facing his old foe Count Vertigo, Green Arrow finally discovers the person behind the attacks and Abigail's death.&quot;\n\nThese are the high-res digital copies by Son of Ultron-Empire. I have previously torrented the low-res rips as well so this supersedes those copies. Thanks to SoU_E for their work; please seed, and enjoy! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:561adc17ac1fe52515688686205e43aaaad3af0e","amp;dn":"Green+Arrow+v1+01-04+%281983%7CDigital%7CSon+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"561adc17ac1fe52515688686205e43aaaad3af0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,26,220,23,172,31,229,37,21,104,134,134,32,94,67,170,170,211,175,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
