A World Out of Time marks a departure. These eight tunes were recorded holistically as an album, then edited to become a flowing collage. ET haven't left their late psychedelic and experimental tropes behind, but they've honed them sharply. Opener &quot;When I Was in Your Mind,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by far the longest track here at nearly 13 minutes, employs one e-bow to Frippertronics-like effect and then mirrors it with another, played in more conventionally rockist terms. It gradually unfolds epically. While the guitar interplay between Nick Bindeman and Dewey Mahood is normally the centerpiece of the band's sound, on this cut Jed Bindeman's singularly inventive jazz drums are mixed up top. His swinging sense of groove presents a wonderful contrast to the chunky chords, drifting, droning leads, and Ryan Carlile's pulsing organ. Krag Likins' rocksteady bassline walks a bridge between all parties. In A World Out of Time, ET have given listeners a near perfect balance of precision and exploration that walks the tightrope between organic live playing and focused studio attention. This is the sound of a band coming fully into its own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:397be75e22d73fd0668989028d4fc53e200be69c","amp;dn":"Eternal+Tapestry+-+A+World+Out+of+Time+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"397be75e22d73fd0668989028d4fc53e200be69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,123,231,94,34,215,63,208,102,137,137,2,141,79,197,62,32,11,230,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
