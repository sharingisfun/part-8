In the first round, a faux meat and a hot mustard must be successfully combined. Then in a competition between chefs who questioned the judges' decision to send them home the first time, sour grapes is an appropriate ingredient in the second basket. And due to an extraordinary chain of events, neither finalist will ever forget the desserts that they prepared from bubble tea and papaya Ã¢â‚¬â€ or the judges' reactions to them.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 05-Nov-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bc60e8b735cd60683d80fa2a7e00a18eaece5ac","amp;dn":"Chopped.S17E11.Redeemed.or.Re-Chopped.HDTV.x264-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bc60e8b735cd60683d80fa2a7e00a18eaece5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,198,14,139,115,92,214,6,131,216,15,162,167,224,10,24,234,236,229,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
