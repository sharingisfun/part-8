But beside these scenes of glorious misrule gathers a nationwide rebellion led by the Duke of Northumberland and his charismatic son, Hotspur. The first installment of Shakespeare's gripping account of the rise of Hal from idle barfly to monarch-in-waiting.\n\nMy notes:\n\n   This may be the most popular of the releases from the Globe Theatre and it's company.  Roger Allam, Olivier Award winner,  takes stage in the way a Falstaff should be played.  And there are many comic interludes between the exposition of the history narrative.  It is the nature of the company at the Globe that, with viewings of many plays, you see returning actors from the ensemble.  I've found favorites and I hope you do as well.\n\n   \nNotes written August 9th,  2013\n\n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea86aa0a1453bb4a6fd8b59b3f8c5b7f19ac541","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Henry+IV+Part+One+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea86aa0a1453bb4a6fd8b59b3f8c5b7f19ac541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,168,106,160,161,69,59,180,166,253,139,89,179,248,197,183,241,154,197,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
