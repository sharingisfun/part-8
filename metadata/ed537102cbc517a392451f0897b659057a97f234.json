David Janssen stars as Richard Kimble, a physician who is falsely convicted of his wife's murder and given the death penalty. En route to death row, Kimble's train derails and crashes, allowing him to escape and begin a cross-country search for the real killer, a &quot;one-armed man&quot; (played by Bill Raisch). At the same time, Dr. Kimble is hounded by the authorities, most notably dogged by Police Lieutenant Philip Gerard (Barry Morse).\n\nThe Fugitive aired for four seasons, and a total of 120 51-minute episodes were produced. The first three seasons were filmed in black and white; the final season was in color.\n\nIn 2002, The Fugitive was ranked No. 36 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. TV Guide named the one-armed man #5 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed537102cbc517a392451f0897b659057a97f234","amp;dn":"The+Fugitive+TV+Series+-+4+Seasons+%281963-1967%29+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed537102cbc517a392451f0897b659057a97f234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,83,113,2,203,197,23,163,146,69,31,8,151,182,89,5,122,151,242,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
