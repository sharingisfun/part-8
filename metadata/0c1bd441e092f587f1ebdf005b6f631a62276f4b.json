Banned in the US for 30 years.\n\nThe only American film banned from release for reasons other than obscenity or national security, Titicut Follies was filmed inside the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Bridgewater, a prison hospital for the criminally insane. After the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sued the filmmakers, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the film constituted was an invasion of inmate privacy and ordered the withdrawal of the film from circulation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c1bd441e092f587f1ebdf005b6f631a62276f4b","amp;dn":"Titicut+Follies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c1bd441e092f587f1ebdf005b6f631a62276f4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,27,212,65,224,146,245,135,241,235,223,0,91,111,99,26,98,39,111,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
