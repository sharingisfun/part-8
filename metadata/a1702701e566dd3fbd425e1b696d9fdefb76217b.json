If their newly-released Ep &quot;Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel&quot; is any indication, they're taking no prisoners this time, and I expect nothing less from this terrifying trio. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We took all the time in the world to complete this project,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says frontman Nergal, describing it as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an ecstatic manifest of our unrestrained artistic will, where we dare to reach out beyond the limitations of the heavy metal genre... and it's only the beginning.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I agree completely This Ep demonstrates the band hasn't lost their edge in the years after Evangelion, and for my money the title track is among their best work to date. From the mesmerizing central riff with evil harmonics.\nimage\nXiadz' is a thoroughly enjoyable EP which continues where 'The Satanist' left off. It also probably indicates a new direction that the band is taking to create denser song structures, sacrificing some part of the sheer frantic pace and brutality for greater doses of melancholy and emotion. Although I did miss the bursts of speed and brutality and it became even more apparent after successive listens of the EP, I also got lost in the intensity and the pensive mood the band creates on the EP.\n\n[img]http://i861.photobucket.com/albums/ab179/necroguttural/20bdcfdd4280c82dfbdddeb4814d80df_zps5ab8c002.jpg~original[/img]\n\n\n1.
