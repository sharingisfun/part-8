Her father is a policeman who cannot hide his joy when activist Steve Biko is caught by the South African authorities. Piper Dellums is the daughter of a US congressman from California and who lives in a nice home in Washington DC. When Mahree is chosen to spend a semester at the Dellums' house, she doesn't expect that her host family would be black. Nor do her hosts suspect that she is not a black South African.\n\nThe audio becomes a bit unsynched at the end. All other torrents of this movie that I found are defunked. I downloaded the parts from youtube and combined them. I hope you enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce4a363e8e94e41af56a08a7ed65198293e42ea","amp;dn":"The+Color+of+Friendship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce4a363e8e94e41af56a08a7ed65198293e42ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,228,163,99,232,233,78,65,175,86,160,138,126,214,81,152,41,62,66,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
