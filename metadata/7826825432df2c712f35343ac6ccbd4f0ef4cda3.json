June 21, 1954, Los Angeles, keyboards, vocals), Steve Lukather (b. October 21, 1957, Los Angeles, guitar, vocals), Bobby Kimball (b. Robert Toteaux, March 29, 1947, Vinton, LA, vocals), Steve Porcaro (b. September 2, 1957, Connecticut, keyboards), David Hungate (b. Texas, bass), and Jeff Porcaro (b. April 1, 1954, Hartford, CT, d. August 5, 1992, Hidden Hills, CA. drums). \n\nToto released its self-titled debut album in October 1978, and it hit the Top Ten, sold two-million copies, and spawned the gold Top Ten single Hold the Line. The gold-selling Hydra (October 1979) and Turn Back (January 1981) were less successful, but Toto IV (April 1982) was a multi-platinum Top Ten hit, featuring the number-one hit Africa and the Top Tens Rosanna (about Lukather's girlfriend, movie star Rosanna Arquette) and I Won't Hold You Back. At the 1982 Grammys, Rosanna won awards for Record of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Instrumental Arrangement With Vocal; and Toto IV won awards for Album of the Year, Best Engineered Recording, and Best Producer (the group). In 1984, a third Porcaro brother, Mike (b. May 29, 1955), joined the group on bass, replacing Hungate. Then lead singer Kimball quit and was replaced by Dennis Fergie Frederiksen (b. May 15, 1951, Wyoming, MI).\n\nToto's fifth album, Isolation (November 1984), went gold, but was a commercial disappointment. Frederiksen was replaced by Joseph Williams (b. Santa Monica), the son of the conductor/composer John Williams, for Fahrenheit (August 1986). Steve Porcaro quit in 1988, prior to the release of The Seventh One.
