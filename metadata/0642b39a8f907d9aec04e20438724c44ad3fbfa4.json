It has such potential to be huge and it's so hard to get. I found it on a site from England. That said... this music is just not good, it's serious good. At times she reminds me of a female Nine Inch Nails. I love her older stuff but this music has weight to it and is so well procuced. It's like a rediscovery. Super recomended.&quot; \n\n&quot;What can be said about this force of nature ? I just finished listening to this from start to finish and it is brilliant. As the previous reviewer aptly stated - she has picked up flawlessly - who would know she was gone? With all her old buddies Sly, Robbie and Barry and Brian Eno (!) on board - oh even Jean Paul Goode - how could this not be so resoundlingly recorded - timeless, graceful, punctuated with an exclamation and smirk - love you grace. THANK YOU! (Why is this showing up as discontinued already? - Corporate Cannibal maybe?)&quot;     \n\n&quot;This year has seen the releases of some of my favorite all time divas, old and new. Taylor Dayne, Eva Cassidy, Jennifer Hudson, Linda Eder, Thelma Houston, Janet, Madonnna and Donna &quot;The Empress&quot; Summer. All of them genuine entertainment. Then Hurricane by Grace Jones stopped me dead in my tracks. If you are a true lover of perfection, you only have to experience the perfection known as Grace Jones to be taken to that special place that she has created in this work that will touch that inner most place simply called PLEASURE.&quot;  \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
