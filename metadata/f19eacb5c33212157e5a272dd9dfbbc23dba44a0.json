Set between 1912 and 1933, it stars Oskar Werner as the German Jules and Henri Serre as the Frenchman Jim, kindred spirits who, while on holiday in Greece, fall in love with the smile on the face of a sculpture. Back in Paris, the smile comes to life in the person of Catherine (Jeanne Moreau); the three individuals become constant companions, determined to live their lives to the fullest despite the world war around them. When Jules declares his love for Catherine, Jim agrees to let Jules pursue her, despite his own similar feelings; Jules and Catherine marry and have a child (Sabine Haudepin), but Catherine still loves Jim as well. An influential film that has grown in stature over the decades, Jules et Jim was often viewed by the counterculture of the 1960s as a cinematic proponent of the free-love movement, but in actuality the picture is a statement against such a way of life. Despite the bond shared by Jules, Jim, and Catherine, their mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nage ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  trois is doomed to fail; and Catherine's inability to choose between the two men leads to tragic consequences for all three. \n\n\nIMDB .............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055032/\nYear.............: 1962\nCountry..........: France\nRuntime..........: 106 Minutes\nAudio............: French  (Dolby Digital 2.0)\nSubtitles........: English, Spanish (custom), French (custom), German (custom), Portuguese (custom)\nVideo Format.....: NTSC\nAspect Ratio.....: 2.42:1\nDVD Source.......: DVD9 (DVD Release Date: May 31st, 2005)\nDVD Distributor..: Criterion\nProgram..........: DVD Decrypter, DVD Remake, Muxman, Subtitle Workshop, PGC Demux...\nDVD Review.......: dvdbeaver\nSize..........: 7.44 GB\nBitrate..........: 7.7 mb/s \n\nPosted originally at Cinematik by elhippie.
