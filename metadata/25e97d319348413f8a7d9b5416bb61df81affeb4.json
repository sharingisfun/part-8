This new capability gave birth to the traditional British roast.\r\n\r\nRuth follows in the footsteps of Britain's herring girls, revealing how the North Yorkshire Moors Railway revived the fortunes of Whitby, turning it into a thriving fishing town, supplying the country's kippers.\r\n\r\nAlex looks at how pioneering farmers attempted to use steam power to increase production, getting to grips with the latest steam-ploughing technology.\r\n\r\nPeter discovers how steam-powered engines revolutionised production at Britain's oldest brewery and how the traction engine worked alongside the locomotive to distribute beer across the country.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire, Ruth sees how farmers created a monopoly on rhubarb, growing the crop in dark sheds and transporting it nightly to London on the rhubarb express.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alex boards a locomotive on the watercress line in Hampshire, discovering how the railway brought the nutritional salad to the masses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e97d319348413f8a7d9b5416bb61df81affeb4","amp;dn":"Full.Steam.Ahead.%5B2016%5D.s01e03.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e97d319348413f8a7d9b5416bb61df81affeb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,233,125,49,147,72,65,63,138,125,155,84,22,187,97,223,129,175,254,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
