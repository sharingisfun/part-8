Subramanian (Wiley-VCH, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nThoroughly revised, with either entirely new or completely updated contents, this is a practical manual for the small and large-scale preparation of enantiomerically pure products. The result is a vital resource for meeting the highest purity standards in the manufacture of chiral pharmaceuticals, food additives and related compounds. All the approaches covered here are highly relevant to modern manufacturing and quality control schemes in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, addressing the increasingly important issue of drug safety in view of tougher regulatory standards worldwide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:560dc8fa8c53c5e51afbb8a9012f0cedfc20681d","amp;dn":"Chiral+Separation+Techniques+-+A+Practical+Approach+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"560dc8fa8c53c5e51afbb8a9012f0cedfc20681d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,13,200,250,140,83,197,229,26,251,184,169,1,47,12,237,252,32,104,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
