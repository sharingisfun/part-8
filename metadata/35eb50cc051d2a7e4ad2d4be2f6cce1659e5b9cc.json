And, looking back, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to see why they sold millions; not everyone in the world was pissed off, dissatisfied with the economy, or even necessarily looking for a change. In fact, for most suburban American teens, ForeignerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immaculate rock sound was the perfect soundtrack for cruising through well-manicured neighborhoods in their Chevy Novas. The album spawned some of the biggest FM hits of 1977, including the anthemic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Feels Like the First TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold as Ice,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both of which were anchored Ã¢â‚¬â€ like most of ForeignerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs Ã¢â‚¬â€ by the muscular but traditional riffing of guitarist Mick Jones, the soaring vocals of Lou Gramm, and the state-of-the-art rock production values of the day, which allowed the band to sound hard but polished. As pure rock craftsmanship goes, Foreigner was as good as it got in the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s.\nfrom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35eb50cc051d2a7e4ad2d4be2f6cce1659e5b9cc","amp;dn":"Foreigner+-+Foreigner+%282010+MFSL+Remaster%29+HD+24%2F96+flac+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35eb50cc051d2a7e4ad2d4be2f6cce1659e5b9cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,235,80,204,5,29,42,126,74,210,212,190,47,108,206,22,89,229,185,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
