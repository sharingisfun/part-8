Including perennials like &quot;That'll Be the Day,&quot; &quot;Oh Boy,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue,&quot; the album also features fine covers of &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; and &quot;Bo Diddley,&quot; not to mention lushly orchestrated stunners such as &quot;Raining in My Heart,&quot; &quot;True Love Ways,&quot; and the Paul Anka-penned &quot;It Doesn't Matter Anymore.&quot; Along the way, one hears hefty premonitions of the Beatles' pre-1965 sound, one of the first self-contained rock bands in fine form, and some of most lyrical and substantial songs from the music's golden beginnings. Holly's sound was more country than R&amp;B, and as such also prefigured the folk-pop of both the British Invasion and the West Coast sound of the '60s. A perfect introduction for those trolling the discount bins. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/1/4/a/4/4a4e9fd0-e5b2-012b-ff83-0050569428b1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/1/4/a/4/4a4e9fd0-e5b2-012b-ff83-0050569428b1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1. &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot;\n2. &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;\n3. &quot;Words of Love&quot;\n4. &quot;Everyday&quot;\n5. &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;\n6. &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot;\n7. &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;\n8. &quot;Listen to Me&quot;\n9. &quot;Heartbeat&quot;\n10. &quot;Think It Over&quot;\n\nSide two\n\n1. &quot;It Doesn't Matter Anymore&quot;\n2. &quot;It's So Easy&quot;\n3. &quot;Well...
