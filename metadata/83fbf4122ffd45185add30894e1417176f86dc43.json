Master the weapons of war, using momentum and timing to fight for your life in a world built on the bones of a ruined empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur unconventional twin stick control scheme lets you wreak havoc on your opponents. Analogue sticks and triggers directly translate into character and weapon control, enabling you to time your swings, throws and stabs. Swordyâ€™s weapons and damage model are completely physics based, youâ€™ll need to master the momentum and weight of your character and weapon together to fight effectively. Itâ€™s easy to pick up but leaves a lot of space for mastery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Swordy you will wield and engage with a variety of weapon types and fighting tactics. Slashing, stabbing, piercing crushing, cleaving, throwing, and dual wielding are available in the form of swords, knives, hammers, flails, axes, shields and more as we develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are working on a variety of competitive, cooperative and party game modes. You will be able to refine your skills against AI players, compete against your friends or fight together through the challenges of a harsh and mysterious land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world of Swordy is set in the ruins of an ancient age.
