The film was mostly filmed in Malaysia, and is based on a true story.\n\nBowman joins, albeit initially unintentionally, political rallies with university students protesting for democracy, and travels with the student leader U Aung Ko throughout Burma. There, they see the brutality of the military dictators of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), and attempt to escape to Thailand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c6a0b2ab7775cee21d951953a732651519b5af","amp;dn":"Beyond+Rangoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c6a0b2ab7775cee21d951953a732651519b5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,198,160,178,171,119,117,206,226,29,149,25,83,167,50,101,21,25,181,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
