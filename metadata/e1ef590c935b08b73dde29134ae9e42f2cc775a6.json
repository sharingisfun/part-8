Rooted in principles of self-expression, self-reliance and community effort, Burning Man has grown famous for stirring ordinary people to shed their nine-to-five existence and act on their dreams. Spark takes us behind the curtain with Burning Man organizers and participants, revealing a year of unprecedented challenges and growth. When ideals of a new world based on freedom and inclusion collide with realities of the &quot;default world,&quot; we wonder which dreams can survive.\n\nWEBRip\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ef590c935b08b73dde29134ae9e42f2cc775a6","amp;dn":"Spark_+A+Burning+Man+Story+%281080p+HD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ef590c935b08b73dde29134ae9e42f2cc775a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,239,89,12,147,91,8,183,61,222,41,19,74,233,228,47,44,199,117,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
