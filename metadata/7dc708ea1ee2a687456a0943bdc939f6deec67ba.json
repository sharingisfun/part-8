More old games that are not on any torrents and pretty hard to locate. Some are dead for a reason (they suck!) but some are pretty good. I make no apologies for the quality of some of these, I am just filling the gaps. If you don't like it, well, it was free, and you know where the delete button is! :-) \n\nThis was requested by Airwalker007 - It's on TPB, but is dead and 4.3GB!\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Agatha Christie - And Then There Were None [RQTP6V] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Graphic Adventure - good too!\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (I have my uTorrent set to 1000%/10.0 !!) \nDo not just leech and run - help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help, please try to seed for as long as you can.\n\nIf you like it, maybe buy a Wii game that is not in my list, or here on TPB and upload it for the rest of us to have too - Thanks! :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 800+ Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search it and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all Wii games out there...\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc708ea1ee2a687456a0943bdc939f6deec67ba","amp;dn":"Wii+Agatha+Christie+-+And+Then+There+Were+None+%5BRQTP6V%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc708ea1ee2a687456a0943bdc939f6deec67ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,199,8,234,30,226,166,135,69,106,9,67,189,201,57,246,222,236,103,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
