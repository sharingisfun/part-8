But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that his greatest battle is about to begin. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp. Directed by Marc Webb. Produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. Screenplay by Alex Kurtzman &amp; Roberto Orci &amp; Jeff Pinkner. Screen Story by Alex Kurtzman &amp; Roberto Orci &amp; Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt. Based on the Marvel comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605bbb76f1bd33d0cd06275c45db90f8d9c944bc","amp;dn":"The+Amazing+Spider-Man+2+%282014%29+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605bbb76f1bd33d0cd06275c45db90f8d9c944bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,91,187,118,241,189,51,208,205,6,39,92,69,219,144,248,217,201,68,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
