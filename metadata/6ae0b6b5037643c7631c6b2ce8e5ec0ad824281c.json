All of geometric optics can be derived from Fermat's principle which is an extremum principle. The counterpart in classical mechanics is of course Hamilton's principle. There is a very close analogy between mechanics of particles and optics of light rays.\nOnly 197 pages (without appendices).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae0b6b5037643c7631c6b2ce8e5ec0ad824281c","amp;dn":"Lagrangian+Optics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae0b6b5037643c7631c6b2ce8e5ec0ad824281c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,224,182,181,3,118,67,199,99,28,107,44,232,229,236,10,216,36,40,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
