LinguÃƒÂ¨re, a former resident and local beauty, now very rich, returns to this, the village of her birth. The elders hope that she will be a benefactor to the village. To encourage her generosity, they appoint a local grocer, Dramaan, as mayor--who once courted her and will now try to persuade her to help. In fact, LinguÃƒÂ¨re has returned with the intention of sharing her millions with the village but only in return for an unexpected action. This plot twist brings human folly and cynicism into sharp focus.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c868d302aa770e460c9cc0eb0d7957369c2991","amp;dn":"Hyenas+%28Hy%26egrave%3Bnes%29+%5B1992%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c868d302aa770e460c9cc0eb0d7957369c2991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,200,104,211,2,170,119,14,70,12,156,192,235,13,121,87,54,156,41,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
