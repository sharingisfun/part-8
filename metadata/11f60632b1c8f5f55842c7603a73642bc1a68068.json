They are one of the oldest and most important bands of the Brazilian thrash metal scene, along with bands like SarcÃƒÂ³fago and Sepultura. Their first release was issued in the seminal metal compilation called SP Metal on Baratos Afins label back in 1985.\nThey changed the lineup a lot of times since the birth of the band, but three members, Marcello Pompeu (on vocals), Silvio Golfetti (on guitars) and Dick (on bass guitar) remained. The classic lineup of the band (1988Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1992) was Marcello Pompeu (vocals), Silvio Golfetti (guitars), Marcelo Nicastro (guitars), Dick (bass) and Roberto BetÃƒÂ£o Sileci (drums, replacing Zema who committed suicide in 1988).\n\nThe odd thing about their career is that their debut album was a live album (instead of a studio release) from 1986 but soon in 1987 they released their first studio album called Sonho ManÃƒÂ­aco with a distinctively rough metal sound, very much like Dark Angel's Darkness Descends and Slayer's Reign In Blood.\nAround that time, Silvio Golfetti played guitars for the L.A. speed metal band Agent Steel for a short time in 1987, because he was a friend of John Cyriis, vocalist of Agent Steel and born in Brazil. He temporarily played guitars for Sepultura at the time when Andreas Kisser was unable to play due to an arm injury.\nIn 1989, they changed their sound a little, going more in a direction of Bay Area thrash, and released the EP Pay For Your Lies, which become a classic in South American metal, featuring a cover of Black Sabbath's &quot;Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes&quot;. During that period Korzus became a major metal band in the Brazilian scene; they even struck a friendship with their idol, the late legendary Formula One racer Ayrton Senna.\nTwo years later they came up with what most people call the best Korzus album to date, Mass Illusion. With the expert production of Roger Moreira (vocalist/founder of one of the most known rock bands in Brazil called Ultraje A Rigor) the band gained more attention outside Brazil. A videoclip for the song &quot;Agony&quot; was made, and it received heavy air play on Furia Metal (a Brazilian version of MTV's Headbangers Ball).\nThings were going well but the drummer Beto Silesci and the guitarist Marcelo Nicastro left the band, as each one pursued their own projects (Beto Silesci formed a band with his wife and tried the drums in the hardcore band Ratos de PorÃƒÂ£o; Nicastro became a well-known player of cavaquinho - a short four-string guitar used to play samba, the most popular style of music in Brazil).\n\nAfter the departure of Beto Sileci and Marcelo Nicastro, the band started to try an audience out of Brazil, due to the success of Sepultura.\nThey recruited a guitarist called Soldado and a drummer called Fernando Schaefer and recorded in 1994 the album KZS. The band was musically fitting with the 90's NYHC sound of bands such as Madball and Sick Of It All. On tour they played in the States with Biohazard and S.O.D.[disambiguation needed].\nAfter two years, Soldado and Fernando Schaefer left the band (Fernando Schaefer became a drummer for several Brazilian bands like Treta, PavilhÃƒÂ£o9, Rodox, Kiko Loureiro, and recently Endrah), and to replace them, they hired Heros Trench for the guitar post and Rodrigo Oliveira as the drummer.\nThis lineup is still playing together and since they recorded in 1998 a live CD at the Brazilian edition of the Monsters of Rock festival and after some years without recording any album, they released the album Ties Of Blood in 2004.\nKorzus has a new formation, which includes AntÃƒÂ´nio AraÃƒÂºjo as the new guitar player (replacing Silvio Golfetti). Critics state that AntÃƒÂ´nio is one of the best Brazilian musicians of the last few years. His abilities are compared to Andreas Kisser, but with less experience.\n\nFinally KORZUS are back: Since their latest album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Discipline of HateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the fans had to wait a very long time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and now they will release their very new 2014 studio album Ã¢â‚¬Å“LegionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½! KORZUS are one of the most legendary bands of the Brazilian thrash metal scene, along with Sepultura and Sarcofago. They prove that you can stay true to your roots without denying that time moves on. Ã¢â‚¬Å“LegionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a timeless thrash metal attack that will amaze every fan of Slayer, Onslaught, Kreator and more, but itÃ‚Â´s not just a copy other successful bands, KORZUS do create something unique on their own.\nAnd though KORZUS have been founded in 1983 already, itÃ‚Â´s obvious that this band is Ã¢â‚¬Å“set on fireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ burning to bring their monstrous songs to the stages. This is where they are best, proof is their amazing reputation for being one of the most intense live acts of South America.\n\n\nLine-up:\nMarcello Pompeu (vocal)\nHeros Trench (guitar, backing vocals)\nAntÃƒÂ´nio AraÃƒÂºjo (guitar, backing vocals)\nDick Siebert (bass guitar)\nRodrigo Oliveira(drums)\n\n\nDiscography:\nKorzus Live (1985)\nSonho ManÃƒÂ­aco (1987)\nPay For Your Lies (1989)\nMass Illusion (1991)\nKZS (1994)\nLive At Monsters Of Rock (1998)\nTies Of Blood (2004)\nDiscipline of Hate (2010)\nThey been around for awhile but they do make you wait in between releases\n\n\nPlaylist:\n01.
