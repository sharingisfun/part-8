A disc where you never skip a track because you don't like a particular song. But even above this CD's delightful music is its value as an audio tuning tool.\n\nFor over a decade, every piece of audio equipment I have bought has had to undergo (and pass, if I intend to keep it) the Obsession test. That title song is simply amazing! It is the most perfectly recorded and engineered song I have ever heard. Frequency response, channel separation, signal level- I have literally listened to this one song over a thousand times (an obsession??), and to this day it still amazes me. You can find flaws in practically any stereo equipment with Obsession. \n\nEvery speaker, every amplifier or receiver, every set of headphones, every equalizer, every CD player that I have owned since first getting this CD has been broken in with this song. And yes, it really is good enough to pinpoint sonic differences between two CD players.\n\nOh yeah, the music... The pace is rapid throughout, opening with the frenzied (and VERY appropriately named) title song, and only slowing down for the very pensive &quot;Rain&quot;. &quot;Gone Hollywood&quot; makes a profound statement, even 15+ years after this disc's release. And Mr. James' attack on the piano in &quot;3 A.M.&quot; is absolutely unforgettable. Again, the tonal quality of this entire CD is superlative, and no two songs sound even remotely alike.\n\n&quot;Obsession&quot; is a timeless classic that has become my one and only test disc for every stereo I own (home, computer, and vehicle). You simply cannot go wrong in buying this CD. If the content doesn't hook you, the sonic purity will.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/v2i4JwqmnX.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Bob James - Obsession (Warner 25495)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bob James\nAlbum................: Obsession (Warner 25495)\nGenre................: Contemporary Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1986\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 56 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
