The album is divided into three sections, with each disc being a separate collection in its own. It borrows from Tom WaitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ typical rock sound, with the first disc being blues and rock-based, the second centred on slow-tempo, melancholic ballads, and the third on more experimental compositions. Additionally, the record contains influences of other genres, including folk, gospel, jazz and roots music. Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards received universal acclaim from critics, who lauded its experimentation and composition, as well as Waits' vocals. It was listed as one of the highest-scoring albums of the year in Metacritic, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Furthermore, it was a fair commercial success, charting in the United States Billboard 200, as well as in Australia, Switzerland and Austria, reaching the top twenty in the latter. The Orphans Tour was conducted in support of the album prior to its release..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Lie To Me\n[02] LowDown\n[03] 2:19\n[04] Fish In The Jailhouse\n[05] Bottom Of The World\n[06] Lucinda\n[07] Ain't Goin' Down To The Well\n[08] Lord I've Been Changed\n[09] Puttin' On The Dog\n[10] Road To Peace\n[11] All The Time\n[12] The Return Of Jackie And Judy\n[13] Walk Away\n[14] Sea Of Love\n[15] Buzz Fledderjohn\n[16] Rains On Me\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:04m:14s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Bend Down The Branches\n[02] You Can Never Hold Back Spring\n[03] Long Way Home\n[04] Widow's Grove\n[05] Little Drop Of Poison\n[06] Shiny Things\n[07] World Keeps Turning\n[08] Tell It To Me\n[09] Never Let Go\n[10] Fannin Street\n[11] Little Man\n[12] It's Over\n[13] If I Have To Go\n[14] Goodnight Irene\n[15] The Fall Of Troy\n[16] Take Care Of All My Children\n[17] Down There By The Train\n[18] Danny Says\n[19] Jayne's Blue Wish\n[20] Young At Heart\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:09m:28s\n\nCD-03 - Track Listings\n\n[01] What Keeps Mankind Alive\n[02] Children's Story\n[03] Heigh Ho\n[04] Army Ants\n[05] Books Of Moses\n[06] Bone Chain\n[07] Two Sisters\n[08] First Kiss\n[09] Dog Door\n[10] Redrum\n[11] Nirvana\n[12] Home I'll Never Be\n[13] Poor Little Lamb\n[14] Altar Boy\n[15] The Pontiac\n[16] Spidey's Wild Ride\n[17] King Kong\n[18] On The Road\n[19] Dog Treat\n[20] Missing My Son\n\nCD-03 Play Time - 00h:55m:37s\n\n\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 03h:09m:19s\nTotal File Size....................... 1.02GBs (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
