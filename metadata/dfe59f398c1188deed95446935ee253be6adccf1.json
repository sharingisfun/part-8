You are the controller.\n\nIn addition to Needs, Sims now have Moodlets, which can be positive or negative. Moodlets involve events such as emotional or physical events, such as a good meal, comfort from sitting in a good chair, and other things. Most Moodlets last for a set duration, whereas some negative Moodlets can be cured and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings.\n\nThe previous system of Wants and Fears from Sims 2 has been replaced with a new Wishes system. Fulfilling a Wish contributes to the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score, which can be used to purchase Lifetime Happiness Rewards.\n\nSims live for a set duration of time (adjustable by the player) and advance through several stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder). Sims can die of old age or they can die prematurely from causes such as fire, starvation, drowning, electrocution or mummy curse (new with Sims 3 World Adventures)\n\n\nSystem requirements\n===================  \n \nWindows :\n \nOperating System Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1 or Windows 7 \nCPU Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent\n2.0GHz (XP)\n2.4GHz (Vista or 7) [If built-in graphics chipsets then 2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo, or equivalent.] \nMemory 1 GB RAM(XP)\n1.5GB RAM (Vista or 7) [If built-in graphics then add 0.5 GB additional RAM] \nHard Drive Space 6.1GB or more for extra content \nGraphics Hardware DirectX 9.0c compatible card with 128 MB RAM (NVIDIA FX 5900/ATI 9500 or better) and support for Pixel Shader 2.0 \nSound Hardware 100% DirectX 9.0c compatible card \n\nMacintosh :\n \nOperating System Mac OS X 10.5.7 Leopard \nCPU Intel Core Duo Processor \nMemory 2 GB RAM\nHard Drive Space 6.1GB of free space and 1GB for additional content \nGraphics Hardware ATI X1600 or NVIDIA 7300 GT with 128 MB RAM or Intel Integrated GMA X3100 \n\n\n\n   \n              ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe59f398c1188deed95446935ee253be6adccf1","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+THE+SIMS+3+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe59f398c1188deed95446935ee253be6adccf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,229,159,57,140,17,136,222,237,149,68,105,53,238,37,59,230,173,204,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
