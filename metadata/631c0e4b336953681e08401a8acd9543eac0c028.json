Set in the China of the 1930s, the film stars Ingrid Bergman as real-life missionary Gladys Aylward. Against the advice of practically everyone, Gladys heads into the war-ravaged interior to spread the Christian gospel. She finds a powerful ally in the form of an elderly Mandarin (Robert Donat) who, despite his early efforts to rid himself of the troublesome Gladys, eventually converts to Christianity. Gladys' burgeoning romance with Chinese army officer Lin Nan (Curt Jurgens) is interrupted when she is obliged to guide a group of Chinese children to safety over some of the most treacherous of Northern China's mountain regions. Inn of the Sixth Happiness retains its entertainment value some four decades after its production, even allowing for the preponderance of Occidental actors in Oriental roles. The film also served to breathe new life into the old children's nonsense song &quot;This Old Man&quot; (aka &quot;Knick, Knack, Paddywhack&quot;).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051776/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051776/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-51776/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-51776/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x360\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1213 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,18 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:631c0e4b336953681e08401a8acd9543eac0c028","amp;dn":"The+Inn+of+the+Sixth+Happiness+%281958%29+multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"631c0e4b336953681e08401a8acd9543eac0c028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,28,14,75,51,105,83,104,30,8,64,26,138,205,149,67,234,192,192,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
