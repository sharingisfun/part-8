This book reveals the most exhilarating oddities from Professor StewartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary cabinet.\n\nInside, you will find hidden gems of logic, geometry, and probabilityÃ‚â€”like how to extract a cherry from a cocktail glass (harder than you think), a pop-up dodecahedron, and the real reason why you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t divide anything by zero. Scattered among these are keys to FermatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last theorem, the PoincarÃƒÂ© conjecture, chaos theory, and the P=NP problem (youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll win a million dollars if you solve it). You never know what enigmas youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find in the Stewart cabinet, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re sure to be clever, mind-expanding, and delightfully fun.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/0465013023/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/0465013023/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98139cb6af419e9c2ab808c4dfdb09244cd3313","amp;dn":"Professor+Stewart%27s+Cabinet+of+Mathematical+Curiosities.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98139cb6af419e9c2ab808c4dfdb09244cd3313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,129,57,203,106,244,25,233,194,171,128,140,77,253,176,146,68,205,51,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
