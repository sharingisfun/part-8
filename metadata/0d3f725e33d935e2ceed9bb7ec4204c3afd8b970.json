When Katie's sugar habit went too far in college and left her lacking energy, she knew something needed to change. So she began developing her own naturally sweet recipes and posting them online. Soon, Katie's healthy dessert blog had become an Internet sensation, with over six million monthly visitors.\n\nNow, in her first cookbook, Katie shares over 80 never-before-seen recipes, such as Chocolate Obsession Cake, Peanut Butter Pudding Pops, and Ultimate Unbaked Brownies, that use only real ingredients, without any unnecessary fats, sugars, or empty calories. These desserts prove once and for all that health and happiness can go hand-in-hand-you can have your dessert and eat it, too!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3f725e33d935e2ceed9bb7ec4204c3afd8b970","amp;dn":"Chocolate+Covered+Katie+-+Katie+Higgins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3f725e33d935e2ceed9bb7ec4204c3afd8b970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,63,114,94,51,217,53,226,206,237,155,183,236,66,4,195,175,216,185,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
