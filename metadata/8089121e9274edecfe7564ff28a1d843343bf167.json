Having borne the burden of one death too many, Munroe has fled to Djibouti, Africa. There, where her only responsibility is greasing the wheels of commerce for a small maritime security company, she finds stillnessÃ¢â‚¬â€until her boss pressures her to join his team as an armed transit guard on a ship bound for Kenya. \n Days into the voyage, Munroe discovers the security contract is merely cover for a gunrunning operation of which she wants no part. The ship is invaded off the Somali coast and in a moment of impulse while fighting her way out, she drags the unconscious captain with her. But nothing about the hijacking is what it seems. \n The pirates were never after the ship; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d come for the captain. In chasing him, they make their one mistake: targeting Munroe raises the killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instinct sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried so hard to bury. Wounded and on the run, Vanessa Michael Munroe will use the life of her catch as bait and bartering chip to manipulate every player with a stake in the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outcome, and find a way to wash her conscience clean.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8089121e9274edecfe7564ff28a1d843343bf167","amp;dn":"The+Catch+by+Taylor+Stevens+%28Retail+-+New+Release%29+%7BRose88%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8089121e9274edecfe7564ff28a1d843343bf167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,137,18,30,146,116,237,236,254,117,100,255,40,161,216,67,52,59,241,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
