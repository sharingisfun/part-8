HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an artful dodger, so Martine, a former model with a thing for him, brings him her scheme: a bankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s alarm is off for a couple weeks, so letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tunnel into the vault. He assembles a team, not realizing her real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and MI-5, or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed. A Trinidadian thug, a high-end bordello owner, and a pornographer also have things stored in the vault, so the break-in threatens many a powerful personage. Is there any way these amateurs can pull it off?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/\nRelease Date: 7 March 2008 (USA)\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Thriller\nStars: Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows, Stephen Campbell Moore\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-ESiR\nSize: 750MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c33076ab55da331fbc732dfc74ef37e67e6f988","amp;dn":"The+Bank+Job+%282008%29+BluRay+720p+750MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c33076ab55da331fbc732dfc74ef37e67e6f988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,51,7,106,181,93,163,49,251,199,50,223,199,78,243,126,103,230,249,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
