It features many of her greatest hits, and includes all the singles from her debut Toni Braxton and all but one of the singles from her second album Secrets. Her albums The Heat and More Than a Woman are fairly underrepresented, as only two and one songs are included from each album, respectively. The songs on Ultimate are not the actual album versions but radio edits, and the version of &quot;Seven Whole Days&quot; is live.  The album also includes two new songs, &quot;Whatchu Need&quot; (produced by Rodney Jerkins) and &quot;The Little Things&quot; (produced by R. Kelly). Toni's first single &quot;Give U My Heart&quot; (a duet with Babyface) that was included on the &quot;Boomerang&quot; soundtrack, and a remix of &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;. There is also a Box Set edition of the album which contains six additional remixes. According to Billboard, the album has sold 400,000 copies as of May 2013. It was certified Gold in UK, in July 2013.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Give U My Heart - - - Toni Braxton &amp; Babyface\n[02] Love Shoulda Brought You Home\n[03] Another Sad Love Song\n[04] Breathe Again\n[05] Seven Whole Days (Live)\n[06] You Mean The World To Me\n[07] How Many Ways\n[08] You're Makin' Me High\n[09] Let It Flow\n[10] Un-Break My Heart\n[11] I Love Me Some Him\n[12] I Don't Want To\n[13] He Wasn't Man Enough\n[14] Just Be A Man About It\n[15] Hit The Freeway - - - Toni Braxton Featuring Loon\n[16] Watchu Need (Previously Unreleased)\n[17] The Little Things (Previously Unreleased)\n[18] Un-Break My Heart (Soul-Hex Anthem Radio Edit)\n\nPlay Time - 01h:15m:23s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Un-Break My Heart [Frankie Knuckles Franktidrama Club Mix]\n[02] You're Makin' Me High [Norfside Remix]\n[03] How Many Ways\n[04] I Don't Want To [Franktified Club Mix]\n[05] Hit The Freeway [Goldtrix Full Vocal Edit]\n[06] He Wasn't Man Enough [Forces Of Nature Remix]\n\nPlay Time - 00h:42m:53s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:58m:16s\nTotal File Size....................... 836mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
