It ALSO comes with a few extra mods - Deathmatch Classic \n\n(Basically, Quake) Ricochet (Quite fun with a few friends) and Team Fortress \n\nClassic.\n\nYou can choose not to install any extra mods.\n\nWhen installing, you will be prompted if you want to install the HD pack. This \n\nbasically replaces the textures, giving the game a better look, but if you want to \n\nstay true to the original, you can choose not to install it. The HD textures are \n\nwhat is normally used for Sven Co-op, and does NOT need to be installed for them to \n\nbe used in Sven Co-op. Sven Co-op comes with HD textures, and the maps themselves \n\nare configured for either using them, or not.\n\nBlue Shift sets you as Barney, a guard at Black Mesa, who must escape the compound.\n\nOpposing Force sets you as a Sergeant who was sent in to clean up the compound, \n\nbut crash landed on the way there. This one lasts quite longer than Blue Shift, \n\nand has quite a few more weapons.\n\nThis will NOT communicate with actual game servers - it's a cracked version. Local \n\n(LAN) play STILL works for all mods, just look up how to do it (Never forget \n\nsv_lan 1). Sven Co-op ready, and runs nicely. Using a flashlight seems to cause a \n\nbit of slow down, but other than that, it'll run fine on pretty much anything. Oh, \n\nand attempting to host a server using Sven Co-op that runs through the game \n\ncampaign (ONLY THE GAME CAMPAIGN, EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS) runs incredibly \n\nawkwardly, as deaths put you back at the beginning of the level, and joining at \n\nthe beginning puts you in the air. There's a Sven Co-op mod to allow Co-operative \n\nplay through the campaign, but it WILL NOT work with this. It does not detect a \n\nSTEAM-VERSION ONLY file.\n\n\nI've made a black wall! And it's falling apart at the seams!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2394c802b1086cf4bf53f383e9eed6d0f481cbe2","amp;dn":"Half-Life+plus+Blue+Shift+and+Opposing+Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2394c802b1086cf4bf53f383e9eed6d0f481cbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,148,200,2,177,8,108,244,191,83,243,131,233,238,214,208,244,129,203,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
