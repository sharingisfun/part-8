Bohemian Rhapsody and We Are the Champions are there -- as are Another One Bites the Dust and Don't Stop Me Now. Whichever track is your favorite, you'll be lining up to grab the mic and step into the trainers of the legendary Freddie Mercury to raise your living room roof. With stellar tracks from the '70s, '80s and '90s, SingStar Queen will rock SingStars who like to go solo, SingStars who like to duet and, quite possibly, the neighbors next door when they hear your performances coming through the wall!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e82846bb5d2323d5315ae787b4a8604150574d5","amp;dn":"SingStar%3A+Queen+%5BPS3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e82846bb5d2323d5315ae787b4a8604150574d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,130,132,107,181,210,50,61,83,21,174,120,123,74,134,4,21,5,116,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
