In this course, author and attorney Rich Stim covers the main language, concepts, clauses, and stipulations in four major types of contracts: recording, management, performance, and rights agreements.\n\nFor example, when it comes to record contracts, it's important to know how advances and royalties work, how to maintain creative control, and what happens when a member leaves a band. Rich also tackles management contracts, describing what managers can do for youÃ¢â‚¬â€and what to do when you need to let them go. Next, he explores the basic terms, riders, and payment options in performance contracts. Then learn about releases, artwork permissions, publishing and producer agreements, and other types of legal arrangements. Rich wraps up the course with a discussion of oral agreements, attorney fees and roles, and five basic rules worth remembering for every music contract.\nTopics include:\n\n    Why bother with a contract?\n    Understanding terms, options, royalties, and deductions\n    Making provisions for marketing\n    Including warranties and indemnity clauses\n    Hiring a manager\n    Understanding performance contracts\n    Getting permission to use samples\n    Creating a band partnership\n    Record keeping\n    Going through mediation or arbitration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9edd3f4bb8071067f938e615d13aef8f5632aba","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Music+Law%3A+Recording%2C+Management%2C+Rights%2C+and+Performanc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9edd3f4bb8071067f938e615d13aef8f5632aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,237,211,244,187,128,113,6,127,147,142,97,93,19,174,248,245,99,42,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
