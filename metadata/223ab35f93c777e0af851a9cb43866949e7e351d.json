I want this torrent to be valid for quite a while, so I've opted not to include an activator, but rather put a link here to MTK, where a future version may be required to activate on a newer version of Windows.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/28669-Microsoft-Toolkit-Official-KMS-Solution-for-Microsoft-Products&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/28669-Microsoft-Toolkit-Official-KMS-Solution-for-Microsoft-Products&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet the latest Microsoft Toolkit (KMS activator)\nUsage steps are unlikely to change so here's my recommendations:\n-Click Office button inside MTK\n-Click the Activation tab\n-Click the Install button on the AutoKMS dropdown\n-Click the Activate button on the right side of the program (not EZ-Activator)\n\nEZ-Activator's main purpose is to convert non-VL versions of Windows to gVLK supported versions, and doesn't apply to Office. Converting Office versions is actually sort-of complicated, but luckily, you clicked on a torrent that actually knows what he's doing.\n\nVL versions support both KMS activation and VolumeMAK activation. If you need a retail activation version, you might need to wait for digitalriver links to come up. Feel free to post a comment on a retail version link to an official site like digitalriver if the comment section allows it. Please don't post file hosting links. Direct from MS or go home, boys.\n\nThere is no retail activator, so don't waste your time looking for one.\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78 MDL/TPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:223ab35f93c777e0af851a9cb43866949e7e351d","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+ProPlus+2013+SP1+VL+x64+en-US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"223ab35f93c777e0af851a9cb43866949e7e351d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,58,179,95,147,199,119,224,175,133,26,156,180,56,102,148,158,126,53,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
