Joining the list of greats is Chris     |\n|   Lilley and his terrific 6-part mockumentary &quot;We Can Be Heroes: Finding     |\n|   the Australian of the Year&quot;.                                               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   In the tradition of &quot;Best in Show&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;, &quot;We Can Be    |\n|   Heroes&quot; follows the lives of several contestants, in this case, for the    |\n|   Australian of the Year award. Lilley plays all of the 5 nominees           |\n|   himself, and does a great job of showcasing his acting abilities, as       |\n|   well as brining life to some memorable characters, most of all school      |\n|   girl Ja'mie who really deserves a show of her own. Each of the nominees    |\n|   that Lilley plays are very different from one another. The outgoing        |\n|   Ricky, the stuck-up Ja'mie, the modest Pat, the arrogant Phil and the      |\n|   hilarious Daniel.                                                          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Each of the 5 nominees have all been nominated for various reasons, some   |\n|   more convincing than others, and some totally absurd. But that just adds   |\n|   to the humour of the show. The characters are not all likable, but it's    |\n|   better that way. Lilley is backed-up by a terrific group of supporting     |\n|   cast who play the friends and family of the nominees, and each of them     |\n|   do a great job given the short periods of time they are on screen for.     |\n|   The narration from Jennifer Byrne gives the show an authentic feel. A      |\n|   great show, would be awesome to see a second season with some outrageous   |\n|   new characters, or Ja'mie in her own show!    --boyinflares                |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n       +-----------+\n+------+ Movie Rip +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n|      +-----------+                                                           |\n|   Language(s) _____________ English                                          |\n|   Subtitle(s) _____________ None                                             |\n|   Feature Length __________ ~170 minutes                                     |\n|   Total Length ____________ ~335 minutes                                     |\n|   Vid Codec/Compr. ________ x264 [videolan.org/developers/x264.html]         |\n|   Video Stats _____________ 718*576 / 1.247:1 / 750kbps / 25.000 FPS         |\n|   Audio #1 Codec __________ AAC                                              |\n|   Audio #1 Stats __________ 160kbps / 48kHz / VBR / 16-bit / Stereo          |\n|   No. of Streams __________ 2: approx. 916kbps total                         |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nrainfo v0.2 [2011/06/10 @ 19:34:18]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e172910e380000fe6f2fc225f103f9a5e80f39","amp;dn":"We+Can+Be+Heroes+%282-DVD+Box+Set%29+%5BMKV%2Fx264%2FAAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e172910e380000fe6f2fc225f103f9a5e80f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,225,114,145,14,56,0,0,254,111,47,194,37,241,3,249,165,232,15,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
