This round-table discussion looks at the films themselves - not to mention the spies that star in them - and uses them as a lens on the British people, our fear of the world and our changing views of espionage over the decades.\n\nAs well as discussing the inevitable moral ambiguity, the limited female roles and general distrust of the intelligence community, we also find out what Dame Stella Rimington, the real M, actually thinks about James Bond, what you really say at a party when someone inevitably asks what you do, the spy gadget she'd really like to get her hands on, and the film that was genuinely used as a training movie when she first joined the service.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3c74555b547c700f120d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1293Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 609 MB\nSource: HDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f174f37c04df1485833931a86a7636cd8f62b00","amp;dn":"BBC.Al.Murrays.Great.British.Spy.Movies.576p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f174f37c04df1485833931a86a7636cd8f62b00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,23,79,55,192,77,241,72,88,51,147,26,134,167,99,108,216,246,43,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
