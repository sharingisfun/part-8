But he also knew not to simply go ahead and just rehash his debut for\nCross of Changes, resulting in a just different enough effort along the same overall lines.\nThe usual air of tasteful middle-of-the-road spirituality takes precedence, right down to the cover art\nand appropriately pantheistic quote from Persian mystic poet Rumi in the CD booklet. Needless to say,\nthe music attempts to match the same throughout, and often succeeds. Things kick off with more of\nthe synth-whale song noises and atmospherics from MCMXC, however there aren't any monks to be\nfound this time around, but what sounds like the same whispering woman talking about\n&quot;clearing the debts of many hundred years&quot; and the like. From there, Cretu merrily takes the same\nplunge -- some of his sample choices this time around show he's got a decent record collection,\nincluding parts from Songs From the Victorious City, the striking fusion of Egyptian and Western\nmusics from Anne Dudley and Jaz Coleman.\n\nHis work with beats and loops noticeably shows a more developed edge -- while hardly an innovator,\nthere's a bit more grime and loud in his rhythms, which in combination with extra electric guitar make\na reasonable contrast to the smoother elements. Consider the rampaging conclusion to\n&quot;I Love You...I'll Kill You,&quot; which while sharing some cheese with the title itself still works surprisingly well,\nright down to a clever Robert Plant vocal sample at the end. &quot;Return to Innocence&quot; was the big single\nfrom this one, not quite up there with &quot;Sadeness&quot; in the popular culture in the U.S. but almost inescapable\nelsewhere. There's another Led Zeppelin sample (this time John Bonham) and a haunting male vocal\nproviding oomph under the fuzzy-headed greeting card philosophy of the main lyrics. It's an impressive\neffort, showing Cretu had a definite something in his own way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnigma - The Cross Of Changes\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist....................................: Enigma\nAlbum.......................: The Cross Of Changes\nGenre..................,.................: New Age\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1993\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality.......: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags...............................: VorbisComment\n\nInformation..: Original 1993 UK &amp; European Pressing\n\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/9/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/9/2011\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n1.
