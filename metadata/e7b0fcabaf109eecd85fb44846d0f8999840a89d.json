On January 28th 2012, Totem Arts released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRenegade X: Black DawnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Black Dawn is a free, standalone, short 1-2 hour singleplayer game we have been preparing for quite some time now. Although most of Renegade XÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aspirations are in the multiplayer realm, in mid-2010, we decided that a short campaign would precede our upcoming standalone multiplayer beta.\n\nBlack Dawn is a demonstration of what is to come in the future. The release date of the final multiplayer version is still to be announced, and hence, we thought it would be good for you to have something to play while you wait. This demonstration is complete with a short 10-part campaign, custom cinematics and fantastic gameplay. It will be an opportunity for you to get used to all the weapons, vehicles, characters, and changes before the upcoming multiplayer release.\n\nYou can download and play Renegade X: Black Dawn today, for free!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b0fcabaf109eecd85fb44846d0f8999840a89d","amp;dn":"Renegade+X%3A+Operation+Black+Dawn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b0fcabaf109eecd85fb44846d0f8999840a89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,176,252,171,175,16,158,236,216,95,180,72,70,208,248,153,152,64,168,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
