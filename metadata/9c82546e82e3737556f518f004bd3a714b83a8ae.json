The Spirit Level, based on thirty years \n\nof research, takes this truth a step further. One common factor links the healthiest \n\nand happiest societies: the degree of equality among their members. Further, more \n\nunequal societies are bad for everyone within them-the rich and middle class as well \n\nas the poor.\n\nThe remarkable data assembled in The Spirit Level exposes stark differences, not only \n\namong the nations of the first world but even within America's fifty states. Almost \n\nevery modern social problem-poor health, violence, lack of community life, teen \n\npregnancy, mental illness-is more likely to occur in a less-equal society.\n\nRenowned researchers Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett lay bare the contradictions \n\nbetween material success and social failure in the developed world. But they do not \n\nmerely tell us what's wrong. They offer a way toward a new political outlook, \n\nshifting from self-interested consumerism to a friendlier, more sustainable society.\n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c82546e82e3737556f518f004bd3a714b83a8ae","amp;dn":"Spirit+Level+-+Why+Greater+Equality+Makes+Societies++-+Wilkinson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c82546e82e3737556f518f004bd3a714b83a8ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,130,84,110,130,227,115,117,86,245,24,240,4,189,58,113,75,131,168,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
