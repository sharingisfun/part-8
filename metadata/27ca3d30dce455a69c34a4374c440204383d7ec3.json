Stone finds events of the period attributable to the interacting pressures of international and domestic politics on those national leaders attempting to govern France and to modernize its institutions. He contends that the Revolution of 1789-1799 needs to be viewed in the larger contexts of &quot;early modern&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; French history and modern &quot;progressive&quot; sociopolitical revolutions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ca3d30dce455a69c34a4374c440204383d7ec3","amp;dn":"Reinterpreting+the+French+Revolution+-Stone%2C+Bailey+%5BNon-Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ca3d30dce455a69c34a4374c440204383d7ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,202,61,48,220,228,85,166,156,52,164,55,76,68,2,4,56,61,126,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
