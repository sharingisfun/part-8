Nailed-down cyberpunk a la William Gibson for the 21st century meets the vivid dark futures of Al Reynolds in this extraordinary debut novel.\n\nWith Earth abandoned, humanity resides on Station, an industrialised asteroid run by the sentient corporations of the Pantheon. Under their leadership a war has been raging against the Totality - ex-Pantheon AIs gone rogue.\n\nWith the war over, Jack Forster and his sidekick, Hugo Fist, a virtual puppet tied to Jack's mind and created to destroy the Totality, have returned home.\n\nLabelled a traitor for surrendering to the Totality, all Jack wants is to clear his name, but when he discovers two old friends have died under suspicious circumstances he also wants answers. Soon he and Fist are embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens not only their future but all of humanity's.\n\nBut with Fist's software licence about to expire, taking Jack's life with it, can they bring down the real traitors before their time runs out?\n\n\nRead by Thomas Judd\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bfd87f384c527c7a2765a6c008e9f1965cfe7b","amp;dn":"Al+Robertson+-+Crashing+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bfd87f384c527c7a2765a6c008e9f1965cfe7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,191,216,127,56,76,82,124,122,39,101,166,192,8,233,241,150,92,254,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
