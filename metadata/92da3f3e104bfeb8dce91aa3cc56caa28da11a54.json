The &quot;KJ&quot; part of his name refers to his old rap alias, &quot;King J. Mac,&quot; a name which he later described in one of his podcasts as &quot;horribly cheesy.&quot; &quot;52&quot;, which is pronounced &quot;five two&quot;, not &quot;fifty-two&quot;, is a reference to the Biblical story of Jesus feeding the multitude with five loaves and two fish, which is also sung about in his song &quot;Push Up&quot; from The Yearbook and in the &quot;KJ Five Two&quot; on It's Pronounced 'Five Two'.
