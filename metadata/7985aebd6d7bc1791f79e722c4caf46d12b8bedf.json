With the auto industry careening toward ruin, Congress offered all three Detroit automakers a bailout. General Motors and Chrysler grabbed the taxpayer lifeline, but Ford decided to save itself. Under the leadership of charismatic CEO Alan Mulally, Ford had already put together a bold plan to unify its divided global operations, transform its lackluster product lineup, and overcome a dysÃ‚Â­functional culture of infighting, backstabbing, and excuses. It was an extraordinary risk, but it was the only way the Ford familyÃ¢â‚¬â€AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last great industrial dynastyÃ¢â‚¬â€could hold on to their company. \nMulally and his team pulled off one of the greatÃ‚Â­est comebacks in business history. As the rest of Detroit collapsed, Ford went from the brink of bankruptcy to being the most profitable automaker in the world. \nAmerican Icon is the compelling, behind-the-scenes account of that epic turnaround. On the verge of collapse, Ford went outside the auto industry and recruited MulallyÃ¢â‚¬â€the man who had already saved Boeing from the deathblow of 9/11Ã¢â‚¬â€to lead a sweeping restructuring of a company that had been unable to overcome decades of mismanageÃ‚Â­ment and denial. Mulally applied the principles he developed at Boeing to streamline FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inefficient operations, force its fractious executives to work together as a team, and spark a product renaissance in Dearborn. He also convinced the United Auto Workers to join his fight for the soul of American manufacturing. \nBryce Hoffman reveals the untold story of the covert meetings with UAW leaders that led to a game-changing contract, Bill FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle to hold the Ford family together when many were ready to cash in their stock and write off the company, and the secret alliance with Toyota and Honda that helped prop up the AmerÃ‚Â­ican automotive supply base. \nIn one of the great management narratives of our time, Hoffman puts the reader inside the boardroom as Mulally uses his celebrated Business Plan Review meetÃ‚Â­ings to drive change and force Ford to deal with the painful realities of the American auto industry. \nHoffman was granted unprecedented access to FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top executives and top-secret company documents. He spent countless hours with Alan Mulally, Bill Ford, the Ford family, former executives, labor leaders, and company directors. In the bestselling tradition of Too Big to Fail and The Big Short, American Icon is narrative nonfiction at its vivid and colorful best.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Business&gt; Biography \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7985aebd6d7bc1791f79e722c4caf46d12b8bedf","amp;dn":"American+Icon+-+Bryce+G.+Hoffman.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7985aebd6d7bc1791f79e722c4caf46d12b8bedf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,133,174,189,109,123,193,121,31,121,231,34,196,202,244,109,18,184,190,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
