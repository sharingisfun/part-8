I'm not entirely sure when\r\nthe re-enable thing happens, but I know I've seen it happen\r\nafter enabling internet on a new install.\r\n\r\nRecent Change/Integration Notes:\r\n-Removed Education version. SRY if you use it\r\n-Enterprise and netfx3 seems to make it want to download update.\r\nI weighed my options and decided it's still good as it is.\r\nIf you're not okay with this, you might try just using the\r\nFeb updated MSDN iso files.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTICE*\r\n-I have no idea if this torrent will work. If it does,\r\nI may consider doing updated versions occasionally, though\r\nlikely not nearly as often as every month. My Internet is crap.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit KMS Activator\r\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design, Script and testing\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aae9473b3a31f9314147a5aedbc1a9f32c777c89","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+10+x64+4in1+en-US+Mar2016+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aae9473b3a31f9314147a5aedbc1a9f32c777c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,233,71,59,58,49,249,49,65,71,165,174,219,193,169,243,44,119,124,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
