Just use a Health potion or W skill\n\t\tand keep whacking away. \n\n\t\t&lt;Very Important!!!!!!&gt;\n\t\tDO NOT END THE GAME BEFORE 5MINS!! - Yes, This is very likely and what you are shooting for and can be easily done. You won't get near the xp if you do. Wait to blow up the nexus\n\t\tuntil after the 5 min mark.\n\n\t\tGame Length: Typically 5-7mins per game\n\t\tXP: Currently Getting 100+ xp per game with only 3Day XP Boost\n\n\t\t&lt;Alternative&gt;\n\t\tIf you are skilled and have buddies you can do a 3v3 Intermediate Bot Twisted Treeline Game using all AD Ranged (Ashe, Vayne, Sivir, etc...) and follow same principal for even more xp. Same \n\t\tRules above still apply though!!! Do not end game before 5 min mark.\n\n\t4) Rinse and Repeat - Should take you about 1 Day to reach it, or faster depending on your effeciency and if you do intermediate bot games or not as you get more xp for harder games.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5783bc975528a5cd1e17aa9e79b27d75eee8a28b","amp;dn":"League+of+Legends+RP+Hack+-+Updated%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5783bc975528a5cd1e17aa9e79b27d75eee8a28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,131,188,151,85,40,165,205,30,23,170,158,121,178,125,117,238,232,162,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
