Robbins argues that Custer's undoing was his bold and cocky attitude, which caused the Army's bloodiest defeat in the Indian Wars.\n\n\nRobbins also dives into CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal life, exploring his letters and other personal documents to reveal who he was as a person, underneath the military leader. The Real Custer is an exciting and valuable contribution to the legend and history of Custer that will delight Custer fans as well as readers new to the legend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b2d85299ebc69bcfc02ae953c4862bbd252394","amp;dn":"The+Real+Custer-+Robbins%2C+2014+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b2d85299ebc69bcfc02ae953c4862bbd252394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,178,216,82,153,235,198,155,207,192,42,233,83,196,134,43,189,37,35,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
