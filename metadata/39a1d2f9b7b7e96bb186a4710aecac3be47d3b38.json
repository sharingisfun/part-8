From precise selective enhancements using HueSelect Control Points to global SmartColor adjustments that improve the entire image, iCorrect EditLab Pro lets you spend more time behind your camera and less time in front of your computer.\n\nFrustration-Free Color Correction with Professional Results\n\n The hallmark of iCorrect EditLab Pro is its SmartColor Technology. The term SmartColor actually encompasses two distinct, yet related features. First, the SmartColor button provides an auto-correction function by analyzing the photo and making initial adjustments to color balance, tonal range, exposure, and saturation. Second, it refers to the way the underlying technology handles color and light in such a way that preserves and protects any adjustments you make as you progress through the the four tool sets.. iCorrect EditLab Pro has four color editing tools arranged in a particular sequence. The tool sets are designed in such a way that as you progress from left to right, any changes you make with one tool will not, and in fact cannot, affect any of the changes made with any of the tools to its left. This alleviates the common frustration of correcting for one thing while throwing off another - aka &quot;chasing your tail&quot; syndrome.\n\n\n  \t Color Balance: Quickly perfect the color balance of your images by setting the white balance and removing color casts by simply clicking on any neutral (black, white or gray) colors in your image.  Or you can adjust with sliders for CMY or Color Temperature  - NEW\n\n\n  \t Tonal Range: Precisely control the tonal range of your images by individually setting the white point, black point and midpoint of your images using familiar eye dropper, sliders, and automatic SmartColor technology.\n\n\n  \t Brightness/Contrast/Saturation: Precisely control the brightness ,contrast and saturation of your images by individually targeting highlights and shadows using sliders and automatic SmartColor technology.\n\n\n  \t HueSelectTM Control Point Technology: Perform precise hue-selective edits on your images and automatically correct familiar memory colors like Sky Blue, Foliage Green, and Skin Tones, plus convert to black and white or sepia tone while controlling the contrast and detail based on the colors in the original image.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Copy Crack to Photoshop Plugins\n- Use serial to rewgister\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/83393046773612879499.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/83393046773612879499.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a1d2f9b7b7e96bb186a4710aecac3be47d3b38","amp;dn":"PictoColor+iCorrect+EditLab+Pro+6.0.%5BENG%5D%5BPhotoshop+Plugin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a1d2f9b7b7e96bb186a4710aecac3be47d3b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,161,210,249,183,183,233,107,177,134,164,113,10,236,172,59,228,125,59,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
