This has been fixed. \n- Sometimes the game would crash after removing old bullet holes/scratch marks in the world. This has been fixed. \n- Sometimes when a player or enemy was sitting in the jeep gunner entry and got killed, his body would rest on the vehicle in such a way that the physics simulation would require lots of CPU usage. This has been solved. \n- Fixed a crash occurring on Flood Zone when playing Conquest Large. \n- Fixed a common crash relating to surface shaders. \n- Fixed a crash on Test Range that could occur when using sniper rifles. \n- Fixed a common crash that occurred during map transition. \n- Fixed a crash that occurred when bringing up Battlescreen in-game on the Test Range. \n- Fixed a memory allocation bug that could lead to crashing. \n- Fixed a single player crash that could sometimes occur when being killed by AI enemies. \n- Fixed an issue where the game would get stuck in infinite loading if you got disconnected while trying to access online content. \n- Fixed an issue in single player in the South China Sea mission where the game would crash when idle for more than 60 minutes. \n- Fixed an issue where the game would get stuck in infinite loading if you used Win+L to lock your PC during loading. \n\nNETWORK PERFORMANCE \nEliminated a network sync bug \nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been experiencing situations in multiplayer where it appears that you are taking damage from enemies through walls, you might have been the victim of a network sync bug. In this game update, we have identified and eliminated one such bug that caused this type of gameplay experience. We are continuing to work on more multiplayer optimizations concerning network performance. \n\nImproved Network Smoothing \nWe have made some improvements to the Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Network SmoothingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ functionality that you can find in the OPTIONS&gt;GAMEPLAY menu. The Network Smoothing slider governs a group of settings that aim to produce a tighter multiplayer experience based on your specific packet loss situation. \n\nRemoved network lag \nIn certain specific situations, network lag would be introduced when interacting with objects in the game. This has been experienced by some players during melee combat, when climbing ladders, and when operating stationary weapons. The cause for these specific network lag situations has been solved. \n\nGAMEPLAY BALANCING \n- Removed the scout helicopter at the final base for the defenders in Rush mode on Siege of Shanghai \n- Adjusted a Conquest flag position on Zavod 311 that was obstructing vehicles. \n- At Hainan Resort in Rush mode, defenders were given too much armor at the first base.
