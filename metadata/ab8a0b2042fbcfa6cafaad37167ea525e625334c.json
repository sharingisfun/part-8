They begin an affair encumbered by her job, his lack of money, and their pasts: Beaty has a ten-year-old son who lives with her ex, and she has a dangerous former boyfriend; Emory has a wife who died in questionable circumstances and a shady friend who shows up with a scheme for making lots of money. Beaty and Emory want to sort things out, but the odds are against them. Life is no cabaret. (Helen Mirren).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8a0b2042fbcfa6cafaad37167ea525e625334c","amp;dn":"Hussy.1980.H.Mirren.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8a0b2042fbcfa6cafaad37167ea525e625334c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,138,11,32,66,251,207,166,202,250,173,55,22,126,165,37,230,37,51,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
