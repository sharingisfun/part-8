During her adventures we also get to meet her talking backpack (or la mochila) and the map who sings an annoyingly cute song. The show plays out almost like a computer adventure showing a mouse on different scenes where the kids make a decision. Dora asks your kids questions and then waits for a response. The main purpose of the show is to teach Spanish to English-speaking children.\nGenres: Adventure | Animation | Family\nFormat : AVI at 2279 Kbps\nLength : 350 MiB for 21mn 27s 53ms\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual at 2139 Kbps\nAspect : 640 x 480 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos : 2 ÃŽÂºÃŽÂ±ÃŽÂ½ÃŽÂ¬ÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ¹ÃŽÂ±, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882d4118911309944112c1f67aec755b54aab214","amp;dn":"Dora+the+explorer+n1+Greek+audio+dubbed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882d4118911309944112c1f67aec755b54aab214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,45,65,24,145,19,9,148,65,18,193,246,122,236,117,91,84,170,178,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
