B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled A Game of Thrones. Filmed in a Belfast studio and on location elsewhere in Northern Ireland, Malta, Croatia, Iceland, and Morocco, it premiered on HBO in the United States on 17 April 2011.\n\nThe series, set in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves several plot lines. The first follows the members of several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising threat of the impending winter and the mythical creatures of the North; the third chronicles the attempts of the exiled last scion of the realm's deposed dynasty to reclaim the throne. Through its morally ambiguous characters, the series explores issues of social hierarchy, religion, civil war, sexuality, crime and punishment. It is the most recent big-budget work to have contributed to the popularity of the fantasy genre in mainstream media.[5]\n\nHighly anticipated since its early stages of development, Game of Thrones has received universal acclaim by critics, although its use of nudity has been criticized. The series has won numerous awards and nominations Ã¢â‚¬â€ including two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Television Series Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drama, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in Long Form, and a Peabody Award. Among the ensemble cast, Peter Dinklage won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Tyrion Lannister.\n\nTV series links\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/\nWiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_%28TV_series%29\nOfficial site: http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html\n\nBook Links\nGeorge R.R.
