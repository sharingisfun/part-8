The P30CH was also the first Amtrak diesel locomotive built from the factory that offered Head End Power (HEP), supplied by auxiliary powerplants and alternators. \n\nAs the first Amtrak diesels equipped with HEP, the Pooches first went to work hauling short-distance Amfleet-equipped trains, then were also employed on select long-distance trains such as the Chicago-New Orleans Panama Limited and the Washington, D.C.-Savannah (Georgia) segment of the Palmetto. With AmtrakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision to standardize on the Electro-Motive F40PH, the P30CH was destined to become an orphan in a world of F40PHs, a fact exemplified by AmtrakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness to lease the Pooches to the Southern Pacific in 1978 for Bay Area commuter service. \n\nBut the big P30CHs found a pair of regular homes that extended their operational lives into the early 1990s. One of those regular assignments was AmtrakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Los Angeles-New Orleans Sunset Limited, which called upon pairs of the Pooches to make the nearly 2,000-mile run across the American southwest. And the other was AmtrakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Auto-Train operation between Lorton, Virginia and Sanford, Florida. The P30CHs were finally retired in 1992. \n\nThe GE P30CH for Train Simulator recreates the locomotive in AmtrakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Phase IIIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ livery and features of the model include dynamic braking, rear and forward headlight control, gyralight, and classification lights. \n\nAlso included are a Phase III-liveried Amfleet II coach, Amfleet CafÃƒÂ©/Lounge, a Heritage Baggage car, Heritage Diner, and Heritage Dome-Coach","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7790d9964100bc395f65e0c8dc8ffc5fb191963","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015++Amtrak+P30CH+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7790d9964100bc395f65e0c8dc8ffc5fb191963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,121,13,153,100,16,11,195,149,246,94,12,141,200,255,197,251,25,25,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
