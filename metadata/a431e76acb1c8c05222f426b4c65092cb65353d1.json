File names &amp; numbering have been standardised and works spanning several CDs have been renamed to fit into one folder.\n\nNotes: The Peter Grimes recording has won the Penguin Guide's Rosette\n\nReview of Peter Grimes: Pear's heart-rending portrayal of Grimes central to a magnificent cast - James Jolly, Gramophone 1000th issue\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ...a studio has rarely witnessed anything so poignant as [Pears's] singing of the mad scene in the last Act. It is almost unbearably moving...The Covent Garden Orchestra rise superbly to their task and indeed one is left with an impression of the entire cast, of everybody concerned, being inspired by the presence and direction of the composer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gramophone Magazine, October 1959\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Decca set, which in 1958 introduced this opera to many listeners, has never been superseded in its refinement or insight. Britten's conducting, lithe and lucid, reveals his work as a complex, ambiguous drama. Peter Pears, in the title-role written for him, brings unsurpassed detail of nuance to Grimes's words while never losing sight of the essential plainness of the man's speech. The rest of the cast form a vivid portrait gallery of characters.\n\nThe recording is as live and clear as if it had been made yesterday, and takes the listener right onto the stage. The bustle of activity and sound effects realise nicely Britten's own masterly painting of dramatic foreground and background.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gramophone Classical Music Guide, 2010\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a431e76acb1c8c05222f426b4c65092cb65353d1","amp;dn":"Benjamin+Britten+Conducts+Britten+%28Volumes+1-4%29+-+35CDs+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a431e76acb1c8c05222f426b4c65092cb65353d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,49,231,106,203,28,140,5,34,47,66,107,76,101,9,44,182,83,83,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
