This CD/DVD/Blu-ray burning application makes it extremely\neasy to create &amp; copy your own data, video, audio, and multisession CDs,\nas well as DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  Many current CD/DVD burning programs\nare universal (they include just about everything except the kitchen sink)\napplications that are overloaded with countless confusing functions.\nAshampoo Burning Studio 6.40 makes life easier by concentrating on what\nyou really want to do.\n\n\nWhat?s new:\n- Multi-disc file backup and restore on CDs, DVDs and Blu-Ray discs.\n- Create compressed backup archives with powerful password protection.\n- Split archives automatically across multiple CDs, DVDs or Blu-Ray discs.\n- Restore archive contents to their original locations.\n- Integrated Audio CD ripper ? store your audio tracks as WMA or WAV files.\n- New option for setting the number of copies you want to burn (available\n  for all disc formats).\n- Discs can now be verified immediately without being ejected first (IF the\n  drive supports this feature)\n- Numerous other small improvements that make the program easier to use and\n  more effective\n\n  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n                   Installation/Registration Instructions\n\nThis is the latest, greatest version of Ashampoo Burning Studio.  You can\ninstall and use it for a limited 10 day trial period, ... install and use it\nfor an extended trial period (40 days I think), .... or install and use it as\na fully registered application.\n\nTo install:\nExtract the files, then double-click &quot; ashampoo_burningstudio640_se.exe&quot; to start\nthe installation process.  Once the installation process is finished you can choose\nto do one of three things.  When ABS-640 is started up for the first\ntime, you can use it in the following ways:\n\n1) 10 day trial:\n   Just run it as is, and you&amp;#039;ll have a 10 day trial period.\n\n2) Extended Trial:\n   Register with Ashampoo and receive a key number you can enter to extend your\n   trial period to 40 days.\n   a) To receive the extended trial key, CLICK &quot;Help&gt;Register...&quot;. You&amp;#039;re\n      browser will open the Ashampoo website to register ABS-640.  With\n      registration, you&amp;#039;re sent the extended trial key number by email\n NOTE: (This is the number you&amp;#039;ll be sent. &quot;BS07A0-770098-0000A0&quot;).\n   b) Enter the key given you by following the directions that come with the\n      registration email, and you&amp;#039;ll have your trial extention.\n\n3) It&amp;#039;s Yours:\n   To make ABS-640 fully functional (remove the Trial time bomb), use the\n   included Keygen (&quot;kg-ABS-6.40.exe&quot; Thanks to &quot;Black Riders&quot;) to generate your\n   own unique activation number, then enter the number where required.\n   \n NOTE: If for some reason you used the extended extended trial number, the easiest\n       way to enter your own generated number is to just use the application until\n       the trial period ends.  When the trial period ends, you&amp;#039;ll start getting\n       the usual &quot;trial is over&quot; nag when you start it up.  You&amp;#039;ll also have an \n       option to enter your activation number.  Enter the generated number and\n       your good to go.\n \n NOTE: A Patch for the ABS-640 is also included, but I&amp;#039;ve had no need to use\n       it yet.  I&amp;#039;m not sure if it&amp;#039;s really needed, but IF for some reason, the\n       key-generated number stops working, the patch is there to give it a try. \n    \n\n                          ENJOY!!!  \n     \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c66de8403f88177c574141e0a0205c0be4a22aac","amp;dn":"Ashampo+Burning+Studio+6.40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c66de8403f88177c574141e0a0205c0be4a22aac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,109,232,64,63,136,23,124,87,65,65,224,160,32,92,11,228,162,42,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
