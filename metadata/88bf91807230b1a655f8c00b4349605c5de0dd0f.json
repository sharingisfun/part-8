In other countries, it \nwas released in 1989 as &quot;Themes&quot; on a single CD, though the tracklist was \nslightly different, and &quot;Eric's theme&quot; and &quot;Mouettes&quot; were added in Spain.  \nIt's funny, as both CDs from this spanish CD could fit on a single CD.\n\nFollowing you'll find the Allmusic review for Themes, which is the closest I've\nfound to a review for this one (in english).\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW FOR THEMES\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReview\tby Mike DeGagne\n\nThemes is one of the most entertaining and thorough of any of Vangelis' \ncollections, with excerpts spanning such albums as Opera Sauvage, China, and the \never-popular Chariots of Fire release from 1981. Most of the selections from \nThemes speak for Vangelis' movie contributions, including the infamous &quot;Chariots \nof Fire&quot; track as well as the lonesome-sounding theme from Missing and the \npowerful openings from Mutiny on the Bounty. With this music, Vangelis has \nimplemented some variations in rhythm and some noticeable fluctuation in his \nsynthesizer work, making these tracks much more colorful and animated than his \nnew age meanderings of the '70s. Also, his ability to cast visual imagery \nthrough his keyboard playing is represented by many of these excerpts, but \nproven best on tracks like &quot;Antarctica,&quot; in which the white, barren wasteland is \nconjured up perfectly through his wispy synthesized textures, and then again on \n&quot;End Titles From Bladerunner,&quot; which was previously unreleased, simulating the \nimpersonal, android-like world in which the movie was based. Both of his cuts \nfrom China include oriental-flavored backdrops, while Bladerunner's love theme \nremains one of Vangelis' most beautiful pieces. Themes is a definitive purchase \nas far as compilations are concerned, since a majority of his best material lies \nin the 14 tracks. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bf91807230b1a655f8c00b4349605c5de0dd0f","amp;dn":"Vangelis+-+The+Best+Of+%282+CD+Spanish+Exclusive%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bf91807230b1a655f8c00b4349605c5de0dd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,191,145,128,114,48,177,166,85,248,192,11,67,73,96,92,93,224,221,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
