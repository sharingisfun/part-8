To celebrate, they re-recorded some of their best tunes, wrote a new one, and released the results on the plainly titled 25th Anniversary. Fans who know these songs, &quot;96 Degrees in the Shade,&quot; the Stevie Wonder-penned &quot;Try Jah Love,&quot; their hit cover of &quot;Now That We Found Love,&quot; and &quot;Sense of Purpose,&quot; will find the new recordings interesting, but will pine to hear the originals. &quot;Jamaica,&quot; the new track written for this release, is a solid if light tribute to the band's homeland. They also recorded a new cover song, Neil Diamond's &quot;Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon,&quot; and, as part of the special-edition package, included three remixes as well. ~ Wade Kergan\n\nAudio Mixer: Dan Geary.\n\nAudio Remixers: Mike &quot;DaMooch&quot; Mucci; Elementary.\n\nLiner Note Author: Roger Kash.\n\nRecording information: Sky View Studios, Miami, FL.\n\nIllustrator: Sean Weeks.\n\nPhotographers: Robert Fein; Robert Younis.\n\nArranger: Third World.\n\nThird World: William &quot;Bunny Rugs&quot; Clarke (vocals); Richie Daley (bass guitar); Rupert Bent, Jr., Lenworth &quot;Ruption&quot; Williams, Steven &quot;Cat&quot; Coore, Herbert Herbie Harris.\n\nPersonnel: William &quot;Bunny&quot; Clarke (vocals); Steven &quot;Cat&quot; Coore (guitar); Rupert Bent, Jr., Herbert Herbie Harris (keyboards); Lenworth &quot;Ruption&quot; Williams (drums); \n\n\nThe Band (background vocals).\n\n\n\n\nThird World 25th Anniversary (Special Edition) Album Track Listing\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. 96 Degrees in the Shade \n 2.
