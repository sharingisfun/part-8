An amazing album but the only torrent for this album on TPB is broken. I will seed it for as long as humanly possible. Enjoy!\n\n\n[From wikipedia]\nNineteen Ninety Now is a 2010 album from underground hip hop artist Celph Titled and Buckwild. The concept of the album came about as Celph Titled and the executive producer James &quot;DL&quot; Ellison of No Sleep Recording came up with the idea of making an album over nothing but unheard beats by Buckwild Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of Celph Titled's favorite producers of the 1990s. Buckwild, who also was signed to No Sleep Recordings, was with the idea and started going through old boxes of DATs and floppy discs to dig up the best of his unreleased material from the period of 1994 and 1995.\nAfter Celph Titled and Buck decided on their favorites they started putting the album together. They also brought in Mista Sinista of The X-Ecutioners do the scratches and cuts on the album and filled it up with additional guest verses from Sadat X, Grand Puba, Esoteric, Apathy, Chino XL, Vinnie Paz, Majik Most, F.T., Ryu, R.A. The Rugged Man, Treach of Naughty By Nature and D.I.T.C. members O.C., Diamond D and AG. In December 2010 the album was named the &quot;Slept-On&quot; album of the year by Hip-Hop news website HipHopDX.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf7b3d6f3d558c1fff49dc4c76480640011d219","amp;dn":"Celph+Titled+%26amp%3B+Buckwild+-+Nineteen+Ninety+Now+%5BFIXED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf7b3d6f3d558c1fff49dc4c76480640011d219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,247,179,214,243,213,88,193,255,244,157,196,199,100,128,100,0,17,210,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
