The second edition of Neonatal Orthopaedics examines orthopaedics problems in neonates, focussing on antenatal diagnostic measures, diagnostic points and salient features of each disorder. The book begins with an introduction to the general aspects of neonatal orthopaedics, discussing anatomy and physiology, antenatal diagnosis, genetics, skeletal and muscular disorders and birth injuries. The following sections describe various disorders found in different parts of the neonate body - lower limb, vertebral, upper limb and shoulder. Each chapter discusses in detail conditions that may be encountered, describing their etiology, clinical features, differential diagnosis and treatment. Keywords for each chapter have also been included. The final sections discuss neonatal infections and miscellaneous conditions including tetanus, gangrene, conjoined twins and rheumatic disorders.
