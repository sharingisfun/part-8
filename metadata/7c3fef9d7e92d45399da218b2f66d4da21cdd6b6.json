Aptly titled ?The Hard Road: Restrung,? it has seen Hilltop Hoods return to the studio to re-compose the entire album with the assistance of arranger Jamie Messenger, incorporating the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra (ASO).\n\nHilltop Hoods is renowned for their incomparable live sets and the quality of their show has always been of the utmost importance to Hilltop Hoods. It was when considering how to improve and expand on their performance that they conceived the idea of incorporating an orchestra into their set.\n\nThis evolved to the concept of recording ?The Hard Road: Restrung? and, after having worked with the ASO String Quartet at the 2006 ARIA Awards as well as The Falls and Southbound Festivals, they were the natural choice for Hilltop Hoods.\n\nThe combination of these two forces has resulted in ?The Hard Road: Restrung? boldly taking the original tracks on this album both musically and creatively to another level. To accommodate this innovative approach, certain tracks have been adapted and re-worked to create this dynamic 14 track album. Expect to hear new verses from Hilltop Hoods, a brand new bonus track called ?Roll On Up,? as well as a new guest feature from US freestyle champ, Okwerdz, working with the Hoods to reinvent ?Conversations From A Speakeasy.?\n\nThe standout track ?Recapturing The Vibe? has long been a firm favourite of the public. The Restrung version has been transformed into a stunt filled, doco style film clip which is a dynamic contrast to the backdrop of the harmonious strings.\n\nRipped to 192kps Constant Bit Rate...
