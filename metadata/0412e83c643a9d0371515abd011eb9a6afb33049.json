As you can probably guess from their name, the ensemble was an Egyptian one -- working at the end of the 60s in an incredible blend of jazz and more traditional Egyptian-styled sounds -- a blend that comes across with all the exotic feel of the pyramids at dawn, but which manages to groove like some of the best funky work from America at the time! Instrumentation includes lot of percussion, heavy piano and horns, and some especially great flute on most tracks -- all coming together with a sound that's unlike anything else we've heard before. This collection is the first time that this music has been brought together officially, all with the kind of top-shelf production and packaging we've come to expect from the Art Yard label! LP version includes the tracks:\n \n&quot;Egypt Strut&quot;, \n&quot;Ramadan In Space Time&quot;, \n&quot;Dawn&quot;, \n&quot;Neveen&quot;, \n&quot;Oriental Mood&quot;, \n&quot;Kleopatra&quot;\n&quot;Mervat&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=mv46nrjsfp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=mv46nrjsfp&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSEED !!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0412e83c643a9d0371515abd011eb9a6afb33049","amp;dn":"Salah+Ragab+%26+The+Cairo+Jazz+Band+Present+Egyptian+Jazz+--+Ramad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0412e83c643a9d0371515abd011eb9a6afb33049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,18,232,60,100,58,157,3,113,81,90,189,1,30,185,166,175,179,48,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
