Foyle  \n                    visits James Deveraux in his cell and and finds  \n                    a damaged young man intent on self destruction.  \n                    With time running out, he desperately searches  \n                    for any evidence to clear Deveraux's name. This  \n                    case means more to Foyle than any that he has  \n                    previously undertaken and what he discovers  \n                    shakes his personal world to the core.   \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a8865de0f56c38e8b298dcb6d233f2e2cd14351","amp;dn":"Foyles.War.S07E03.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a8865de0f56c38e8b298dcb6d233f2e2cd14351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,136,101,222,15,86,195,142,139,41,141,203,109,35,63,46,44,209,67,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
