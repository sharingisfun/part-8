It started life as a work for violin, and \nwas then arranged for lute. Now in a modern adaptation is appears in an arrangement \nfor guitar. The work has become one of the composer's best known, the Gavotte third \nmovement being performed in many guises. The Sonata by Ponce was composed in 1929, \nand pays homage to the music of Franz Schubert. In four contrasting movements, it is \nengaging music of a lyrical nature, happy in general mood, but is in no way derivative \nof the famous composer. \nThe works by TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rrega are typically colourful Spanish scores, packed full of virtuosity \nand vivacity. They are late 19th century in general style, and would have been used by \nthe composer to please his audience. The three works by Sulek would meet our expectations \nof a composer who looked musically backwards. Walton, on the other hand, wrote five short \nmovements that bristle with technical difficulties, the score residing in the mainstream \nof the 20th century. \nmuzik62\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTracks:\n01-06 Partita in E major, BWV 1006a (trans.
