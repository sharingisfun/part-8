Some of you may argue that it is biased towards &quot;Fox News Channel&quot;(FNC). But, the real question that I would want to raise is: Is FNC a biased cable news broadcasting company? If so, how biased is it? Of course, I let you decide. So, enjoy this great movie! :)\n\nFor your information, this documentary has possibly already been posted here earlier. Not that I&amp;#039;m aware of it. But, since I still like this movie, I will certainly share it with you! Also, I want to clarify that I&amp;#039;ve not done any ripping or otherwise modified the content of the file, in contrast to my previous torrent upload. The only thing I&amp;#039;ve done is to download it off the Net, using \nDirectConnect. The quality should, however, be good. Just drop a message or PM me for further questions/thoughts related to this subject. \n\nCreds to all seeders out there! :) Knowledge is power!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Title: &quot;OUTFOXED: Rupert Murdoch&amp;#039;s War on Journalism&quot;\nRelease Date  : July 13, 2004\nPlaying Time  : 01:17:41\nLanguage      : English (No Subtitle)\nFile Format   : AVI / DivX\nAudio Desc.   : Bit Rate (95kbps), Format (MPEG Layer-3)\nVideo Desc.   : 23 frames/s, Data Rate (149kbps), Sample Size (24bit)\nOfficial Site : http://www.outfoxed.org/\nTrailer Link  : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w39FnpuMRfo\nIMDb Info Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418038/\nTools/Programs: Not Available\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Outfoxed&quot; examines how media empires, led by Rupert Murdoch&amp;#039;s Fox News, have been running a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in television news. This film provides an in-depth look at Fox News and the dangers of ever-enlarging corporations taking control of the public&amp;#039;s right to know.\n\nThe film explores Murdoch&amp;#039;s burgeoning kingdom and the impact on society when a broad swath of media is controlled by one person.\n\nMedia experts, including Jeff Cohen (FAIR) Bob McChesney (Free Press), Chellie Pingree (Common Cause), Jeff Chester (Center for Digital Democracy) and David Brock (Media Matters) provide context and guidance for the story of Fox News and its effect on society.\n\nThis documentary also reveals the secrets of Former Fox news producers, reporters, bookers and writers who expose what it&amp;#039;s like to work for Fox News. These former Fox employees talk about how they were forced to push a &quot;right-wing&quot; point of view or risk their jobs. Some have even chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect their current livelihoods. As one employee said &quot;There&amp;#039;s no sense of integrity as far as having a line that can&amp;#039;t be crossed.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d963e62d12f3d8c6f50a66042654030b81771d93","amp;dn":"OUTFOXED%3A+Rupert+Murdoch%5C%27s+War+on+Journalism+%5BDivX_2004-JF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d963e62d12f3d8c6f50a66042654030b81771d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,99,230,45,18,243,216,198,245,10,102,4,38,84,3,11,129,119,29,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
