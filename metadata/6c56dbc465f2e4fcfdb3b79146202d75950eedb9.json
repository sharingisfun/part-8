The evolution of this insight is the explosion we see today of networking groups. Businesses and business people alike understand the importance and potential of networking. \n\nUnfortunately for most of them, it is potential unrealized. For the truth is most business people don't know how to effectively network. They view networking as nothing more than showing up to an event, shaking some hands, handing out business card and waiting for the business to flow. It rarely does.\nNetworking, however, works and can be a fecund source of new business and new opportunities- if one knows how to do it effectively. This book teaches you how to do just that. It covers not just the ABC's of effective networking but the complete alphabet on effective networking.\n\nWhat is networking? How do I get started and where do I go? How do I prepare to network and what tools do I need? How do I start, stop and transition a networking conversation? What are some of the best practices when I'm face to face and when I'm not? How do I follow-up on my networking opportunities? What do I do if I'm uncomfortable about networking? \n\nIn a style that is easy, engaging and economical, it addresses all of these questions and more. In doing so, it provides not just the know-how, but the how-to. You can open this book up to any page and gain value, a rare accomplishment even for a self-help book.\nIf you want to learn how to network, or if you are already networking and want to do it better, pick up this book. You won't be disappointed.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c56dbc465f2e4fcfdb3b79146202d75950eedb9","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Networking+by+John+Chambers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c56dbc465f2e4fcfdb3b79146202d75950eedb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,86,219,196,101,242,228,252,253,179,183,145,70,32,45,117,149,14,237,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
