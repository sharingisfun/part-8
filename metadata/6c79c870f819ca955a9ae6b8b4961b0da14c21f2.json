Milk contains lactose, which is sugar.\n\nNot permitted are starches like pasta, rice, potatoes, bread and sugar. Dr. Jay Wortman believes that it was the introduction of these by Europeans over a hundred and fifty years ago that caused the rise of diabetes and obesity.\n\nAnd so the key to this diet is the avoidance of starch and sugar because those were not common components of a traditional diet.\n\nAn interesting component is oolichan grease. It's a very healthy fat and in the fact it was a big part of the diet in the past, was one of the reasons it was such a healthy diet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c79c870f819ca955a9ae6b8b4961b0da14c21f2","amp;dn":"My+Big+Fat+Diet+%28documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c79c870f819ca955a9ae6b8b4961b0da14c21f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,121,200,112,248,25,202,149,90,154,230,184,180,150,27,13,161,76,33,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
