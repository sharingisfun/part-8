Intrigued by them both,    |\n   | she begins expanding her sexual horizons with her husband Hugo as well as with Henry and  |\n   | others. June shuttles between Paris and New York trying to find acting jobs while Henry   |\n   | works on his first major work, &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; a pseudo-biography of June. Anais and  |\n   | Hugo help finance the book, but June is displeased with Henry's portrayal of her, and     |\n   | Anais and Henry have many arguments about their styles of writing on a backdrop of a      |\n   | Bohemian lifestyle in Paris.                                                              |\n   |___________________________________________________________________________________________|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5688c1985bee241009a9967478022ce5b1913e49","amp;dn":"Henry.and.June.1990.iNTERNAL.BDRip.x264-iNTERNALCOMBUSTiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5688c1985bee241009a9967478022ce5b1913e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,136,193,152,91,238,36,16,9,169,150,116,120,2,44,229,177,145,62,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
