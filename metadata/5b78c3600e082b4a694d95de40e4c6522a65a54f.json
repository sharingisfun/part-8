Backed by a band including longtime cohort Steve Stevens on guitar, the one-time punk pioneer works his way through 15 songs (among which are 8 that didn't make the original cable broadcast, including a superb reading of &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot;) over the course of the 104-minute concert, pausing between tunes to reflect on times that &quot;weren't meant to be remembered,&quot; as Idol puts it. More than half the show is performed semi-acoustically; it's odd to hear the likes of &quot;White Wedding&quot; and &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; played as acoustic duets, but they work. And when Stevens brings out his electric for &quot;Dancing with Myself,&quot; &quot;Mony Mony,&quot; and others, the joint rocks. DVD bonus features include a music-only option for those who want to forgo Billy's rap.\n\nBilly Idol: Vocals, Acoustic guitar\nSteve Stevens: Acoustic &amp; Electric Guitars\nJoseph Simon: Piano, Hammond B3 Organ\nSteve McGrath: Bass, Background Vocals\nMark Shulman: Drums, Background Vocals\nGreg Ellis: Percussion\nStella Soleil : ackground Vocals\n\nRunning time: 104 mins approx\nPAL\nRegion: Any Region\nScreen Ratio: Fullscreen (4:3)\nSubtitles: English; French; Japanese; Portugese; Spanish\nAudio Tracks: Dolby Digital 5.1/Dolby Digital Stereo/DTS 5.1\nLayers: Dual Layer (DVD-9)\n\nTRACKS LISTING:\n\n1 Cradle Of Love\n2 Don't Need A Gun\n3 Flesh For Fantasy\n4 White Wedding\n5 Sweet Sixteen\n6 To Be A Lover\n7 Rebel Yell\n8 Kiss Me Deadly\n9 Eyes Without A Face\n10 Dancing With Myself\n11 Untouchables\n12 Ready Steady Go\n13 Blue Highway\n14 Mony Mony\n15 L.A.
