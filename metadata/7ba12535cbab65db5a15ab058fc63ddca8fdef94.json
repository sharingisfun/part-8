In common with The Beatles, they came from Liverpool and were managed by Brian Epstein. They are most remembered for being the first act to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart with their first three single releases. It was a record that was not equalled for 20 years, until the mid-80s success of fellow Liverpool band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers are the second most successful group from Liverpool to hit the US pop charts behind the Beatles.

It quickly\nbecame the anthem of Liverpool Football Club and is invariably sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game. The words &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; also feature in the club crest and on the Shankly Gate entrance\nto the stadium.
