It was recorded between August 4 and September 1, 1973 and originally released on October 15, 1973. It was the first release under the band's own label, Grateful Dead Records, after fulfilling their contract with Warner Bros. Records. It was their first full-length studio album in nearly three years, since 1970's American Beauty. It was also the first studio album without Ron &quot;Pigpen&quot; McKernan who had died. His absence and new piano player Keith Godchaux's tendency towards jazz (rather than McKernan's tendency towards the blues) changed the band's sound.\n(Wikipedia)\n\n\nTrack listing\n&quot;Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodleloo&quot; (Hunter, Garcia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45 \n&quot;Let Me Sing Your Blues Away&quot; (Hunter, Godchaux) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17 \n&quot;Row Jimmy&quot; (Hunter, Garcia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:14 \n&quot;Stella Blue&quot; (Hunter, Garcia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26 \n&quot;Here Comes Sunshine&quot; (Hunter, Garcia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 \n&quot;Eyes of the World&quot; (Hunter, Garcia) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19 \n&quot;Weather Report Suite&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:53 \n&quot;Prelude&quot; (Weir) \n&quot;Part I&quot; (Weir, Anderson) \n&quot;Part II (Let It Grow)&quot; (Barlow, Weir) \n\nBonus tracks on 2004 reissue\n&quot;Eyes of the World&quot; (live) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 17:05 \n&quot;Weather Report Suite&quot; (acoustic demo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:39 \n&quot;China Doll&quot; (outtake) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:419773603fa929ef51ca0188fca3a3fab0bdfcea","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Wake+of+the+flood++%282004+reissue%29++MP3%40320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"419773603fa929ef51ca0188fca3a3fab0bdfcea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,151,115,96,63,169,41,239,81,202,1,136,252,163,163,250,176,189,252,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
