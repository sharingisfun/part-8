Leonowens (Irene Dunne) and her son travel to the tiny kingdom of Siam, where she has been hired to teach Western ways and culture to the multitudes of children sired by the King (Rex Harrison). All too soon, however, the King and Anna clash over the differences in their ways and cultures; Anna is also drawn into a palace romance between the concubine, Tuptim (Linda Darnell), and another man, which ends in tragedy. Whereas The King And I focused on the budding relationship between Anna and the King, the non-musical version is a more straightforward reading of Margaret Landon's book about the real Anna Leonowens. Harrison made his screen debut in the role, which became synonymous with Yul Brynner in the 1956 musical version.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038303/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038303/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-38303/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-38303/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:03:02\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x464 1.38:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1423 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 160 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9777cbae7703cd13a3e284e2ef216c6219afab8","amp;dn":"Anna+and+the+King+of+Siam+%281946%29+Irene+Dunne+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9777cbae7703cd13a3e284e2ef216c6219afab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,119,124,186,231,112,60,209,58,62,40,78,46,242,22,198,33,154,250,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
