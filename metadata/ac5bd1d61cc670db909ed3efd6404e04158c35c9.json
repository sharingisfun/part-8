Once gardeners learn how plants are constructed, it is easier to envision how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll grow and flourish. An understanding of the structure behind good, healthy soil gives clues as to how to improve oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own garden tilth. This practical guide helps readers identify what plants need to survive and how these fundamental scientific facts are at the heart of good plant care. A chapter on seeds and germination will encourage gardeners at any level to try their hand at propagation, while discussion of soil, pests, and diseases adds to the skills of all gardeners. The final sections of the book take a closer look at biodiversity, ecology, genetic engineering, and nomenclature. For the enthusiastic beginner or the master gardener, Practical Science for Gardeners unravels the mysterious inner life of plants.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5bd1d61cc670db909ed3efd6404e04158c35c9","amp;dn":"Practical+Science+for+Gardeners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5bd1d61cc670db909ed3efd6404e04158c35c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,91,209,214,28,198,112,219,144,158,211,239,214,64,78,4,21,140,53,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
