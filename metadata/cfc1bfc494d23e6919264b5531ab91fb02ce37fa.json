He gigged up a storm in Covent Garden and Portobello Road, which led to his discovery by manager Phil Pickett. One bassist (Phil &quot;Soul&quot; Sewell), one drummer (Richie Stevens), and many gigs later, Jones found himself with his first album, Blufunk Is a Fact!, in 1992. Several more albums ensued over the next 15 years (African Space Craft, Liquid Sunshine, and Black Orpheus among them), fixing Jones as one of the more prominent blues-rock musicians on the European music scene in the late '90s and early 2000s.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-orpheus-r674737/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/black-orpheus-r674737/review&lt;/a&gt; \n\nRelease:\t2003-04-22\nLabel:\tDelabel\nCountry:\tGB\nType:\tAlbum\nLength:\t54:23\n\nTracklist:\n1.
