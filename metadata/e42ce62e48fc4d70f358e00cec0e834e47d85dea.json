Over the past decade, since the publication of the first edition, there have been significant developments by academic research groups and in the film and games industries leading to the development of morphable face models, performance driven animation, as well as increasingly detailed lip-synchronization and hair modeling techniques. These topics are described in the context of existing facial animation principles.\n\nThe second edition provides an up-to-date source for professionals and academic researchers working in the field of facial animation. \n\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1568814488\nISBN-13: 978-1568814483\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\nProfessionals and students alike receive in-depth surveys of the latest advancements in the field of facial animation in a top pick.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€California Bookwatch, March 2009\n\nPraise for the First Edition:\nThis book is the most comprehensive one available on facial animation. The problems raised by this complex task are outlined, and the visualization techniques that can be used are analyzed.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Computing Reviews\n\nThis technical title is a 'must' acquisition for any art school which includes computer-based animation courses: it provides a comprehensive review of the many techniques used in modern computer animation processes, surveys face creation and manipulation processes, and includes plenty of facial animation history and tips. The blend of historical background with practical tips makes for an important title.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Midwest Book Review\n\n\nAbout the Author\nFrederic I. Parke has been active in the development of facial animation since 1971. He joined the faculty of Texas A&amp;M University in 1997 as professor in the College of Architecture and director of the Visualization Laboratory, and he currently coordinates the graduate program in Visualization Sciences. Dr. Parke is the author of a number of technical papers on facial animation and has lectured widely on the subject. He organized and chaired the SIGGRAPH Introduction to Computer Animation tutorials in 1983, 1984, and 1985. In 1989 and 1990 he organized and chaired the SIGGRAPH tutorials on the State of the Art in Facial Animation.\n\nKeith Waters received his PhD in 1988 from Middlesex University, London. Prior to joining France Telecom as director of research, he was the Senior Technology Officer of LifeF/X, developing commercial real-time facial animation. From 1989 to 2000 Dr. Waters was a senior member of the research staff at the Cambridge Research Lab (CRL) formerly Digital Equipment and later Compaq where he worked on the commercialization of DECface and then FaceWorks. While at CRL, he published many pioneering papers on facial animation, particularly on muscle and skin dynamics for face animation, as well as real-time visual text-to-speech. In 1989 and 1990 he was a principal contributor to the SIGGRAPH tutorials on the State of the Art in Facial Animation.
