Despite its short run time, the show received a cult-like fan following. The show was created by Jose Rivera and Karl Schaefer, with Joe Dante serving as creative consultant (and directing a plurality of the episodes).\n\nThe show revolves around Marshall Teller, a young boy whose family moves to the desolate town of Eerie, Indiana, population of 16,661. While moving into his new home, he meets Simon Holmes, one of the few normal people in Eerie. Together, they are faced with bizarre scenarios, which include discovering a sinister group of intelligent dogs that are planning on taking over the world, and meeting a tornado hunter who is reminiscent of Captain Ahab. They also confront numerous urban legends such as Bigfoot and an undead Elvis Presley. Although the show was host to a plethora of jokes, it also featured a serious X-Files-like tone. After thirteen episodes, the last of which did not air during the network run, the series was retooled with Jason Marsden's &quot;Dash-X&quot; added to the cast, and Archie Hahn's Mr. Radford revealed to be an imposter, with John Astin revealed to be the &quot;actual&quot; Mr. Radford. The final episode was a tongue-in-cheek, fourth wall breaking sequence of events depicting Dash-X's attempts to take over as star of the show.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNecrocytosis:\n\nI found this gem of a torrent on some other site and decided to share it on TPB since this show is made of awesome. I loved it when I was a kid and it's still a laugh now. Some of the episodes are mislabeled (the episode numbers are wonky on a few episodes past episode 12. For instance, episode 13 is the show finale and should be episode 19. If you are watching them in order please take note of this and rename the files. I couldn't screw around with the files or all the seeds and peers from the other tracker wouldn't show up and you'd have a pain in the ass downloading it early on. A correct episode list can be found on the show's Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eerie_indiana\n\nEnjoy an early '90s classic.\n\nP.S. Leave comments about how much I rock. ('cause I seriously rock. I'm awesome)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c59774d57b48a27746f2db5343d12229ae1fa5f","amp;dn":"Eerie+Indiana+%28Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c59774d57b48a27746f2db5343d12229ae1fa5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,89,119,77,87,180,138,39,116,111,45,181,52,61,18,34,154,225,250,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
