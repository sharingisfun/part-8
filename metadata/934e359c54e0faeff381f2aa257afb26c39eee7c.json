Her success grew with 1994's Living Under June, which featured her biggest hit to date outside of Canada, &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which was released as a single from the soundtrack to the Christian Slater film Bed of Roses (number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100). Another single from that same album, &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot;, has also had significant, and consistent airplay on Canadian adult contemporary radio since its release, and featured a dance remix version which circulated on pop radio at the time.[1]\n\nSubsequent albums include 1997's Happy?, 2000's Blood Red Cherry, and 2003's Love Is the Only Soldier. She also released a greatest hits album, Greatest Hurts, in 2001, and a live album, Jann Arden Live with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (2002). In 2005, she released her eighth album (her sixth album of new material) titled simply Jann Arden.\n\nIn 1998, respondents to Chart magazine's year-end reader's poll named Arden the Canadian celebrity most deserving of her own talk show. As part of her public honesty about her family life, she has revealed that one of her brothers is serving a life sentence in prison, and that her song &quot;Hangin' by a Thread&quot; is dedicated to him. Arden released her ninth album, Uncover Me, on February 6, 2007. This album was her first comprising cover songs exclusively, except for one original piece, &quot;Counterfeit Heart&quot;. This was followed by her Uncover Me Tour across Canada during the spring of 2007.[2]\n\nOn the weekend of March 24, 2007, Arden was admitted to intensive care for heart related concerns, diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with acute stress and exhaustion.\n\nShe had a 2007 USA summer tour with Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. In 2010, they also carried the Olympic torch.[3]\n\nIn September 2009, Arden released her tenth album, Free, and its first single, A Million Miles Away, in June. She is also doing a cross-country Canadian tour, which began in November 2009. She toured with proceeds going to the &quot;Raise-a-Reader Concert Series&quot;.[4]\n\nIn November 2010, Arden released her first ever live CD and DVD set, entitled Spotlight. Her latest autobiography, Falling Backwards, was released on November 1, 2011, along with a second album of cover songs, Uncover Me 2. \n\n\nTime For Mercy 1993 \n\n\nTime for Mercy is the debut album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released in 1993. The first single was &quot;I Would Die For You&quot;, which received national radio and video airplay. Its video, directed by Jeth Weinrich, won the Juno Award for Video of the Year at the 1994 Juno Awards.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;I Would Die for You&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n2.\t&quot;Waiting for Someone&quot; (Arden, Broom) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n3.\t&quot;Will You Remember Me&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n4.\t&quot;We Do Some Strange Things&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n5.\t&quot;I'm Not Your Lover&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n6.\t&quot;Give Me Back My Heart&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n7.\t&quot;The Way Things Are Going&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n8.\t&quot;Kitchen Window&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n9.\t&quot;I Just Don't Love You Anymore&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n10.\t&quot;Time for Mercy&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n11.\t&quot;Over You&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving Under June 1994\n\n\nLiving Under June is the second album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released in August 1994 (see 1994 in music). Outside of Canada, the album was released in the spring of 1995.\n\n&quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Insensitive&quot; and &quot;Good Mother&quot; were all significant hits for Arden in Canada, with &quot;Wonderdrug,&quot; &quot;Unloved&quot; and &quot;Looking for It&quot; also becoming Canadian adult-contemporary hits. &quot;Insensitive&quot; was Arden's biggest hit internationally, entering the Top 40 in several countries, including Italy and the United States (#12 on the Billboard Hot 100). In the U.S., &quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot; was also a minor Adult Contemporary chart hit (#33). Total worldwide sales for this album come to 1.3 million, with 600,000 Canadian, and 500,000 US. Jackson Browne appears as a guest vocalist on &quot;Unloved&quot;.\n\nThe video for &quot;Good Mother&quot;, directed by Jeth Weinrich, won the Juno Award for Video of the Year at the 1996 Juno Awards. Weinrich also directed the video for &quot;Insensitive&quot;, which was a nominee for the same award, but did not win, at the 1995 Juno Awards.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Could I Be Your Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n2.\t&quot;Demolition Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n3.\t&quot;Looking For It (Finding Heaven)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n4.\t&quot;Insensitive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n5.\t&quot;Gasoline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n6.\t&quot;Wonderdrug&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n7.\t&quot;Living Under June&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n8.\t&quot;Unloved&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n9.\t&quot;Good Mother&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n10.\t&quot;It Looks Like Rain&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy?\n\n\nHappy? is the third album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released in 1997 (see 1997 in music).\n The album's title and cover, which features an image of Arden sucking her thumb, are seemingly at odds with Arden's image as a writer and performer of sad love-gone-wrong songs. However, Arden is also widely known in Canada for being gregariously funny and engaging in concert, and her self-deprecating wit has endeared her to fans. In addition to her own compositions, the album also contained a cover of the 1960s classic &quot;To Sir With Love&quot;. The album title's use of the word &quot;happy&quot; ending in a question mark was first employed a decade earlier by Public Image Limited.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;The Sound Of&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n2.\t&quot;Leave Me Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n3.\t&quot;I Know You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n4.\t&quot;Holy Moses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:54\n5.\t&quot;Wishing That&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n6.\t&quot;Saved&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n7.\t&quot;Ode to a Friend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n8.\t&quot;Shooting Horses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n9.\t&quot;Weeds&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;Hangin' by a Thread&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n11.\t&quot;To Sir With Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood Red Cherry 2000\n\n\nBlood Red Cherry is an album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released in 2000.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Waiting in Canada&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n2.\t&quot;Cherry Popsicle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n3.\t&quot;Sleepless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n4.\t&quot;Never Give Up on Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n5.\t&quot;Mend&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n6.\t&quot;I Only Wanted Sex&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n7.\t&quot;Taste of This&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n8.\t&quot;Into the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n9.\t&quot;In Your Keeping&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n10.\t&quot;Best Dress&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:39\n11.\t&quot;Another Human Being&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:40\n12.\t&quot;Sorry for Myself?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n13.\t&quot;Janeen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n14.\t&quot;Piece of It All&quot; (Broom) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Is The Only Soldier 2001\n\n\nLove Is the Only Soldier is an album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released on September 9, 2003.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;If You Loved Me&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n2.\t&quot;Not Saying Goodbye&quot; (Broom, Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n3.\t&quot;Love Is the Only Soldier&quot; (Broom, Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n4.\t&quot;Anna Rebecca&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n5.\t&quot;Four Feet Deep&quot; (Gryner, Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n6.\t&quot;Only One&quot; (Broom, Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n7.\t&quot;When You Left Me&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n8.\t&quot;Ruby Red&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n9.\t&quot;The Right Road Home&quot; (Bentley, Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n10.\t&quot;Fighting for the World&quot; (Arden) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJann Arden 2005\n\n\nJann Arden is the eighth album from Canadian singer Jann Arden, released in 2005.
