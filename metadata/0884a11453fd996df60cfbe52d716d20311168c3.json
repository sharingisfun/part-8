We are going to model a pirate ship that can be used in game cinematics or film. During this course, we will explore various methods of modeling using vast variety of tools and techniques available in Maya. We will focus on speed and learn how to maintain accuracy of the model. We will touch briefly on ZBrush to help develop organic decorative shapes. We will use multiple ship references and will combine the most interesting elements of design together in order to produce a unique version of a ship. By the end of this training kit, you will have a trained eye to help you identify shortcuts during the modeling process as well as learn several techniques and troubleshooting scenarios, which combined, will allow you to become much more efficient 3D artist.\n\nGuest Tutor\nStanislav Poritskiy\nfrom the Creative Development series\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0884a11453fd996df60cfbe52d716d20311168c3","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Modeling+a+Detailed+Ship+in+Maya+-+sum1_here+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0884a11453fd996df60cfbe52d716d20311168c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,132,161,20,83,253,153,109,246,12,251,229,45,113,109,32,49,17,104,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
