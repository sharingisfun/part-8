Naked is a 2003 album by English rock group The Beatles. It is a remixed and remastered version of their 1970 album Let It Be. The project was overseen by Paul McCartney, who felt that Phil Spector's production did not accurately represent the group's &quot;stripped-down&quot; intentions for the original album. Let It Be... Naked presents the songs &quot;naked&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€without Spector's overdubs and without the incidental studio chatter featured between most cuts of the original album. Let It Be... Naked also replaces &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; with &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, originally featured as the B-side of the &quot;Get Back&quot; single.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Get Back\n[02] Dig A Pony\n[03] For You Blue\n[04] The Long And Winding Road\n[05] Two Of Us\n[06] I've Got A Feeling\n[07] One After 909\n[08] Don't Let Me Down\n[09] I Me Mine\n[10] Across The Universe\n[11] Let It Be\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:34m:59s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Fly On The Wall\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:21m:56s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............ 00h:56m:55s\nTotal File Size....................... 294mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\n-Writing application..............
