In this period he deserved the title &quot;King of the Accordeon&quot;. Although he was mainly known as a player of popular folkmusic, he also was accomplished as a swingjazz and gypsyjazz virtuoso on his instrument. He never really gained momentum outside the Netherlands due to the fact that later in life he was very reluctant to leave his beloved Ansterdam and play abroad. Being a rather stiff drinker didn't help his career much as well, for obvious reasons.\n\nThere aren't to many CD's with his music but on this one, full of swingjazz, he is accompanied by the famous Dutch Swing College Band.\n\nCheck it out and you will hear the music your grandparents danced to!\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
