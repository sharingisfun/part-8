Speculation aside, this is a remarkably gorgeous, exquisitely paced recording.\nThroughout, Getz and Barron exhibit both a deep understanding of the material as well as sympathetic, truly harmonious playing. Never rushed, never brash, People Time lingers over melodies, fleshing them out and extracting every ounce of feeling. \nA must-have.\n\nStan Getz and Kenny Barron\nPeople Time 1992\n\nCD / 320Kbps\n\nPeople Time - CD 1:\n01.
