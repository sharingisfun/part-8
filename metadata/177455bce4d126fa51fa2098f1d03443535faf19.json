The title appears to be taken from Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast, his novel of poverty in 1920s Paris: &quot;I had already seen the end of fall come through boyhood, youth and young manhood, and in one place you could write about it better than in another.&quot;\nThe album was generally well received, but polarized listeners and critics alike: Many music fans appreciated the band's punk and garage rock-influenced revival of the southern rock genre with NME hailing the album among the &quot;best debuts of the last 10 years.&quot;\n&quot;Molly's Chambers&quot;, &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;California Waiting&quot; were all released as singles.&quot;Spiral Staircase&quot; featured on the PS3 game Motorstorm. &quot;Red Morning Light&quot; was also featured on a Ford Focus commercial, and as the opening song in FIFA 2004 by EA Sports.\nThe album was recorded between Sound City Studios, California (where Nirvana's Nevermind and Fleetwood Mac's Rumours were made) and Shangri-La Studio in Malibu.\nThe band's popularity exploded in Australia during the weeks of the 22nd and 29th of September, 2008, when they had all 4 of their studio albums in the top 50, with Youth and Young Manhood making its first top 50 chart appearance since its release in 2003, peaking at number 46. The album sold more than 240,000 copies worldwide.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Red Morning Light\n[02] Happy Alone\n[03] Wasted Time\n[04] Joe's Head\n[05] Trani\n[06] California Waiting\n[07] Spiral Staircase\n[08] Molly's Chambers\n[09] Genius\n[10] Dusty\n[11] Holy Roller Novocaine\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:46m:01s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 109mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 07 July 2003 [UK] 19 August 2003 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Handmedown Records \n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.kingsofleon.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n                            - http://www.muzu.tv/kingsofleon  \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:177455bce4d126fa51fa2098f1d03443535faf19","amp;dn":"%5B2003%5D+Youth+%26+Young+Manhood+-+Kings+Of+Leon+-+109mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"177455bce4d126fa51fa2098f1d03443535faf19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,116,85,188,228,209,38,250,81,250,32,152,241,208,52,67,83,95,175,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
