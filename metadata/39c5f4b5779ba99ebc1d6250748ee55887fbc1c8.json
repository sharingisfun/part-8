Moore shared the stage with such blues and rock musicians as B.B. King,\nAlbert King and George Harrison, and Greg Lake, as well as having a successful solo career.\nHe guested on a number of albums recorded by high profile musicians,\n\n\n\nDuring the early '80s, Moore united with former ELP guitarist/bassist/singer Greg Lake,\nappearing on a pair of Lake solo releases (1981's self-titled release and 1983's Manoeuvres),\nin addition to guesting on another Cozy Powell solo release, Octopuss. But it was also during\nthe '80s that Moore finally got serious with his solo career -- issuing such heavy metal-based\nworks as 1982's Corridors of Power, 1983's Victims of the Future, 1984's Dirty Fingers and the\nin-concert set We Want Moore!, 1985's Run for Cover, 1987's Wild Frontier, plus 1989's\nAfter the War -- establishing a large following in Europe, despite remaining virtually unknown stateside.\n\nThe decade wasn't all rosy for Moore, however -- although he was able to patch up his friendship with\nPhil Lynott (appearing with Lizzy for several tracks on Life/Live, and teaming with Lynott for a\npair of tracks in 1985, &quot;Military Man&quot; and &quot;Out in the Fields,&quot; the latter a U.K. hit),\nyears of hard living finally caught up with Lynott, leading to his passing in January of 1986.\nMoore would subsequently dedicate &quot;Wild Frontier&quot; to Lynott, and honored Thin Lizzy's\nformer frontman on the track &quot;Blood of Emeralds&quot; (from After the War).\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n01.
