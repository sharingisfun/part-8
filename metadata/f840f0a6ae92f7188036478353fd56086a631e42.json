No design is too ambitious, and no obstacle too large in their quest for the perfect house.\r\nFollowing the internationally successful Grand Designs format, the series will see the process of these incredible design projects, as well as the personal journeys of those building them - from the initial blueprints, through to the long and often arduous task of turning the plans into practical living spaces.\r\nUsing archaic or new-school building techniques and material, and locations from the beach, to the mountains, and the hills in between, Grand Designs New Zealand will feature houses ranging from architectural designer mansions to DIY homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Concrete Farmhouse \r\nDeer farmer and bachelor Lachlan McDonald is building a three-bedroom concrete home in the hopes to fill it with a family in the future. However, the choice of location is one of the most remote and stormy parts of the country - The Catlins. He's hired a top Auckland architect who is scratching his head at Lachlan's decision to project manage his first build himself. His choice of builder is also a good mate who specialises in constructing local milking sheds. Will this Grand Design be a perfect fusion of passions and experience or are these personalities destined to clash?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/79/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Grand-Designs-New-Zealand-Season-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3164 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 8\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,017 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv3.co.nz/Shows/GrandDesignsNZ.aspx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f840f0a6ae92f7188036478353fd56086a631e42","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+New+Zealand+Series+1+1of8+Concrete+Farmhouse+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f840f0a6ae92f7188036478353fd56086a631e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,64,240,166,174,146,247,24,128,54,71,131,83,253,86,8,106,99,30,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
