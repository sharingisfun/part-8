The band achieved notable success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, five reaching #2 and one, Block Buster, reaching #1.\nSweet membership has undergone a number of changes, and during different periods Scott, Connolly and Priest also each formed their own &quot;Sweet&quot;, resulting in the separate bands Andy Scott's Sweet, Brian Connolly's Sweet and Steve Priest's Sweet.\nConnolly died in 1997, and Tucker in 2002.\nTwo &quot;Sweet&quot; bands, Sweet and Steve Priest's Sweet, are still in existence, the former including Scott.\n\n\nTack fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r att ni hjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤lper till att seeda\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f73cb3fdaffe6439f46799313d6adeed897760e","amp;dn":"The+Sweet-1971-1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f73cb3fdaffe6439f46799313d6adeed897760e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,115,203,63,218,255,230,67,159,70,121,147,19,214,173,238,216,151,118,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
