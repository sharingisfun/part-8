With the home cooks requiring a 'yes' from each judge to receive an apron this season, it's harder than ever for finalists to make it into the coveted Top 14. Those who get a 'no' from each judge will be sent home, while those who earn at least one 'yes' will have a second chance, and the opportunity to cook again for a White Apron and a place in the coveted Top 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 14-Feb-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f412f9c6b92376807b08ebab0596b6bf3e15859a","amp;dn":"MasterChef+Canada+S03E01+HDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f412f9c6b92376807b08ebab0596b6bf3e15859a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,18,249,198,185,35,118,128,123,8,235,171,5,150,182,191,62,21,133,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
