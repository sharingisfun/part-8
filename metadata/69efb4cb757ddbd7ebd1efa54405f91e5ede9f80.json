It cuts through seven national\n              Parks and 24 national forests as it travels through\n              California, Oregon and Washington. Its a trail of\n              ever-changing obstacles - from some of the highest\n              mountain passes in the west to the hottest desert in\n              the country. The two to three hundred hikers who\n              attempt the PCT each year often find out quickly if\n              they have what it takes for the journey ahead.

Because there is so little film \n              I decided to just leave it alone and not blend it up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69efb4cb757ddbd7ebd1efa54405f91e5ede9f80","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Americas.Wild.Spaces.S04E01.Pacific.Crest.Tr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69efb4cb757ddbd7ebd1efa54405f91e5ede9f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,239,180,203,117,125,219,215,235,209,239,165,68,5,249,30,94,222,159,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
