But so does the Headless Horseman, whose head Ichabod chopped off before his perceived death. The horseman begins his nightly killing spree, and Ichabod must partner with Lt. Abbie Mills.\nAbbie investigates the horseman after he kills the sheriff (Clancy Brown). While hunting the horseman, Abbie looks into the old case files her old partner (the former sheriff) was investigating and learns of two types of occult groupsÃ¢â‚¬â€one for good, the other evilÃ¢â‚¬â€which may have summoned the horseman again. If the horseman is not stopped, dark supernatural forces will affect the Earth. This becomes more difficult as the Horseman discovers modern weaponry, which he assimilates into his ritualistic hunt. Ichabod must also adjust to the societal and technological differences of the 21st century.\nThe headless horseman is revealed to be Death, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse described in the Book of Revelation.\nAs Abbie is a black woman, Crane's worldview from 18th century Colonial America may cause some friction with her, and also the people he must now work with. Given the fact that he is, and states he is from, the time of the American Revolution, local law enforcement see him as a madman but useful in hunting the horseman.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176d4bcf5fb34de28eac2b8538198a691f4a5945","amp;dn":"Sleepy.Hollow.S01E04.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176d4bcf5fb34de28eac2b8538198a691f4a5945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,109,75,207,95,179,77,226,142,172,43,133,56,25,138,105,31,74,89,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
