Think classic \nCosby records (the &quot;like I said, I grew up with...&quot; transitions are pure \nWonderfulness) crossed with a comedian for the post-everything generation \n(there's a bear eating Kanye West at Bonnaroo bit that'll either make you feel \nawesome or old) and you're in the general neighborhood of Weirdo, plus you \ncan add some unexpected wisdom as Glover realizes the approach of his \nthirties means he'll be entering the &quot;locked-in&quot; era, when teens-and-twenties \nfolly gives way to life-defining adulthood (which, according to &quot;Weird Is \nGood,&quot; is also the time to start questioning Muppet Babies). Glover is on a \ngreat, relatable run from &quot;S'Mores&quot; to &quot;Home Depot&quot; (&quot;Auschwitz for kids&quot;), \nbut the killer bit toward the end of the album involves a turd, and it isn't even contained within the track dubbed &quot;Poop.&quot; With plenty of turd, sex, and &quot;Tiny Hitlers&quot; talk, sitcom fans, and even Glover's hip-hop fans, should be aware that Weirdo does earn its title. Get past that and this is like the Fat Albert kids hanging with Odd Future, creating a great, very funny, Weird Harold-like mix of everyman and edgy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd0becbd3d5581cf8087c2dadf8835d0ca3edb3","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Donald+Glover+-+Weirdo+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd0becbd3d5581cf8087c2dadf8835d0ca3edb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,208,190,203,211,213,88,28,248,8,124,45,173,248,131,93,12,163,237,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
