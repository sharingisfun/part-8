At a time when the cooler sounds of West Coast jazz began to dominate the public face of the music, Brubeck proved there was an audience for the style far beyond the confines of the in-crowd, and with his emphasis on unusual time signatures and adventurous tonalities, Brubeck showed that ambitious and challenging music could still be accessible . . .\n. . . with the popularization of bossa nova in the early '60s, practically every recording artist had to have at least one bossa nova album. This effort by the Dave Brubeck Quartet is better than most due to the high quality of the compositions, of which the title cut is best-known. The date's two standards (&quot;This Can't Be Love&quot; and &quot;Trolley Song&quot;) also fare well on this upbeat session . . .\n\n\nTHE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET\n\nBossa Nova USA     1963\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nTracks 1 to 10    The Original Album\nTracks 11 to 17   Bonus Tracks\n\n\nDave Brubeck Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\nPaul Desmond Ã¢â‚¬â€œ alto saxophone\nEugene Wright Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nJoe Morello Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\n\nRecorded in January, July, October 1962\nReleased 1963\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f0911cbc51a799f754fa559760cedbfbf30fe6","amp;dn":"The+Dave+Brubeck+Quartet+-+Bossa+Nova+USA+1963+%5BBonus+Tracks%5D+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f0911cbc51a799f754fa559760cedbfbf30fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,240,145,28,188,81,167,153,247,84,250,85,151,96,206,219,251,243,15,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
