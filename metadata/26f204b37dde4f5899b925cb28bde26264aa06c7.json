Alonso (ICP, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nAtomic clusters are the bridge between molecules and the bulk matter. Following two key experiments â€” the observation of electronic shells in metallic clusters and the discovery of the C60 fullerence â€” the field of atomic clusters has experienced a rapid growth, and is now considered a mature field. The electrons of the cluster are confined to a small volume, hence, quantum effects are manifested on many properties of the clusters. Another interesting feature is that the properties often change in a non-smooth way as the number of atoms in the cluster increases. This book provides an updated overview of the field, and presents a detailed description of the structure and electronic properties of different types of clusters: Van der Waals clusters, metallic clusters, clusters of ionic materials and network clusters. The assembling of clusters is also considered, since specially stable clusters are expected to play a role in the future design and synthesis of new materials","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26f204b37dde4f5899b925cb28bde26264aa06c7","amp;dn":"Structure+and+Properties+of+Atomic+Nanoclusters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26f204b37dde4f5899b925cb28bde26264aa06c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,242,4,179,125,222,79,88,153,185,37,203,40,189,226,98,100,170,6,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
