(note: you can turn subs on or off)\n\nENCODING SETTINGS:\nCRF 19, Ref=8, bframes=8, me=umh, Subme=10, Me_range=32, Trellis=2, b_pyramid=2, b_adapt=2, direct=3, weightb=1, weightp=2, rc_lookahead=100, mixed_ref=1\n\nPlease seed when you are done so I can move on to seeding the next season. A good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRF encoding maintains a constant quality across episodes by adjusting the required file size (bit-rate) to maintain the desired quality. Some scenes/episodes need a higher bit-rate than others. CRF...file sizes never too little and never too much...constant high quality across the board.\nThe high profile x264 settings provide greater compression, while maintaining the crf-19. i.e. CRF-19 at lower x264 settings would have the same quality, but would result in larger files.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~NO: 350mb no matter what files, x-vid video, mp3 audio.\n~Always: Untouched ac3 audio, full resolution video, high-profile x264 settings, Larger files (only) when needed.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6da6fd1b26337ef1eb0bbe1e6f54ad8d484c74","amp;dn":"The.X-Files.Season.6.x264.dolby.AC3.subs-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6da6fd1b26337ef1eb0bbe1e6f54ad8d484c74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,109,166,253,27,38,51,126,241,235,11,190,30,111,84,173,141,72,76,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
