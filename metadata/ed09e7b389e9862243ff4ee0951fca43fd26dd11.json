They are noted for\ntheir atmospheric sound, featuring grand guitars set to pulsating rhythms. The\nTemper Trap first attracted the attention of the worldwide music industry after\nplaying to sell-out crowds at the Musexpo in London in October 2008, and then\nat South by Southwest in March 2009.\n\nConditions is the debut album by The Temper Trap. The debut album is\nunquestionably set to deliver upon the immense promise created by acclaimed\nsingles Science Of Fear and Sweet Disposition. It is a collection of songs\nequally ambitious as bold and crucially in the modern era, each song demands\nshared billing. From the soaring Down River, resplendent with strings,\nhorns &amp; choirs to the spine-tingling Solder On, the tribal percussive beat of\nlive favourite Drum Song and transcendent Love Lost, which somehow wields the\ncommon ground between neo-soul and wide-screen alternative rock.\n\nTracks\n01 Love Lost\n02 Rest\n03 Sweet Disposition\n04 Down River\n05 Soldier On\n06 Fader\n07 Fools\n08 Resurrection\n09 Science Of Fear\n10 Drum Song\n\nEnjoy The Music And Please Seed As Much As You Can. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed09e7b389e9862243ff4ee0951fca43fd26dd11","amp;dn":"The+Temper+Trap+-+Conditions+%5B2009%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+%5B1337x%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed09e7b389e9862243ff4ee0951fca43fd26dd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,9,231,179,137,233,134,34,67,255,78,224,149,31,202,67,253,38,221,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
