Born in Hungary in 1913, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s wrote and co-authored over 1,500 papers and pioneered several fields in theoretical mathematics. At the age of 83 he still spent most of his time on the road, going from math meeting to math meeting, continually working on problems. He died on September 20, 1996 while attending such a meeting in Warsaw, Poland. N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s was filmed between 1988 and 1991.\n\nThe film opens at Cambridge University's 1991 honorary doctorate ceremony, where ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s received an award he says he would gladly trade for a &quot;nice new proof.&quot; For ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s, the meaning of life is &quot;to prove and conjecture.&quot;\n\nIn an age dominated by technical wizardry and high tech communications, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s was an unusual human link connecting hundreds of people. As he traveled from country to country, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s carried with him the latest in mathematical thinking, inspiring others to develop new ideas and, sometimes, entire new fields. In turn, the mathematical community supported this repository of centuries of mathematical knowledge and lore. Every mathematician in the world has an &quot;ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s Number&quot;-the number of people he or she is removed from having co-authored a paper with ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s.\nTo pursue this life of wandering and pure scholarship, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s relied on a network of other renowned mathematicians-all of whom regarded him as an international treasure. Wherever he touched down, whether in Hungary, Australia or Kalamazoo, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s immediately began working on problems with his colleagues. They, in turn, took care of his everyday needs. Ronald Graham, director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Center at AT&amp;T Laboratories, keeps an &quot;ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s Room&quot; at his home in New Jersey. From here, Graham managed ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s's financial affairs and coordinated his travels and lectures, trying to maintain a semblance of order in the life of a man who kept no bank accounts and gave money to anyone he felt needed it. In Cambridge, England, BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BollobÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, an ex-ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s student, provided another oasis. As the film progresses it becomes clear that mathematicians around the world had more than a professional stake in caring for ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s. In different ways, each of the many prominent mathematicians in the film expresses dedication to and love for ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s.\nThe structure of N is a Number is based on ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s's 50 years of perpetual wandering, &quot;like a bumblebee,&quot; carrying news and mathematical information from university to university. ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s established himself as a serious mathematician at the age of 20 when he devised a more elegant proof for Chebyshev's theorem, i.e., that there is always a prime number between any number and its double. He was at the center of an informal clique of gifted young mathematicians in Hungary, known as the Anonymous Group, because they would meet in a Budapest park under the statue of a medieval historian named Anonymous.\n \n\n\nErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s' genius was for the problem that requires little mathematical experience to state and only ingenuity to solve. He cared little for the applications of his ideas... \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jeremy Gray, The Guardian, September 28, 1996\n\n\nHe never had a &quot;proper&quot; teaching job, but constantly traveled around the world, in search of new challenges. Considering material possessions a nuisance, he lived for over 60 years out of half-full suitcases, which he never learned to pack. His discarded suit was rejected by Oxfam. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BollobÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, The Independent, October 3, 1996\n\n\nHe succumbed to the seduction of every beautiful problem he encountered. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Joel Spencer, Courant Institute, New York University, January 1997\n\n\nA mathemetician of unique style and vision, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s will remain on the short list of those whose work defines the mathematics of our century. ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s' interests covered a multitude of branches of mathematics. Foremost among them are number theory, finite and transfinite combinatorics, classical analysis (especially by the theory of interpolation), and discrete geometry, but his work extends to many other fields, including probability theory, topology, group theory, complex functions, and more. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡szlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ Babai, &quot;Paul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s (1913-1996): His Influence on the Theory of Computing,&quot; Symposium on the Theory of Computing Conference, 1997\n\nHe became the most prolific mathematician of his generation, writing or co-authoring 1,000 papers and still publishing one a week in his seventies. His research spanned many areas, but it was in number theory that he was considered a genius. He set problems that were often easy to state but extremely tricky to solve and which involved the relationships between numbers. He liked to say that if one could think of a problem in mathematics that was unsolved and more than 100 years old, it was probably a problem in number theory. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Times, September 25, 1996\n\n\nPaul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s was well known even outside mathematical circles for his singular dedication to mathematics, which resulted in his living as a &quot;mathematical pilgrim&quot; for much of his life. He was known as a poser and solver of problems, but his problems often seemed to lead to deep theories, which were then explored by others. By his trips and by his collaboration with other mathematicians, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s stimulated an enormous amount of mathematical activity. His contributions to number theory and to combinatorics were immense. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Fernando Q. GouvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©a, Editor, MAA Online, October 5, 1996\n\n\nIf the Martians had made contact with earth during the lifetime of Paul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s he would have made a good choice as this planet's ambassador. The aliens would have appreciated his unearthly intelligence. He spoke the universe's common tongue, the theory of numbers, with fluency and wit. Importantly, Mr. ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s would never have missed the trappings of this world. He had no chldren, no wife, no house, no credit card, no job, no change of shoes, indeed nothing but a suitcase containing a few clothes and some notebooks. Neither was he fussy about food, as long as he had coffee. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Economist, October 5, 1996\n\n\nIn more than six decades of astonishing activity, ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s made fundamental contributions to number theory, probability theory, real and complex analysis, geometry, approximation theory, set theory and, especially, combinatorics. Perhaps his genius shone brightest in number theory and combinatorics. He practically created the areas of probabilistic number theory, partition calculus for infinite cardinals, extremal graph theory and the theory of random graphs...&quot;Another roof, another proof&quot; was his legendary motto, and from his twenties he hardly ever slept in the same bed for seven consecutive nights...But it was as a source of problems that ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s was in a class of his own: in the entire history of mathematics there is nobody remotely like him. He has left behind hundreds of attractive problems that are easy to state but that usually turn out to have pinpointed the heart of the matter...Paul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s lived as he wanted to: he &quot;proved and conjectured&quot; to the great benefit of mathematics. He kept up the flood of exciting results well into his seventies, and remained phenomenally productive until the day he died. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la BollobÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s, Nature, October 17, 1996\n\n\nHe would bring the mathematical news, pose problems, inspire the locals with his brilliant ideas, and depart in a few days, leaving behind his exhausted hosts to work out the details of their joint work. His open mind, his ability to see the unexpected, and his willingness to wrestle with complications without the help of well-established tools made him a welcome guest wherever he went...Perhaps his greatest contribution to mathematics was that he realized and demonstrated (decades before it came to be accepted) the importance of seemingly contradictory properties, such as efficient networks with few connections. These methods are of paramount importance in computer science, though ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s himself never touched a computer. \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Daily Telegraph, October 4, 1996\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76659e2506365ff363ff87253c92ca4705abafe","amp;dn":"Paul+Erdos+-+N+is+a+number+%28Mathematics++Asperger%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76659e2506365ff363ff87253c92ca4705abafe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,102,89,226,80,99,101,255,54,63,248,114,83,201,44,164,112,90,186,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
