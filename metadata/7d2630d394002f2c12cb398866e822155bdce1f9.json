In as harshly realistic a manner as possible in the still censor-dominated Hollywood of 1955, the film recounts Roth's rise to fame, her precipitous fall and her tearful comeback. The fact that Roth loves not wisely but too well is only part of the problem (only two of her eight husbands are portrayed in the film); contributing factors to her self-destruction also included her witchlike &quot;stage mother&quot; (Jo Van Fleet) and the pressures of fame and fortune. The principal reason for Roth's fall from the height of fame to the depths of squalor and despair is booze -- at least until she begins to pull herself together with the help of Alcoholics-Anonymous representative Burt McGuire (Eddie Albert). The story concludes with a testimonial staged in Roth's honor on the TV series This is Your Life (the original of which still exists in kinescope form). Having been personally coached by the real Lillian Roth, Susan Hayward does an excellent job of copying the singer's unique style. Though Hayward did not win an Oscar for her performance, she did cop the &quot;Best Actress&quot; prize at the Cannes Film Festival. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048191/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nBraz.subs:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3538677/i-ll-cry-tomorrow-pb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3538677/i-ll-cry-tomorrow-pb&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\nDaniel Mann\n\n\n\n        Susan Hayward\t ... \tLillian Roth\n\tRichard Conte\t... \tTony Bardeman\n\tEddie Albert\t... \tBurt McGuire\n\tJo Van Fleet\t... \tKatie Roth\n\tDon Taylor\t... \tWallie\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:58:46\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x352\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 756 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 66 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2630d394002f2c12cb398866e822155bdce1f9","amp;dn":"I%5C%27ll+Cry+Tomorrow+%281955%29+Susan+Hayward+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2630d394002f2c12cb398866e822155bdce1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,38,48,211,148,0,47,44,18,203,57,136,102,232,34,21,91,220,225,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
