Series by Marvel (officially, volume 7) and fills a request from KAT. The stories included are:\n\n-What If House of M - What if the Scarlet Witch had said 'No More Powers' instead of 'No More Mutants'?\n-What If Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America - What if Iron Man had been killed instead of Captain America?\n-What If Newer Fantastic Four - What if the New Fantastic Four had battled Thanos?\n-What If Spider-Man: Back in Black - What if Mary Jane had been shot instead of Aunt May?\n-What If Secret Wars - What if Doctor Doom had kept the Beyonder's power?\n\nFour of the books are in nice-looking Minutemen scans; House of M is also a good one, by SEGoat-DCP. Full titles for the scanner groups are in the individual comic names. Thanks to all of them for their efforts; please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907868f6ee141e1206a9e8cffbd630a2e5eb326e","amp;dn":"What+If+v7+01-05+%282009%7CMinutemen%2BDCP%29+%5BREQUESTED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907868f6ee141e1206a9e8cffbd630a2e5eb326e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,120,104,246,238,20,30,18,6,169,232,207,251,214,48,162,229,235,50,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
