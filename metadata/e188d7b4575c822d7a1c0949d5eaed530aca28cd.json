Or that it played a crucial role in the building of the pyramids, the founding of America, the Industrial Revolution and advancements in medicine? That's right - beer. Scientists and historians line up to tell the amazing, untold story that puts beer at the centre of the human civilization. Until almost modern times, it wasn't just a drink-beer was vital to life. Where water contained deadly bacteria, beer was safe, as the fermentation killed the germs. It was drunk by men, women and children for a large period of time, and inspired great moments in human history. Beer was vital to the birth of America from the moment the Mayflower stopped in Plymouth - find out why!\n\n2)  How Stuff Works Beer Connoisseur \nBarley, water, hops and yeast might not sound like a recipe for success, but to the beer connoisseur, the fine balance of those four ingredients is the stuff of legend. If you've ever been to a specialty beer store, the variety can seem infinite, but there are really just two main varieties -- lager and ale. With everyone from home enthusiasts to industry giants continuing to push the limits of flavour development and production technology, beer is more than just a refreshing beverage. It's the world's greatest science project.\n\n3)  Emeril Green What's Brewing \nDid you know that 9 million six-packs of beer are home-brewed annually? With the sales of organic beer doubling in 3 years, beer is not just for drinking anymore. Jason's hobby is brewing beer. He'd love to learn some entertaining recipes that will highlight his home brew. Chef Emeril will start him off with a light and citrusy Asian Style Mussels Meuniere. Sure to be a crowd pleaser, Emeril's Favorite Choucroute Casserole. A Raspberry Wheat Ale is delicious used in a dressing for a Mixed Baby Greens With Goat Cheese Salad. And for dessert, Espresso Amber Ale Ice Cream With Dark Chocolate Honey Sauce.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/424/howbeersavedtheworldscr.jpg&quot;
