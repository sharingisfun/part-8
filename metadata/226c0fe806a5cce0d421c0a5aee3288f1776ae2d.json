Highlonesome of Milwaukee WI, An Americana effort, pooling together multiple Roots Music stylings has recently raised the bar, This release, In life we cant be free, clearly captures the darkness and pain of frontman and songwriter Noah Tyson. The album is soaked in misery, lost love and dealings with death. These boys really have something with this album, its refreshing! In an age where just about about every style of music has been beaten to death, they have given Roots Music Fans a breath of fresh air with this album.\n\n- The most honest and pure group to come around in ages. If Woody Guthrie had more balls and was fueled by piss and vinegar, you would have Highlonesome. Great band, great songs - \n\n.357 String Band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226c0fe806a5cce0d421c0a5aee3288f1776ae2d","amp;dn":"Highlonesome+-+In+Life+We+Cant+Bee+Free+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226c0fe806a5cce0d421c0a5aee3288f1776ae2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,108,15,232,6,165,204,224,212,33,192,165,174,227,40,143,23,118,174,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
