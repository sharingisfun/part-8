The REVERB CLASSICS faithfully recreate two renowned hall reverbs that have shaped the sound of music since the 1980s. Brought to life by Softube, the RC 24 and RC 48 have a lush, harmonic character that gives every mix stunning dimension.\n\nThe interface is ultra-intuitive to use, and a first-of-its kind visual display allows you to see the shape of the reverb for instant adjustments with gorgeous visual feedback. Whether adding depth and texture, or taking sounds out into space for sound design, the REVERB CLASSICS add their famous sonic signature to any production.\n\nBoth effects run as stand-alone plugins in any DAW, and integrate perfectly with MASCHINE.\n\n\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows: Windows 8, Windows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n[Update]\n1.Burn or mount the image.\n2.Install the update.\n3.Enjoy!\n\n[New Install]\n1.Run our NI_InstReg tool.\n2.Burn or mount the image.\n3.Install.\n4.Enjoy!\n\n\nCode\nAAX Plugin is patched : You need cracked AAX Host to use.\nThis release is update and requires previous versions installed.\nHowever, we included the tool to install the update without that.\nCheck R2R.txt for further information.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
