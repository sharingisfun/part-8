The madman who has them at gunpoint has a simple plan: one hostage an hour will die unless the demands are met. Called to the scene is Arthur Potter, the FBI's best hostage negotiator. He has a plan. But so does one of the hostages-a beautiful teacher who's willing to do anything to save the lives of her students. Now, the clock is ticking as a chilling game of cat and mouse begins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c34816d67f0d67818dae21cbf8acb31b7442d3b","amp;dn":"A+Maiden%27s+Grave+by+Jeffery+Deaver+%28Retail%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c34816d67f0d67818dae21cbf8acb31b7442d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,52,129,109,103,240,214,120,24,218,226,28,191,138,203,49,183,68,45,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
