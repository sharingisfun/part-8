A century ago, they were referred to as &quot;colonials&quot;. During the 1960s, they were known as &quot;immigrants&quot;. Today, they are &quot;citizens&quot;. But how have the challenges facing each generation of immigrants changed?\n\n\n1)  Colonials \nMany Muslims would die for France during the First and Second World Wars, but did France recognise their sacrifices?\n\n2)  Immigrants \nHow a generation of Muslims abandoned their parents' dreams of returning home and began building their lives in France.\n\n3)  Citizens \nWhat challenges face the young Muslims who grew up in France at a time of economic crisis?\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;034e626a6d434f302d32&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20.5 (~1260Kbps)\n * Video Resolution: 832x432\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.93:1\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.42 VBR 48KHz (~132Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 47 mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 447 MB (average)\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: JungleBoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b09a01969b3020229623635c0439310ccfde5c","amp;dn":"Al-Jazeera+Muslims+of+France+3of3+Citizens+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b09a01969b3020229623635c0439310ccfde5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,176,154,1,150,155,48,32,34,150,35,99,92,4,57,49,12,207,222,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
