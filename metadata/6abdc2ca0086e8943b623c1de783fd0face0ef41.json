In Me, Myself, and Why, Jennifer Ouellette dives into the miniscule ranges of variation to understand just what sets us apart. She draws on cutting-edge research in genetics, neuroscience, and psychologyÃ¢â‚¬â€enlivened as always with her signature sense of humorÃ¢â‚¬â€to explore the mysteries of human identity and behavior. Readers follow her own surprising journey of self-discovery as she has her genome sequenced, her brain mapped, her personality typed, and even samples a popular hallucinogen. Bringing together everything from Mendel's famous pea plant experiments and mutations in The X-Men to our taste for cilantro and our relationships with virtual avatars, Ouellette takes us on an endlessly thrilling and illuminating trip into the science of ourselves.\n\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abdc2ca0086e8943b623c1de783fd0face0ef41","amp;dn":"Me%2C+Myself%2C+and+Why%3A+Searching+for+the+Science+of+Self+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abdc2ca0086e8943b623c1de783fd0face0ef41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,189,194,202,0,134,232,148,59,98,60,29,231,131,253,15,172,224,239,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
