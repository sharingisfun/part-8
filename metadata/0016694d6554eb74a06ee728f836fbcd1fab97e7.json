In How to Create a Mind, Kurzweil presents a provocative exploration of the most important project in human-machine civilizationÃ¢â‚¬â€reverse engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works and using that knowledge to create even more intelligent machines.\n\nKurzweil discusses how the brain functions, how the mind emerges from the brain, and the implications of vastly increasing the powers of our intelligence in addressing the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems. He thoughtfully examines emotional and moral intelligence and the origins of consciousness and envisions the radical possibilities of our merging with the intelligent technology we are creating.\n\nCertain to be one of the most widely discussed and debated science books of the year, How to Create a Mind is sure to take its place alongside KurzweilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous classics which include Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and The Age of Spiritual Machines.\n\n\n\nReviews:\n\nIt is rare to find a book that offers unique and inspiring content on every page. How to Create a Mind achieves that and more. Ray has a way of tackling seemingly overwhelming challenges with an army of reason, in the end convincing the reader that it is within our reach to create nonbiological intelligence that will soar past our own. This is a visionary work that is also accessible and entertaining.\n--Rafael Reif, president, MIT\n \nKurzweil's new book on the mind is magnificent, timely, and solidly argued! His best so far!\n--Marvin Minsky, MIT Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences; cofounder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab; widely regarded as the father of artificial intelligence\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nRay Kurzweil is the author of The New York Times bestseller The Singularity Is Near and the national bestseller The Age of Spiritual Machines, among others.
