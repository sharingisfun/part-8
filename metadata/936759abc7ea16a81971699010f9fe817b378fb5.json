The answer to this question becomes clear in this romp through the &quot;seemingly useless&quot; world of pure science, where one thing leads to another in ways that result in major scientific advancements.\n\n With a novelistic style, C. RenÃƒÂ©e James reveals how obscure studies of natural phenomenaÃ¢â‚¬â€including curved space-time, poisonous cone snails, exploding black holes, and the precise chemical makeup of the sunÃ¢â‚¬â€led unexpectedly to WiFi, GPS, genetic sequencing, pain medications, and cancer treatments. Science Unshackled brings both science and scientists to life and shows how simple curiosity can result in life-changing breakthroughs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936759abc7ea16a81971699010f9fe817b378fb5","amp;dn":"Science+Unshackled+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936759abc7ea16a81971699010f9fe817b378fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,103,89,171,199,234,22,168,25,113,105,144,16,249,254,129,123,55,143,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
