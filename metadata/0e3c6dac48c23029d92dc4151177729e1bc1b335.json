They are best known for their hit song &quot;Flirtin' with Disaster&quot; from the album of the same title. The band, founded by Dave Hlubek and Steve Holland, took its name from a prostitute who allegedly mutilated and decapitated her clients. Most of Molly Hatchet album covers feature heroic fantasy inspired art, some of which were painted by artists Frank Frazetta, Boris Vallejo and Paul R. Gregory.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLightning Strikes Twice is the seventh studio album by American southern rock band Molly Hatchet, released in 1989.
