A candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968, he was described by Milan Kundera as &quot;one of the great novelists of our century&quot; and by John Updike as &quot;one of the profoundest of the late moderns.&quot;Gombrowicz's works were considered scandalous and subversive by the ruling powers in Poland and were banned for nearly forty years. He spent his last years in France teaching philosophy; this book is a series of reflections based on his lectures.Gombrowicz discusses Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Heidegger in six &quot;one-hour&quot; essays and addresses Marxism in a shorter &quot;fifteen-minute&quot; piece. The text--a small literary gem full of sardonic wit, brilliant insights, and provocative criticism--constructs the philosophical lineage of his work.\nGenre: Non Fiction , Educational","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97786beaa532269def9bc6ec0a6cea0ab3e9ddda","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+Philosophy+in+Six+Hours+and+Fifteen+Minutes+by+Witold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97786beaa532269def9bc6ec0a6cea0ab3e9ddda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,120,107,234,165,50,38,157,239,155,198,236,10,108,234,10,179,233,221,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
