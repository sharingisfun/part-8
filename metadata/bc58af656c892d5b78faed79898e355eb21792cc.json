The piano and strings that make up the opening &quot;A Snowflake&quot; set the tone of Float, which could almost be an understated soundtrack to a moody documentary, the soft echo of notes mixing with a room sound where disconnected noises and echoes function almost on the level of the similar sounds Martin Hannett gave Joy Division on Unknown Pleasures -- less dramatic perhaps, but still designed to leave the listener wondering a bit about what exactly is being heard. Piano is Broderick's primary instrument throughout, and if his compositions are working in a familiar vein -- more Harold Budd than Glenn Gould, say -- then it's all still very well done, with the flowing lyricism of a song like &quot;Stopping on the Broadway Bridge&quot; (the longest song on the album and the most accomplished in its feeling of living up to the title), making for a highlight. Calm instances of vocalizations, as on &quot;A Glacier&quot; and &quot;Another Glacier&quot; add a further layer of almost-clear interpretation that beguiles the listener without fully resolving into clear meaning. \n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed \n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/31/peter-broderick/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc58af656c892d5b78faed79898e355eb21792cc","amp;dn":"Peter+Broderick...Float%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc58af656c892d5b78faed79898e355eb21792cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,88,175,101,108,137,45,91,120,250,237,121,137,142,53,94,178,23,146,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
