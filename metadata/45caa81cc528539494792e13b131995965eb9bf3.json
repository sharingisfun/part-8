However, Bunyan found the experience frustrating, and decided to head for the Scottish islands in search of an artistic commune supposedly established by Donovan. She travelled around the countryside with her partner Robert in a horse-drawn wagon. It was during these travels that she wrote the songs which would later appear on Just Another Diamond Day.\n\nBunyan returned to London where she was urged by producer Joe Boyd to record her songs while they were still fresh. The recording session took place in December 1969 at Sound Techniques in London. Song arrangements were performed by Robert Kirby, who also worked with Nick Drake. Simon Nicol and Dave Swarbrick of Fairport Convention and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band contributed to some tracks. The album was initially released in 1970 but was a commercial failure and Bunyan retired from music for many years.\n\nJust Another Diamond Day was re-released by Spinney Records in 2000, its success prompting Bunyan to return to music and eventually record the much delayed follow-up Lookaftering, released in 2005. Just Another Diamond Day was also featured in a UK TV advert for T-Mobile's Flext in 2006.\n\nAll songs written by Vashti Bunyan, except where noted.\n\n&quot;Diamond Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45caa81cc528539494792e13b131995965eb9bf3","amp;dn":"Vashti+Bunyan...Just+Another+Diamond+Day%281970%29remastered%282000%29%5BF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45caa81cc528539494792e13b131995965eb9bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,202,168,28,197,40,83,148,148,121,46,19,177,49,153,89,101,235,155,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
