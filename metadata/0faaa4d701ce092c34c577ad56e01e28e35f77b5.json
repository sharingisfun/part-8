Mauritanian vocalist Daby Toure (a star in the making if there ever was one), Pascal Danae, a French-born musician of Caribbean ancestry and the versatile Mino Cinelu on percussion are only a few of the capable artists appearing on the recording. The tunes are a mixed bag, jazzy, sophisticated yet for the most part true to their sources; clearly Massi is trying her wings as a composer. Ilhem (&quot;Inspiration&quot;) a percussive gem fronted by chiming plucked strings, is infectiously extroverted and packs a strong West African/Touareg flavor, while Khalouni (&quot;Let Me&quot;), a North African-Iberian confection sung with a wonderful male singer named Rabah Kaifa, gets the blood moving. But the title track, with its limp Brazilian-inspired melody and MOR-like string arrangements, is less effective. Ultimately, although Massi's former one-on-one, almost perilously intimate rapport with the listener seems somewhat refracted these days, her message is as timely as ever. Her sensuous alto voice remains swooningly flexible yet serenely unadulterated, a miracle of confident, sensitive femininity.\n-- amazon.com\n\nTracks\n01- Mesk Elil (Honeysuckle)\n02- Kilyoum (Soon)\n03- Ilham (Inspiration)\n04- Miwana (I Won't Forget My Roots)\n05- Dardjedi (My Grandfather's House)\n06- Denya Wezmen (That's Life)\n07- Tell Me Why\n08- Hagda Wala Akter (There's Worse)\n09- Khalouni (Let Me)\n10- Malou (Why Is My Heart Sad)\n11- Mahli Remix\n12- Ilham Remix (mino cinelu fast version)\n13- Ilham Remix (mino cinelu slow version)\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0faaa4d701ce092c34c577ad56e01e28e35f77b5","amp;dn":"Souad+Massi+-+Mesk+Elil+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0faaa4d701ce092c34c577ad56e01e28e35f77b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,170,164,215,1,206,9,44,52,197,119,173,86,224,30,40,227,95,119,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
