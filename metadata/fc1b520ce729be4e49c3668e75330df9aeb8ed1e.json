There are still some duplicate buildings in the city but not very noticeable in my opinion. Credit to _snakeye for the original files. Step 4 in the instructions is a new step to follow vs the original upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc1b520ce729be4e49c3668e75330df9aeb8ed1e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+US+Cities+X+Las+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc1b520ce729be4e49c3668e75330df9aeb8ed1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,27,82,12,231,41,190,78,73,195,102,142,117,51,13,249,174,184,237,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
