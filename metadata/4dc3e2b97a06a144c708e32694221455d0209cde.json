The organization was founded in 1936 when advertising first flooded the mass media. Consumers lacked a reliable source of information they could depend on to help them distinguish hype from fact and good products from bad ones. Since then CR has filled that vacuum with a broad range of consumer information. To maintain its independence and impartiality, CR accepts no outside advertising and no free samples and employs several hundred mystery shoppers and technical experts to buy and test the products it evaluates.\n\n Consumer Reports, is one of the top-circulation magazines in the country, and ConsumerReports.org has the most subscribers of any website of its kind. In addition, the company pubishes two newslettersÃ¢â‚¬â€Consumer Reports on Health and Consumer Reports Money AdviserÃ¢â‚¬â€and ShopSmart magazine, which helps you make smart choices and get the most for your money every day. They have combined subscriptions of more than 8 million. All of CRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is informed by the more than 1 million readers who respond to our Annual Ballot &amp; Questionnaire, among the largest and most comprehensive consumer studies in the world. In 2008, CR also launched several initiatives, including ConsumerReportsHealth.org and the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center, which serve to educate and empower consumers to make more informed health-care decisions and to help change the market.\n\n To further advance its mission, Consumer Reports employs a dedicated staff of lobbyists, grassroots organizers, and outreach specialists who work with the organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than 600,000 online activists to change legislation and the marketplace in favor of the consumer interest.\n\n The organization generates more than $200 million in revenue, and a staff totaling more than 600 work at CR's 50 state-of-the-art labs and offices in Yonkers, N.Y.; its 327-acre Auto Test Center in East Haddam, Conn.; and our three advocacy offices, in Washington, D.C., Austin, Texas, and San Francisco. Consumer Reports is governed by a board of 18 directors who are elected by CU members and meet three times a year.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc3e2b97a06a144c708e32694221455d0209cde","amp;dn":"Consumer+Reports+-+June+2014+%28New+Car+Ratings+and+Reviews+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc3e2b97a06a144c708e32694221455d0209cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,195,226,185,122,6,161,68,199,8,227,38,148,34,20,85,208,32,156,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
