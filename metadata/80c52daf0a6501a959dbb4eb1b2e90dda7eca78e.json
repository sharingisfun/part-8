Following the predominant world music slant of 2008's Susquehanna and the 2009 ska album Skaboy JFK, White Teeth, Black Thoughts marks the Cherry Poppin' Daddies' first album since their 1997 compilation Zoot Suit Riot to focus exclusively on swing and jazz music, eschewing the ska, rock and pop influences which typically feature on their albums.\n\nA two-disc &quot;deluxe&quot; version of White Teeth, Black Thoughts was released concurrently with the main swing album, featuring an additional full-length album of material composed in an &quot;Americana&quot; vein covering rockabilly, country and western swing.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nWhite Teeth, Black Thoughts\n\n1.\t&quot;The Babooch&quot;\n2.\t&quot;I Love American Music&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Whiskey Jack&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Doug the Jitterbug&quot; \n5.\t&quot;White Teeth, Black Thoughts&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Brown Flight Jacket&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Bloodshot Eyes&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Jake's Frilly Panties&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Huffin' Muggles&quot; \n10.\t&quot;I Want a Bowlegged Woman&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Concrete Man Blues&quot; \n\nDeluxe Edition Bonus Disk\t\n\n1.\t&quot;Tchoupitoulas Congregation&quot; (featuring Buckwheat Zydeco)\n2.\t&quot;You Wiped Your Ass With My Heart&quot; \n3.\t&quot;Peckerheads and Badasses&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Throwback Man&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Subway Killer&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Flat Butts and Beer Guts&quot; (featuring Zoot Horn Rollo)\t\n7.\t&quot;Platform Shoes&quot; \n8.\t&quot;Ragged Ol' Flag&quot; \n9.\t&quot;Nuages&quot; \n10.\t&quot;The Babooch (Director's Cut)&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c52daf0a6501a959dbb4eb1b2e90dda7eca78e","amp;dn":"Cherry+Poppin+%27Daddies+-+White+Teeth+Black+Thoughts+%28Deluxe+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c52daf0a6501a959dbb4eb1b2e90dda7eca78e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,197,45,175,10,101,1,169,89,219,180,235,27,46,144,221,167,236,167,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
