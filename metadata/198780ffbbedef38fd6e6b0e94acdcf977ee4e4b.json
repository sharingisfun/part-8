With a razor-sharp intellect and an instinct for popular storytelling, she offers counter-intuitive, actionable guidance for making better choicesÃ¢â‚¬â€whether you are a business-person, a professional, a patient, or a parent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:198780ffbbedef38fd6e6b0e94acdcf977ee4e4b","amp;dn":"Eyes+Wide+Open+How+to+Make+Smart+Decisions+in+a+Confusing+World+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"198780ffbbedef38fd6e6b0e94acdcf977ee4e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,135,128,255,187,237,239,56,253,110,107,14,148,172,220,249,119,238,78,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
