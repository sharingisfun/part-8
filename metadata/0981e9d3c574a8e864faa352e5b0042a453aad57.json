It contains no gluten and no grain, and is low in digestive carbs and high in fiber, making it a favorite among Paleo, gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, and low-glycemic dieters. In addition to what coconut flour doesn't contain, what it does contain is just as impressive. Not only is it packed with protein, but it also contains four times more fiber than oat bran; just a few tablespoons provides you with between 25 to 50 percent of your daily required intake! Unlike gluten-free flour mixes, however, coconut flour may be used on its own and contains only one, all-natural ingredient coconut. Yet its pure, slightly sweet taste is subtle enough that even coconut haters won't be able to detect it, and it lends itself perfectly to baked goods, creating results far superior to many other gluten-free treats. One bite of light and moist coconut flour bread is sure to have you addicted!\n\nInside, you'll learn how to bake wonderful muffins, cakes, cookies, savory bites and more with this amazing flour, which is now easy to find in most grocery stores and online. No fillers, additives, and gums here - just simple, all-natural treats such as:\n\n* Cheddar Biscuits * Skillet Cornbread * Chocolate Chip Scones * Spiced Pumpkin Bread * Carrot Cake * Chocolate Layer Cake * Red Velvet Cupcakes * Pesto Flatbread Pizza * Garlic-Cauliflower Breadsticks * Spinach Mushroom Feta CrÃƒÂªpes * Coconut Shrimp with Sweet Chili Dipping Sauce\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/7zl3cvjkr/Erica.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/7zl3cvjkr/Erica.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nErica Kerwien is a kitchen chemist and founder of Comfy Belly (www.comfybelly.com), a valuable resource for healthy, great-tasting recipes that are easy to make at home, using simple, nutrient-dense ingredients.
