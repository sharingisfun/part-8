History went on without him - Russian Premier\n\n    Romanov signed a historic peace treaty with the Allies and the free\n\n    world remained free. Now it's Yuri's turn to make history, and wreak\n\n    vengeance on his foes.\n\n    \n\n    In hidden bases and underground labs, Yuri has been perfecting his own\n\n    means for his turn at world domination. Refining his mind-control\n\n    technologies, he's created an army of terrors, from mind-controlling\n\n    tanks to long-range psychics, whose brains are their biggest weapons.\n\n    After all, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.\n\n    It's time for Yuri's Revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db926d012357571ff6bab9f306d33eabcf22482a","amp;dn":"COMMAND.AND.CONQUER.RED.ALERT.2.YURIS.REVENGE-DEViANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db926d012357571ff6bab9f306d33eabcf22482a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,146,109,1,35,87,87,31,246,186,185,243,6,211,62,171,207,34,72,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
