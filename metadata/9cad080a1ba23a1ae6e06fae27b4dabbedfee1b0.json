A wide variety of content is included for both languages, as well as a large collection of choral effects (shouts, sweeps, clusters, etc.).\n\n2 masterfully mixed composite microphone positions (stage and hall), carefully blended from an array of 10 discreet large diaphragm Neumann Microphones, with wide pairs ranging in distance from 1 meter to 25 meters.
