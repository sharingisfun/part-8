Different users can create different Lockers with different passwords as well. With Folder Lock, you can choose either to encrypt using 256-bit AES on-the-fly encryption or lock files, folders and drives anywhere on your computer. Each Locker can contain your encrypted files as well as your personal list of locked items. \n\nFurthermore, Folder Lock's options like hack monitoring, stealth mode, data shredding, history cleaning, auto protection, portable USB autoplay feature &amp; virtual keyboard can enhance file locking and encryption beyond anything ever achieved.
