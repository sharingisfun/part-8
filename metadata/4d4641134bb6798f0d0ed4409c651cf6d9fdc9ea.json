Reflecting the varied and creative spirit of the neighborhood, this MASCHINE Expansion provides drum sounds, percussion, and a wide selection of sampled phrases to capture the deep, smoky sound of soulful modern hip hop.\n\nThe sounds in CONANT GARDENS were created exclusively by Amp Fiddler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ renowned artist and producer, studio wizard, former keyboardist with Parliament/Funkadelic, and long-time collaborator and mentor of the late, legendary J Dilla. Amp is also in the privileged position of having access to sounds from J DillaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extensive collection.\n\nThe patterns provided cover the eclectic spectrum of DetroitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical heritage, from Amp FiddlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s layered, melodic phrases to driving bass and drums from special guest stars Black Milk and DJ Dez. This unique combination of rhythm and melody puts all the ingredients for the Detroit sound at your fingertips.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d4641134bb6798f0d0ed4409c651cf6d9fdc9ea","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Conant+Gardens+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d4641134bb6798f0d0ed4409c651cf6d9fdc9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,70,65,19,75,182,121,143,13,14,212,64,156,101,28,246,217,253,201,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
