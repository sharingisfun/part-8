Armies of skeletons, swarms of\nwasps, and lumbering ogres lurk everywhere. Evil is spreading like\nwildfire. And you're the only one who can put an end to it.\n\nScattered across the kingdom are seven ancient major crystals which\ntogether invoke the power of the Orb. Without it, you have no hope\nof defeating your fire-breathing nemesis. You will creep through\ndungeons and castles, explore the wilderness, encounter traps, curses,\nand puzzles on your quest to unearth the crystals. It may take months.\nIt may take years. It may take away any hope you ever had of living a\nnormal, productive, twentieth-century life.\n\nDarkstone is a classic hack'n'slash game with everything a good game of\nits kind should have: randomly generated loot, four character classes,\na well-implemented cooperative mode, and four difficulty levels that use\nthe well-known Diablo-style formula of each level being the possibility\nof further progression for you character.
