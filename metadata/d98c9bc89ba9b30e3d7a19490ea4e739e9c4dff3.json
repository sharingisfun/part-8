I watched it and absolutely loved it. In the ensuing two decades I have Studied Film History and the art of film making. I have debated Film Theory and criticism with some of the country's most film-smart people and have worked extensively in the film industry. And very rarely through all of this was Meet John Doe mentioned. The other day I saw A copy of the film in a used video store, remembered it from my youth and promptly bought it. And after viewing it again I have to say it is definitely one of the finest motion-pictures I have ever seen. It has to be one of the most under-rated movies ever made. The social commentary exhibited is one of the boldest that the medium has ever presented, especially considering the time it was made. A time when media propaganda was a driving force for home-shore morale at the beginning of WWII. Capra and langs techniques in this work are absolutely astounding. The riot scene should be looked upon as ground breaking. The performances (both the lead and supporting) are among some of the finest and most endearing of the time. Needless to say I'm going to be toot this films horn for quite some time. (I think I'll go watch it again.) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d98c9bc89ba9b30e3d7a19490ea4e739e9c4dff3","amp;dn":"Meet+John+Doe+%5B1941%5D%40+.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d98c9bc89ba9b30e3d7a19490ea4e739e9c4dff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,140,155,200,155,169,179,14,61,122,25,73,14,164,231,57,233,196,223,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
