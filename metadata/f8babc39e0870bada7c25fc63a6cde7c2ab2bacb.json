In 1967, I am Curious (Yellow) survived a court battle in America to gain moderate distribution stateside, which helped break down the barriers around the on-screen waggling of male and female genitalia, as well as (for the time) graphic depictions of sexuality. The filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s victory helped usher in a bold new era in Hollywood that included the MPAA ratings board that soon allowed for the wide release of good-to-great films that would not otherwise have survived censorship, like Midnight Cowboy and Last Tango in Paris. However, removed from this intriguing historical context, I am Curious (Yellow) is not particularly riveting or shocking filmmaking. In fact, while there is plenty of full frontal nudity going on here, the movie is much more explicitly pedantic than erotic.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting element of the film is its unusual bending of conventions. I am Curious (Yellow) melds fictional elements ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including the sexually saucy bits that helped it garner its racy reputation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with documentary footage that sometimes pushes up against the borderline of the now-popular mockumentary genre. Director Vilgot SjomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stated purpose is to film a story that will raise class consciousness in his native Sweden, and has gathered together a young and inexperienced cast and crew that includes Lena, a 22 year-old drama student, and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje, a 28 year-old clothing (or is it car? Or both?) salesman who may or may not actually be the crowned prince of Sweden. And, in a neat touch of meta-filmmaking, while they are engaged in making this film, we are engaged in the activity of watching them make this film, so that often, just as we get comfortable with the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach, as, for example, when we are presented with 10 minutes of the politically naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve Lena Nyman interviewing a parade of Swedes to elicit their opinions on the existence (or not) of a Swedish class system, Sjoman shakes it up with a cut to he and Nyman playfully cavorting in bed. Or, just as we are getting caught up in an argument between the very naked Lena and her fictional and apparently actual boyfriend BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rje, Vilgot cuts to a shot of he and the film crew guiltily eavesdropping on the event, ever-blurring the lines between what is real and what is not. We wonder if the actors are engaging in an affair both on screen and off, or if it is just more of the directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conceit, keeping us consistently off-kilter and unsure about the reality of the events we are witnessing. This uncertainty is clearly part of VilgotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point, as he toys with our perceptions of the difference between fact and fiction in a world increasingly shaped by our mass-media manipulated perceptions of reality.\n\nI am Curious (Yellow) is not a particularly powerful film, as its constant nudge-nudge wink-wink self-awareness and its blatant proletariat proselytizing keep us at an ironical distance. Furthermore, the material that made the film so famous, the plentiful shots of full-frontal nudity and extensive copulation, seem awfully tame by todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s standards. While SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶man sprinkles his film with some interesting relationships and smatterings of strong emotion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whether humour, anger or confusion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to nearly overcome the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pedantic limitations, I suspect that I am Curious (Yellow) will remain largely, well, a curiosity.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img167.imageshack.us/img167/3003/snap004bxl1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img167.imageshack.us/img167/3003/snap004bxl1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n---------not my rip---------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,645,264,896 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:01:50\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x464 (AR: 1.379)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1530 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.215 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2 * \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
