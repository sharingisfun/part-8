Terakaft's completion of Tinariwen's thought is no accident-- the two bands are closely linked, and several songs on Terakaft's debut album are written by members of Tinariwen. Ahk Issudar does in some ways feel like a continuation of Aman Iman-- the style is similar but even more stripped down, and the songs have that familiar sense of longing, evoking shifting landscapes in wide open spaces.\n\n...\n\nWhat separates this album from those made by Terakaft's colleagues is its uniquely ramshackle approach to what is essentially organic psychedelia. Acoustic guitars make a few appearances, and some songs, such as &quot;Soubhanallah&quot;, have an open, free-flowing character that makes it feel like they simply blew up off the peak of a dune and became pieces of music. The all-acoustic closer offers a different sound, with more independence for each voice and a folky (in the Western sense) arrangement. This genre has reached a point of diversity where terms like &quot;desert rock&quot; and &quot;desert blues&quot; have become inadequate-- it needs its own name. Akh Issudar, however it's labeled, is another reminder that this corner of the world is producing some of the best and most rewarding music out there.\n-- Pitchfork\n\nTracks\n01- Akh Issudar\n02- TenereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ Wer Tat Zinchegh\n03- Djer Aman\n04- Intidgagen\n05- Soubhanallah\n06- Legh Assistane Dagh Aitma\n07- Amidinine Wa Dagh Nohar Timtar\n08- Ewor Imdane\n09- Haran Bardan\n10- Amdagh\n11- Iswegh Atay\n12- Arghane Manine\n13- Islegh Teghram\n14- Tarha A Issasnanane\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4dd2d90a395d30e1996c878b3c7e5625c754246","amp;dn":"Terakaft+-+Akh+Issudar+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4dd2d90a395d30e1996c878b3c7e5625c754246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,221,45,144,163,149,211,14,25,150,200,120,179,199,229,98,92,117,66,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
