Essential reading.&quot; -Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \n\nRenowned economist Nouriel Roubini electrified the financial community by predicting the current crisis before others in his field saw it coming. This myth-shattering book reveals the methods he used to foretell the current crisis and shows how those methods can help us make sense of the present and prepare for the future. Using an unconventional blend of historical analysis with masterful knowledge of global economics, Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, a journalist and professor of economic history, present a vital and timeless book that proves calamities to be not only predictable but also preventable and, with the right medicine, curable. \n\nIn years gone by, they called Nouriel Roubini &quot;Doctor Doom.&quot; Now, the NYU professor who predicted our recent economic woes attracts more laudatory nicknames and much more watchful attention. Like his previous works, his new Crisis Economics far transcends mere jeremiads. Cutting across centuries, countries and continents, Dr. Roubini's comprehensive analysis encompasses a host of regional economic disasters that he argues manifest clear causes and possible corrective measures. Measured words in troubled times.\n\nMay 2010\nPublisher: Penguin Group \nHardcover , 368pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58460b77b77c4404eb3cd18cfc273c838a0791c7","amp;dn":"Crisis+Economics%3A+A+Crash+Course+in+the+Future+of+Finance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58460b77b77c4404eb3cd18cfc273c838a0791c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,70,11,119,183,124,68,4,235,60,209,140,252,39,60,131,138,7,145,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
