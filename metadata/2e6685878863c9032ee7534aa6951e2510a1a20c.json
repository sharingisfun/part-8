The night after the teenager's disappearance, ex-con Dylan Kyle was stopped for drunk driving. An article of Sashi's clothing was found in his truck, and a police videotape of his drunken explanation under interrogation sealed his fate at trial. Now, just days from Kyle's execution, Sashi's mother visits Jack Swyteck, doing pro bono work at the Freedom Institute, and delivers shocking news: &quot;Sashi called me.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe police dismiss the call as a cruel hoax. The State Attorney refuses to consider the new evidence, insisting the case is closed. The governor has already signed the death warrant. An innocent man may be executed and time is running outâ€”unless his lawyers can locate Sashi.\r\n\r\nA man of principle who believes in justice, Jack jumps into the investigation. But the deeper he digs the more he discovers that nothing is what it appears to be. Not the victim. Not her alleged killer. And definitely not Sashi's parents, whose grief ruptured their marriage, each openly blaming the other for what happened to their daughter.\r\n\r\nAs their gut-wrenching and hopelessly conflicting version of events unfolds in a Miami courtroom, it becomes clear there is something even more difficult to find than a long-missing girl...\r\n\r\nThe truth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6685878863c9032ee7534aa6951e2510a1a20c","amp;dn":"GONE+AGAIN+-+James+Grippando+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6685878863c9032ee7534aa6951e2510a1a20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,102,133,135,136,99,201,3,46,231,83,74,166,149,30,37,16,161,162,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
