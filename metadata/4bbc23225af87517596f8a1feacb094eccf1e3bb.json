As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss PeregrineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehowÃ¢â‚¬â€impossible though it seemsÃ¢â‚¬â€they may still be alive. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss PeregrineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nRansom Riggs is an American writer and filmmaker best known for the book Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.\n\nRiggs was born in Maryland on a 200 year old farm, and grew up in Florida where he attended the Pine View School for the Gifted. He studied English literature at Kenyon College, and studied film at the University of Southern California. His work on short films for the Internet and blogging for Mental Floss got him a job writing The Sherlock Holmes Handbook which was released as a tie-in to the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film.\n\nRiggs had collected curious vernacular photographs and approached his publisher, Quirk Books, about using some of them in a picture book. On the suggestion of an editor, Riggs used the photographs as a guide from which to put together a narrative. The resulting book was Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children which made The New York Times Best Seller list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bbc23225af87517596f8a1feacb094eccf1e3bb","amp;dn":"MISS+PEREGRINE%26rsquo%3BS+HOME+FOR+PECULIAR+CHILDREN+%7CEPUB%7C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bbc23225af87517596f8a1feacb094eccf1e3bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,188,35,34,90,248,117,23,89,111,138,31,234,203,9,78,204,241,227,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
