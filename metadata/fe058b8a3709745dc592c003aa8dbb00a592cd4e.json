Then, the single for the title track\n&quot;One Nation Under A Groove&quot; came out in June or July\nof '78, and it was unlike anything that had ever been\nheard up to that time! It was an immediate house party,\nblock party and skating rink / dance floor filler!\nA bunch of lesser funk bands of the day tried to come\nout with their own copycat spins on this song.\n(The Barkays &quot;Move Your Boogie Body&quot;, Raydio &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;\nand &quot;For Those Who Like To Groove&quot;, and Herbie Hancock's\n&quot;Ready Or Not&quot; to name a few!)\n\nThe other highlights of this album were: &quot;Groovalliegence&quot;,\n&quot;Who Says A Funk Band Can't Play Rock&quot;,\n&quot;Cholly (Funk Gettin' Ready To Roll!)&quot; and\nMichael &quot;Kidd Funkadelic&quot; Hampton's scorching live\nrendition of the early Funkadelic psychedelic-rock\nclassic &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, which was first played by\nthe late great Eddie &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; Hazel in 1971,\nand has since become as essential to rock guitarists\nas &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; or\n&quot;Runnin' With The Devil&quot; is!\n\n**Honorable Mention** goes to the song\n&quot;P.M.S.B.W.P.E. Squad (The D.D. Chasers)&quot; (LOL!!)\nI love the laid back funky acid rockish groove with\nGarry Shider's soulful vocal adlibs in the backdrop,\ncompletely juxtaposed against George Clinton's insane\ncall &amp; response rant about the BS, mental gamesmenship,\nphony &amp; silly social conventions and other societal\nrestraints which Clinton puts (quite literally!)\ninto scat-a-logical terms! (-:\n&quot;Think!!--It Ain't Illegal Yet! &quot; Indeed...\n\n&quot;Into You&quot; is mellow funk that you just laid back,\nfired up a jizzle and grooved to!\nNew-comers to the P-Funk, who think in linear and\nlogical terms will not understand Clinton's symbolisms\nand seemingly nonsensical approach to lyric writing,\nbut there was definitely a message within all that madness!--\nYou just have to free your mind... and you know the rest! (-:\nThe groove is inevitable though!--If you can't feel it,\nthen check your local morgue, because you're probably dead! (-:\nEnjoy the funk kidz! \n\nIf you are a Funkadelic-Parliament-George Clinton fan check my list and bookmark it as I will be adding the whole collection in the .flac format so you get every sound.\n\nDone in Flac to give you more of what you're funkin' for!!!\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe058b8a3709745dc592c003aa8dbb00a592cd4e","amp;dn":"Funkadelic+-+One+Nation+under++a+Groove+.flac+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe058b8a3709745dc592c003aa8dbb00a592cd4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,5,139,138,55,9,116,93,197,146,192,3,170,141,187,0,165,146,205,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
