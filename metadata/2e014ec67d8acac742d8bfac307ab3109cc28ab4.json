It consists of four CDs, covering the history of the band from its formation in 1967 up to 1992. The set features several previously unreleased studio tracks, new remixes, live recordings, and a different version of the international hit single &quot;Tusk&quot;.  The extended version of Stevie Nicks' &quot;Gypsy&quot; was also included for the first time on a commercial release, and this collection also marked the first time Nicks' &quot;Silver Springs&quot; had appeared on a full-length Fleetwood Mac album. It was originally intended for inclusion on the international multi-million selling album Rumours, however, it was removed from the tracklisting at the last minute. It was issued in 1976 as the B-side to the single &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; but the song had never been released commercially since. The inclusion of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; on this collection marked Nicks' first departure from the band in 1992 when Mick Fleetwood refused to allow the track to appear on Nicks' retrospection compilation Timespace Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Very Best of Stevie Nicks, instead intending it for 25 Years Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Chain.[citation needed] The disagreement was ultimately resolved and the song itself was eventually released as a single five years later in 1997, taken from the album The Dance after a live performance from the sell-out tour of the same name.  A condensed 2-CD version of the compilation was also available containing highlights from the 4-CD set. The popular hit single &quot;Hold Me&quot; was only available on this format as was the track &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot;. The new track &quot;Love Shines&quot; was released as a single in the UK, whereas the track &quot;Paper Doll&quot; was released in the US instead.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Paper Doll\n[02] Love Shines\n[03] Stand Back [Live]\n[04] Crystal\n[05] Isn't It Midnight?
