It includes \ndetailed information about how to produce and use the Rick Simpson Oil \nin the treatment of practically all illnesses.\n\nIt also includes a special chapter Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cannabis in the Political WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nby Max Igan and a comprehensive interview about the many uses of the oil, \nwritten by Jindrich Bayer. Everyone who considers using \ncannabis/hemp extracts as medicine should read this e-book.\n\nThe term Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rick Simpson OilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ refers to extremely potent and sedative \npurified decarboxylated cannabis resin with 95-98% THC. \nThis substance can be used with great success to cure, treat \nor control cancer, pain, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, infections, \ninflammations, blood pressure, depressions, sleeping problems etc. \nRead more about how to produce and use this oil properly in the e-book.\n\nQuote from the e-book:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“How did you come to discover how to cure cancer and \nmany other illnesses with hemp?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I consider myself just one of many who have found a way \nto cure cancer and I certainly was not the first one to produce \nan essential oil from the hemp plant. A radio broadcast told me \nthat THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) kills cancer cells way back in the 1970s, \nso I do not claim that it was me who found the cure. \nStill, it does appear that I am the first to supply this medication \nto vast numbers of patients to treat their cancers and other conditions \nin a more effective and sensible way.\n\nIn addition, I continued to report my findings openly to \nthe general public after the government and all they control \nturned their backs on this issue. Since this plant has been used \nin medicine for thousands of years, I really do not think that anyone \ncan make the claim that they alone discovered its true medical values.\n\nThe only thing that I can really claim is that I discovered \nthe proper way to produce and use this substance and I developed \nand published a protocol to make it more simple for patients \nto enjoy its use. As often as I could, I provided the medicine \nfree of charge and I openly reported my findings to anyone who \nwould listen, expecting that sooner or later \nsomeone would do something about it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n--------------------\n\nThe revenue from this book supports Rick's living expenses \nand helps further his mission to bring cannabis extract medicine to the world. \n\nIf you support this cause, please buy the book.\nThere's also money needed to translate the book \nand to get it published in hard copy.\n\n--------------------\n\nI, the uploader, do not wish to take revenue away from \nRick Simpson and the other people involved with phoenixtears.ca. \nI would prefer to just supply a link to where you can buy the book. \nBut since I know there are some people that want to see what \nthey get before they pay, others just don't have the money \nat the moment or don't have a way to pay and others have other \nreasons not to be able to buy it, I'm uploading it here.\nI think this message is too important to miss just because \nyou cannot buy it for whatever reason. \nIf you like it and support the work of Rick Simpson, \nspread the word, spread the book and spread the place \nwhere it can be bought. And buy it yourself, \neven when you've already read it. \nRick has been helping dozens of people free of charge and \nthis is a way in which you can contribute to his work.\nSo, buy the book.\n\nIt's 9.99 USD well invested in a better world.\n\n\nGood health to everyone!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b352c08d65c369587ea5858a81f9c43673fd9e","amp;dn":"Phoenix+Tears+-+Rick+Simpson+Oil+-+Natures+Answer+for+Cancer+-+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b352c08d65c369587ea5858a81f9c43673fd9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,179,82,192,141,101,195,105,88,126,165,133,138,129,249,196,54,115,253,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
