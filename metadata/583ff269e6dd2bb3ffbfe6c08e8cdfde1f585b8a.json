When Scudder's childhood friend Jack Ellery is murdered, presumably while attempting to atone for past sins, Scudder reluctantly begins his own investigation, with just one lead: Ellery's Alcoholics Anonymous list of people he wronged. One of them may be a killer, but that's not necessarily Scudder's greatest danger. Immersing himself in Ellery's world may lead him right back to the bar stool.\n\nIn a novel widely celebrated by critics and readers, Lawrence Block circle back to how it all began, reestablishing the Matthew Scudder series as one of the pinnacles of American detective fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583ff269e6dd2bb3ffbfe6c08e8cdfde1f585b8a","amp;dn":"A+Drop+of+the+Hard+Stuff+by+Lawrence+Block+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583ff269e6dd2bb3ffbfe6c08e8cdfde1f585b8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,63,242,105,230,221,43,179,255,191,230,192,142,140,223,222,31,88,91,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
