Among them were the decidedly electric Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Joining Muddy Waters (guitar/vocals) and Otis Spann (piano) on the aptly titled Fathers and Sons are three Butterfield Blues Band alumni: Michael Bloomfield (guitar), Sam Lay (drums), and leader Paul Butterfield (guitar). Further augmenting the personnel is Booker T. and the MG's Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn (bass) and Buddy Miles (drums) -- who cameos during the live &quot;Got My Mojo Workin'&quot; finale. This all-star cast helps reclaim some of Waters' fire, which had been summarily doused on his previous outing Electric Mud -- a tasteless pseudo-psychedelic disaster. The poorly executed scheme had been designed to introduce Waters' music to a younger and mostly white audience. In essence, Fathers and Sons is able to accomplish with musical integrity what Electric Mud couldn't through gimmickry. Additionally, the incorporation of the younger generation blues men solidified Waters stature as one of the pre-eminent forces in Chicago Blues to a decidedly fresh and underdeveloped audience. The disc is split between studio sides cut on April 21-23 and a half-hour live set. This performance, during the Super Cosmic Joy-Scout Jamboree, was documented on the evening following the final day of studio recording. The event was held at Auditorium Theater in (where else?) Chicago. Simplifying the process is Fathers and Sons set list, which consists of exclusively vintage Waters material. &quot;Mean Disposition&quot; and &quot;Standin' Round Cryin'&quot; drip with Bloomfield and Butterfield's nasty languid electric funk and feature Waters' determined and energized vocals. On the up-tempo blues/rockers &quot;Walking Thru the Park&quot; and &quot;Sugar Sweet&quot; the nimble and lyrical guitar passages meld the distance between Waters and the electric blues of Cream and Led Zeppelin~ \n\nTracklist:\n01.
