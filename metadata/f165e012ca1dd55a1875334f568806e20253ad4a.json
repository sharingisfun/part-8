The film follows their two-and-a-half year journey as it takes them through dogfights in the Nevada desert, night landings on aircraft carriers in the Atlantic, and eventually to the biggest challenge young officers face: wartime deployments to Iraq.\n\nThis is an awesome documentary, Easily the new Top Gun. Exceptionally professional photography, great aerial footage, a real A+. Not some shitty history channel documentary.\n\nIf you enjoy this, check out &quot;Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag&quot; in full 480p on HULU.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f165e012ca1dd55a1875334f568806e20253ad4a","amp;dn":"Speed+and+Angels%3A+Navy+fighter+pilot+school+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f165e012ca1dd55a1875334f568806e20253ad4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,101,224,18,202,29,213,90,24,117,51,79,86,136,6,226,2,83,173,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
