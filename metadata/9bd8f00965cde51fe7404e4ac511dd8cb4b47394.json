Starting with issue #622, the book for a second time had its title restored to Journey Into Mystery, which accompanied the launch of a new title, Mighty Thor. Thor's supporting cast returned as the focus of a run written by Kieron Gillen (who had written Thor from #604 to #614), and drawn by Doug Braithwaite. Starring was the Thor antagonist Loki, who had been reincarnated as a child following his sacrifice in the series Siege. Gillen's run was favorably reviewed, with one critic writing,\n\n    Gillen's work has always been big on theme and interconnectedness, and this is no exception. The finale encapsulates the run as a whole Ã¢â‚¬â€ ambitious, ambiguous, clever and uncompromising, as challenging as it is entertaining. Sometimes those qualities hurt it, and although sales were never especially healthy it's to Marvel's credit that they helped keep it afloat long enough for a proper ending when the alternative would have surely been easier.\n\nIn Gillen's final issue, a letter from Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Loki in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was published, in which he praised Gillen for his take on the character.\n\nWith issue #646, the focus of Journey into Mystery changed with its rebranding under the Marvel NOW! imprint. Written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Valerio Schiti, the series began starring the Marvel Asgardians, with the Lady Sif as its lead character.\n\nThe series was cancelled with #655 being the final issue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bd8f00965cde51fe7404e4ac511dd8cb4b47394","amp;dn":"Journey+Into+Mystery+v1+%26amp%3B+Thor+v1+%28600+-+655%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bd8f00965cde51fe7404e4ac511dd8cb4b47394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,216,240,9,101,205,229,31,231,64,78,74,197,17,221,140,180,180,115,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
