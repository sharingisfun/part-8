Estonia, a former Soviet republic that gained its independence in 1991 (the last Russian troops left in 1994), was a popular and affordable travel destination for Swedes. The Estonia was a type of ferry known as a &quot;ro-ro,&quot; which featured a smorgasbord, live music, dancing and drinking and allowed people to drive vehicles onto one end of the ship and drive off on the other end.\n\nFile Size ------- 348mb\nLength ---------- 44:38\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a553b621630c844d4b109d942aaac917d0a7b6d","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Sinking+of+the+Estonia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a553b621630c844d4b109d942aaac917d0a7b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,85,59,98,22,48,200,68,212,177,9,217,66,170,172,145,125,10,123,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
