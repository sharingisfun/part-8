Ahmed, the leader of the students' revolt, frees Sharif and three other prisoners, among them Huston, an American who has embezzled $200,000 from the Zahrain Oil Company. The fugitives capture an ambulance and, along with an Arabian nurse, Laila, flee from the city toward the border. During their trek across the desert, the convict Hassan is killed in a police trap; and the budding romance between Ahmed and Laila is cut short when the young student is shot down by a government strafing plane. Following the death of Tahar, another convict, the three lone survivors cross the frontier and reach a port on the Persian Gulf. Sharif and Laila make plans to return and continue their fight, and Huston goes in search of a ship which will take him to Cairo and his ill-gotten gains.\n\nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nSharif (Yul Brynner) ÃƒÂ© um homem rebelde que resolveu pegar nas armas para combater a corrupÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o do governo e as forÃƒÂ§as do imperialismo no Oeste americano.
