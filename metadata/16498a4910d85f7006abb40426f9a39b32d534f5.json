Designer and writer Kevin McCloud witnesses the structural, financial and emotional journey of each build over many months as the plans unfold into buildings with their own unique stories and designs. This series features an enormous ultra modern house that has to blend into the Midlothian countryside, a space age minimalist white cube in Bristol and in Monmouth a couple set about the design and build of an 'Addams family' Gothic styled dream house. The only thing that each of the six featured constructions have in common is that they are new builds and started life as a blank canvas.\n\n\n1)  Underground House \nKevin McCloud meets a couple building an ultra modern, low maintenance home in the back garden of their elegant Regency house in Cheltenham, despite opposition from the neighbours.\n\n2)  Sugarcube House \nCommercial architect Martin Pease embarks on a personal project of building a home in Bristol for his family, with a high concept design that's difficult to pull off.\n\n3)  Gothic House \nInspired by their love of gothic architecture and horror movies, Jo and Shaun Bennett decide to build an Addams Family-style house in Monmouth, but they soon realise this is a big challenge\n\n4)  Futuristic Bungalow \nBill and Jean Letley of Maidstone are not only building a new bungalow in their back garden, but also embracing cutting-edge technologies to create a super-efficient, highly contemporary home.\n\n5)  Lime Kiln House \nPru and Richard Irvine plan to build a bespoke family home in the Midlothian countryside, but the plot of land is an old industrial site with lime kilns and they come with conditions.\n\n6)  Pre Fabricated Modernist House \nBath may be famous for its Georgian architecture, but Tiffany Wood and her husband Jonny have chosen it as the location to build themselves a striking Modernist home.\n\n7)  Stone Barn Conversion \nRobert and Jane Ellis decided to convert an isolated hilltop ruin in the Forest of Dean in Herefordshire. Adding modern steel and glass they created a mouth watering contemporary structure. They decided to keep as much of the old barn as it is. The new additions are clearly modern and new, with a clear line separating old and new. The old barn was very dark with no real windows and since planners ruled that no additional windows can be added, they had to use as much of available light as they could. The result is a surprisingly bright space, filled with lots of steel, stainless struts, glass and the best of modern furniture, where new and old are sitting in a very easy dialog.\n\n8)  Cedar Clad Family Home \nTheo and Elaine Leijser hoped to bring a bit of Dutch style to Scotland in the building of their first family home - a colourful, contemporary three storey house, with a striking cedar clad exterior. The couple stumbled across the perfect plot overlooking the beautiful Campsie Fells near Glasgow, bought it and began to plan their dream build.\n\n9)  Water Tower Conversion \nFor six years Bruno and Denise Del Tufo stared at the large concrete water tower at the bottom of their garden trying to figure out what to do with it. It's a very rare object - a square water tower on stilts designed by architect Edwin Lutyens, who built it to supply the manor house nearby. It's not exactly beautiful but Bruno and Denise feel very protective towards it. When they sold their house, they were worried that someone might knock the tower down, so they decided to try and find a way to live in this huge, concrete monster.\n\n10)  Garden House \nCharting the building plans of Christine and Peter Benjamin who are hoping to construct a small retirement home within a walled garden in the grounds of the manor house where they used to live.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1220/59pe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1220/59pe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5784/9dw3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5784/9dw3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/140/wadz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/140/wadz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7259/4c49.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img203.imageshack.us/img203/7259/4c49.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/3216/mqe7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/3216/mqe7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3259/0g4j.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3259/0g4j.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/h31o.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3858/h31o.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6051/62l6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6051/62l6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/5885/dxie.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/5885/dxie.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a1e9c8c6c9e1ed928f90&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1905 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 160 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 643 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1369460/Grand-Designs-Kevin-McCloud-10-greatest-architectural-homes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1369460/Grand-Designs-Kevin-McCloud-10-greatest-architectural-homes.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16498a4910d85f7006abb40426f9a39b32d534f5","amp;dn":"Grand+Designs+Series+6+04of10+Futuristic+Bungalow+DVDRip+x264+AA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16498a4910d85f7006abb40426f9a39b32d534f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,73,138,73,16,216,95,112,6,171,180,4,38,249,163,155,50,213,52,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
