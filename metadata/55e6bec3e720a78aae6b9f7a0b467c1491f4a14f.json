The conceit extends to their visual style: Carla Speed McNeil's rough, chiseled art for the compassionate hardboiled detective story &quot;Frank Ironwine,&quot; for instance, draws more on pulp traditions than spandex conventions. Ellis's dark SF world of a future dragged down by humanity's own frailties has power, but the one-shot nature of the series sometimes works against it. &quot;Angel Stomp Future&quot; (drawn in magnificently gross, squirming detail by Juan Jose Ryp) is supposed to be science fiction, but Ellis gets so caught up in a lecture about his pet themes that he neglects to give it a plot, and the aviator comic &quot;Quit City&quot; (with clear-lined, photo-inspired art by Laurenn McCubbin) devotes most of its space to setting up characters we'll never see again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e6bec3e720a78aae6b9f7a0b467c1491f4a14f","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis+Apparat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e6bec3e720a78aae6b9f7a0b467c1491f4a14f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,230,190,195,231,32,167,138,174,107,159,122,11,70,124,20,145,244,161,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
