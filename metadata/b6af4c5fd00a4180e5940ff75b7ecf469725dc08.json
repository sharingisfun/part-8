It is remembered as one of the first hip-hop crews to use a live band, and their positive, uplifting lyrics have made the group forerunners of alternative hip hop and jazz hip-hop.\n\nOriginally, the group was known as the Stetson Brothers, after Stetson Hats, but it changed its name to Stetsasonic for its debut, On Fire (1986, 1986 in music). [1]The album received mixed reviews, though the follow-ups, In Full Gear and Blood, Sweat &amp; No Tears were critically acclaimed. A 1988 New York Times article said that the group mirrored the rise of artistic, profound rap music: &quot;While pop's political commentary often seems secondary to catchy melodies and commercial acceptability, rap's tough sound sharpens its commentary&quot;.[2] As a &quot;hip hop band&quot;, dependent on instruments as well as turntables, the group was also known for live shows, though sometimes the &quot;rap-show format prevented Stetsasonic from employing the band instrumentation and studio layering that make their records so distinctive.&quot;[3]\n\nIn Full Gear is the highly acclaimed second album from hip hop band Stetsasonic. The album is considered revolutionary in style and production for its time period. Originally released in 1988, Tommy Boy Records re-released the album in 2001 with three bonus alternate versions of the single &quot;Talkin' All That Jazz&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n\n1 &quot;In Full Gear&quot;    Prince Paul Daddy-O, Frukwan, Wise, Delite \n2 &quot;DBC Let The Music Play&quot;   DBC Daddy-O, Frukwan, Wise, Delite \n3 &quot;Freedom Or Death&quot;   Daddy-O Daddy-O \n4 &quot;Float On&quot;   Vincent F.
