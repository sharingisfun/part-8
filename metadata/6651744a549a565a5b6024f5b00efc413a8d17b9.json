Experts Alex Langlands and Annie Gray join them to tell the incredible story of our daily bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  1900s \r\nThe bakers have said goodbye to the brutal working conditions of the 1870s urban bakery. It is now 1900 and Britain's middle classes are enjoying the democratisation of luxury. Bakers were quick to cash in - this time; the bakers have an elegant shop on the high street. Their new workplace boasts huge steam-belching ovens, but it is the early 20th-century electric dough mixer that takes the hard work out of baking. The technology has changed beyond recognition and so has their trade. The bakers experience first-hand the incredible diversification their forebears underwent in order to stay in business. Now they are uniformed professionals who have to turn out a huge range of pastries, cakes and confectionary, as well as novelty breads, all typical of a late-Victorian bakery. At last, cake maker Harpreet Baura can take the lead, even though there were no female master bakers in 1900.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/89/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/63/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Victorian-Bakers-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2989 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06vn7sj","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6651744a549a565a5b6024f5b00efc413a8d17b9","amp;dn":"BBC+Victorian+Bakers+Series+1+3of3+1900s+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6651744a549a565a5b6024f5b00efc413a8d17b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,81,116,74,84,154,86,90,91,96,36,245,176,14,252,65,58,141,23,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
