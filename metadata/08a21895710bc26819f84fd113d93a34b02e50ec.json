FASTING, FEASTING takes on Desai's greatest theme: the intricate, delicate web of family conflict. It tells the moving story of Uma, the plain older daughter of an Indian family, tied to the household of her childhood and tending to her parents' every extravagant demand, and of her younger brother, Arun, across the world in Massachusetts, bewildered by his new life in college and the suburbs, where he lives with the Patton family. Published in Britain to rave reviews, FASTING, FEASTING is &quot;rich in the sensuous atmosphere, elegiac pathos, and bleak comedy at which the author excels&quot; (The Spectator). From the overpowering warmth of Indian culture to the cool center of the American family, it captures the physical -- and emotional -- fasting and feasting that define two distinct cultures. *(Times Literary Supplement)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08a21895710bc26819f84fd113d93a34b02e50ec","amp;dn":"Fasting%2C+Feasting+-+Anita+Desai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08a21895710bc26819f84fd113d93a34b02e50ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,162,24,149,113,11,194,104,25,248,79,209,19,217,58,52,176,46,80,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
