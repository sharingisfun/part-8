Tragedy Khadafi was in many ways the mastermind behind the project and was at the time considered an un-official 3rd member, he appears on more than half of the albums songs. Other guest appearances include Imam Thug, Castro, Mussolini, Mendosa, Troy Outlaw, Mobb Deep, and Busta Rhymes. Despite its strong underground-overtones, the album was surprisingly a commercial success, making the Rap/R&amp;B Top Five.\n\n1 &quot;Intro&quot; \n2 &quot;Bloody Money&quot; \n3 &quot;Driver's Seat&quot; \n4 &quot;Stick You&quot; \n5 &quot;Parole Violators&quot; \n6 &quot;Iraq (See the World)&quot; \n7 &quot;Live On Live Long&quot; \n8 &quot;Neva Die Alone&quot; \n9 &quot;T.O.N.Y.
