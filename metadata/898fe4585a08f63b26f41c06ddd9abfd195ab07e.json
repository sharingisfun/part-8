The responses of contemporary historians to these turbulent times reflect their diverse backgrounds - Christian and pagan, writing in both Greek and Latin, documenting church and state.\n\nThis volume is the first to offer an accessible survey of the lives and works of these varied figures. The first half of the book explores the structure, style, purpose and nature of their writings. The second half compares and contrasts the information the historians provide, and the views they express on some central topics. These range from historiography, government and religion to barbarian invasions, and the controversial emperors Julian 'The Apostate' and Theodosius.\n\n\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 1.7 MB, mobi 657 KB\nPublisher: Taylor and Francis\nISBN-10: 0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ415Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20458Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5 (Hardback)\nISBN-10: 0Ã¢â‚¬â€œ415Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20459Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3 (Paperback)\nLanguage: English\n\nNote: This was a straight conversion from azw3 to epub in Calibre, then to mobi from the epub.
