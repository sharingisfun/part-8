Melvin and James A. Scheer\nSciTech Publishing  | September 2012 | ISBN-10: 1891121537 | PDF | 800 pages | 31.4 mb\n\nPrinciples of Modern Radar: Advanced Techniques is a professional reference for practicing engineers that provides a stepping stone to advanced practice with indepth discussions of the most commonly used advanced techniques for radar design. It will also serve advanced radar academic and training courses with a complete set of problems for students as well as solutions for instructors. This book provides an introduction to advanced radar methods available, spanning the gamut of the most exciting radar capabilities, from exotic waveforms, to ultrahigh resolution 2D and 3D imaging methods, complex adaptive interference cancellation, multitarget tracking in dense scenarios and more. The most uptodate methods, such as multipleinput, multipleoutput (MIMO) are covered. All of this material is presented with the same careful balance of quantitative rigor and qualitative insight of Principles of Modern Radar: Basic Principles (SciTech 2010).\n\nBrief Contents\n1 Overview: Advanced Techniques in Modern Radar 1\nPART I Waveforms and Spectrum\n2 Advanced Pulse Compression Waveform Modulations\nand Techniques 19\n3 Optimal and Adaptive MIMO Waveform Design 87\n4 MIMO Radar 119\n5 Radar Applications of Sparse Reconstruction and\nCompressed Sensing 147\nPART II Synthetic Aperture Radar\n6 Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar 211\n7 Stripmap SAR 259\n8 Interferometric SAR and Coherent Exploitation 337\nPART III Array Processing and Interference\nMitigation Techniques\n9 Adaptive Digital Beamforming 401\n10 Clutter Suppression Using Space-Time Adaptive Processing 453\n11 Space-Time Coding for Active Antenna Systems 499\n12 Electronic Protection 529\nPART IV Post-Processing Considerations\n13 Introduction to Radar Polarimetry 589\n14 Automatic Target Recognition 631\n15 Multitarget, Multisensor Tracking 669\nPART V Emerging Techniques\n16 Human Detection With Radar: Dismount Detection 705\n17 Advanced Processing Methods for Passive\nBistatic Radar Systems 739\nAppendix A: Answers to Selected Problems 823\nIndex 829","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98db8c5d7e98704308b2643ddee4d2a7415e83e1","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Modern+Radar+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98db8c5d7e98704308b2643ddee4d2a7415e83e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,219,140,93,126,152,112,67,8,178,100,61,222,228,210,167,65,94,131,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
