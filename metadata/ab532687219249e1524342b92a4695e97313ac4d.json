So why has the sworn enemy of these benevolent aliens HATED humans for millennia? X-Files meet Independence Day when incredible events thrust Air Force Captains Jake Giard and Sandra Fitzpatrick into a decades-long global conspiracy to integrate humanity into a galactic government. However, as Jake finishes indoctrination into the program, it renders present-day Earth a disposable pawn in a galactic civil war. Unknown aliens with a dark secret raid the planet. Within and even below Washington DC, Jake fights through a post-apocalyptic hell, struggling to comprehend the enigmatic aftermath of the first attack.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast, Sandra's squadron smashes against the invading aliens. Thrown to ground, Sandy wades through blazing infernos and demented looters in a desperate attempt to save her family. Finally, with the fate of the world in the balance, both captains must take the battle to the enemy--humanity's very survival hanging on their success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Mike Ortego\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab532687219249e1524342b92a4695e97313ac4d","amp;dn":"Dean+M.+Cole+-+Ambush+%28Sector+64+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab532687219249e1524342b92a4695e97313ac4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,83,38,135,33,146,73,225,82,67,66,185,42,70,149,233,115,19,172,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
