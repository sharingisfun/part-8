Leaving Tomorrow\n\n  Onwards to the Wall, the EP A Place to Bury Strangers issued between this album and Exploding Head, suggested the band was headed in a harder-edged, more streamlined direction that felt all the more radical given their previous full-length's wind tunnel dream pop. However, it isn't that easy to sum up where the band is going on Worship, and that's a big part of what makes these some of their finest and most interesting songs. A Place to Bury Strangers delivers on Onwards to the Wall's retro-futuristic grind -- which was as comfortable with Suicide's electro-punk as it was with My Bloody Valentine's wide guitar swaths -- particularly on &quot;You Are the One,&quot; which builds from sleek beats into off-the-rails guitar explosions as it conflates love with collisions.  In some ways, it's hard to believe that this is only A Place to Bury Strangers' third album; they've grown so sophisticated -- while remaining true to their basic sound -- that it seems like it should have taken them longer to get where they are on Worship, an album that's just as vital as it is accomplished.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e57af19b706841236924d5832f5685af86073ad","amp;dn":"A+Place+to+Bury+Strangers+-+Worship+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e57af19b706841236924d5832f5685af86073ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,87,175,25,183,6,132,18,54,146,77,88,50,245,104,90,248,96,115,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
