Room Service\n          02. Two Timer\n          03. Ladies In Waiting\n          04. Getaway\n          05. Rock Bottom\n          06. C'mon And Love Me\n          07.

I recorded from a Marantz Gold Series turntable with diamond stylus, through a Roland CPM-120 amplifier (with cardioid capabilities) into a Fostex FD-8 (24-bit@48kHz). Initially, I remastered the material to CD from the Fostex, giving it analogue-style equalisation (in a digital environment).\n\nRecently, I ran the material off disc, through Sound Forge Pro version 10. I was able to clean it up further, doing tops and tails (the songs begin and end right on the money), removed pops and crackle, equalised it a bit further using Sony Xpress Graphic EQ (this sured up low bass and ultra trebles). Finally, I ran it through Nomad BluesTube Brickwall with a custom 'master mix leveller' that amplified and levelled to -0.4dB.\n\nI know it's a big folder, but for anyone who loves KISS, FLAC versions of albums or even just great audio remastered from vinyl, this is premium stuff. Final files are FLAC 24bit@96kHz.\n\nI've compared it to the FLAC version from CD (which I also have) and I find this remaster has more dynamics, psychoacoustics and is a lot warmer than the CD. I think I can safely delete the CDrip from my hard drive now!\n\nCheers,\nMoofieMan.\n\n\nThanks to all who seed - you are the lifeblood of the system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caae4830815a057b91fbfab8e044e5b18d323483","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Dressed+To+Kill+%281975%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caae4830815a057b91fbfab8e044e5b18d323483","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,174,72,48,129,90,5,123,145,251,250,184,224,68,229,177,141,50,52,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
