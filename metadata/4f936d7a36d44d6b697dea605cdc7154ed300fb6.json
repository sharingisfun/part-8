It's small, requiring careful focus and composition, and it's usually shiny, requiring attention to detail in lighting. In this course, photographer Konrad Eek details the creative and technical decisions involved in making jewelry look its best. The course begins with an overview of backgrounds and lighting techniques, including details on how to build an inexpensive chamber that creates beautiful, diffused light.\n\nThe course then demonstrates several shooting scenarios, including a ring, a wristwatch, and a necklace and earring set. Each scenario explores a different lighting tool, from inexpensive flash to larger studio strobes to continuous lights.
