The straightforwardly named Archive 2003-2006 captures the attempts Department of Eagles made over those years to make the follow-up to The Cold Nose (aka The Whitey on the Moon LP). Despite the scattered nature of the recording sessions and the varying states of completion these songs are in, Rossen and Nicolaus found ways to make this more than just a slapped-together collection of odds and sods. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Practice Room SketchesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- ghostly traces of a piano melody here, a skeletal song there -- link together the more fleshed-out tracks and add an open-ended wistfulness to the whole affair. Surprisingly though, most of ArchiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songs are closer to finished than not, and several of them rival the tracks that made it onto Department of EaglesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ official albums. Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“While WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re YoungÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s brisk, symphonic folk-pop have just as much hooky flair as Ã¢â‚¬Å“No One Does It Like YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; meanwhile, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Golden AppleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s slowly unfolding space lullaby is so unique that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the full Department of Eagles treatment. However, the band did recycle parts of these songs into other tracks: the banjo melody from the pretty but somewhat disjointed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Deadly DisclosureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ended up on the In Ear Park song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Balmy Night.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As always, the Grizzly Bear comparisons are inevitable, but Archive falls closer to Yellow HouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rustic experiments than to VeckatimestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multifaceted dazzle (which makes sense, since Rossen joined the band in 2004, right in the middle of these sessions). Though songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grand Army PlazaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brightest MindsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ -- both of which are great examples of Department of EaglesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ oddly nostalgic sound -- fell by the wayside, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re too good not to be heard. Archive 2003-2006 is well worth a listen for Department of Eagles and Grizzly Bear fans, especially those intrigued by how albums get made -- or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get made, as the case may be..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca62afe8818d17bcf2b28f4c7bc43d8949a6d31","amp;dn":"Department+of+Eagles+-+Archive+2003+-+2006+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca62afe8818d17bcf2b28f4c7bc43d8949a6d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,166,42,254,136,24,209,123,207,43,40,244,199,188,67,216,148,154,109,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
