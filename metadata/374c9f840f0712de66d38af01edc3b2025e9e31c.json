Updating the content to match todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landscape of game engine architecture, this second edition continues to thoroughly cover the major components that make up a typical commercial game engine.\n\nNew to the Second Edition\n\nInformation on new topics, including the latest variant of the C++ programming language, C++11, and the architecture of the eighth generation of gaming consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4\nNew chapter on audio technology covering the fundamentals of the physics, mathematics, and technology that go into creating an AAA game audio engine\nUpdated sections on multicore programming, pipelined CPU architecture and optimization, localization, pseudovectors and Grassman algebra, dual quaternions, SIMD vector math, memory alignment, and anti-aliasing\nInsight into the making of Naughty DogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest hit, The Last of Us\nThe book presents the theory underlying various subsystems that comprise a commercial game engine as well as the data structures, algorithms, and software interfaces that are typically used to implement them. It primarily focuses on the engine itself, including a host of low-level foundation systems, the rendering engine, the collision system, the physics simulation, character animation, and audio. An in-depth discussion on the &quot;gameplay foundation layer&quot; delves into the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s object model, world editor, event system, and scripting system. The text also touches on some aspects of gameplay programming, including player mechanics, cameras, and AI.\n\nAn awareness-building tool and a jumping-off point for further learning, Game Engine Architecture, Second Edition gives readers a solid understanding of both the theory and common practices employed within each of the engineering disciplines covered. The book will help readers on their journey through this fascinating and multifaceted field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374c9f840f0712de66d38af01edc3b2025e9e31c","amp;dn":"Game+Engine+Architecture%2C+Second+Edition+Jason+Gregory.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374c9f840f0712de66d38af01edc3b2025e9e31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,76,159,132,15,7,18,222,102,211,138,240,30,220,59,32,37,233,227,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
