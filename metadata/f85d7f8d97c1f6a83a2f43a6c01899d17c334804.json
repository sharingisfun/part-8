You'd think the distinctive quavering voice was created to sing that one song. The former Undertones frontman has a shot at songwriting with producer David A. Stewart, but wisely borrows numbers by Chrissie Hynde, Benmont Tench, and the Womack brothers. Veteran Eurythmics producer and guitarist Stewart and arranger Michael Kamen provide a fitting R&amp;B backdrop for the headliner, who would not reach these heights again.
