To the herd's surprise, the child born from the stray egg is a Tyrannosaurus. Determined to not leave the newborn behind, the mother abandons the pack and raises her two kids by herself. Named Heart by his adoptive mother, the Tyrannosaurus grows up besides his Maiasaura brother, Light. Soon enough the siblings discover why Heart is unlike the others and the difference between meat-eaters and plant-eaters. Heart then makes a tough decision and leaves his family behind to discover who he really is. By a twist of fate, Heart stumbles upon the hatching egg of an Ankylosaurus and finds himself taking care of this plant-eating little one.\n\nGreat movie.
