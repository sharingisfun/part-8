There is a lot of checking on game namings, matching, making sure\nnothing is missing and adding extra games that might be missing. When this project began many consoles had missing covers,\nmissing videos, missing wheelart and so on. And many consoles had not even been incorporated into Hyperspin. I wanted\neverything in my setup, and no games missing (from what can currently be emulated) or holes.\n\nThe point of this project was to collect everything avalible, match everything and create content that was missing. This\nhas resulted in lots of work for hunting down extra games, recording a lot of gameplay videos, collecting covers and so on. Not\nto mention creating themes for the main menu. About nine months later everything is in place and I'd go as far as to consider it\nthe most complete setup out there.\nMAME\nAtari 2600 (+prototypes and extra games added)\nAtari 5200\nAtari 7800\nAtari Jaguar\nAtari Lynx\nFamicom Disk System\nNintendo Entertainment System (+prototypes and extra games added)\nSuper Nintendo Entertainment System (+prototypes and extra games added)\nNintendo 64\nGameboy\nGameboy Color\nGameboy Advance\nVirtual Boy\nSega SG1000\nSega Master System\nSega Genesis (+best of japanese games added)\nSega CD (+best of japanese games added)\nSega 32X\nSega Saturn (+best of japanese games added)\nSega Dreamcast (+best of japanese games added)\nSega Game Gear\nPC Engine\nTurboGrafx 16\nTurboGrafx CD\nSuperGrafx\nPCFX\nNeo Geo AES\nNeo Geo CD\nNeo Geo Pocket\nNeo Geo Pocket Color\nPanasonic 3DO\nSony Playstation (+best of japanese games added)\nRCA Studio II\nChannel F\nAstrocade\nGCE Vectrex\nArcadia 2001\nMagnavox Odyssey 2\nGX4000\nActionmax\nCreativision\nAdventurevision\nIntellivision\nColecovision\nSupervision\nWonderswan Mono\nWonderswan Color\nCommodore Amiga\nPop Cap\nDICE\nAAE\nNintendo Arcade Systems\nDaphne\nNeo Geo Arcade\nSega Model 2\nZinc\nFuture Pinball\nNot complete means that the games in the torrent aren't complete, but all games in the frontend have all material\nand thus they look complete still. Mame for example still hasn't wheels created for all games, it's an ongoing project\nover at HyperSpin. HyperSpin is set to only show games with wheels in order to make the wheel look clean, so when new\nwheels are created just grab them over at HS and the games will appear in the frontend.\n\nthanks to piratko\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435aa6ba95f0e298406b6e9b424a614a0c7cc742","amp;dn":"Hyperspin+Project+-+Atari+And+Nec+Systems+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435aa6ba95f0e298406b6e9b424a614a0c7cc742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,90,166,186,149,240,226,152,64,107,110,155,66,74,97,74,12,124,199,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
