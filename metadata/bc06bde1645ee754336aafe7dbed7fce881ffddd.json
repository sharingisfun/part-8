Glaser's manifold accomplishments, exhibiting a vast array of styles and approaches, include the &quot;I [Heart] NY&quot; campaign, the multicolored menus at the Rainbow Room, and the now-iconic album covers by Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone, Lightnin' Hopkins, and many other artists, and literally scores of other accomplishments -- making him not only synonymous with graphic design in the U.S., but a veritable godfather of pop-culture publicity. As helmed by neophyte director Wendy Keys, Milton Glaser: To Inform and Delight introduces audiences to the legendary creator, with glimpses of his exhaustive portfolio, and candid discussions revealing his intelligence, insight, sense of humor, and boundless creative spirit. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc06bde1645ee754336aafe7dbed7fce881ffddd","amp;dn":"Milton+Glaser+To+Inform+and+Delight+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc06bde1645ee754336aafe7dbed7fce881ffddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,6,189,225,100,94,231,84,51,106,175,231,219,237,127,206,136,31,253,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
