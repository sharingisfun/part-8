Comprising six twenty-five minute episodes, the two linked three-part stories tell the adventures of three teenagers and their battle to save their school and their classmates from the actions of the sinister Mr Eldritch. It was the first television drama to be written by Russell T Davies, and is also noteworthy for co-starring a young Kate Winslet in her first major television role.\n\nThe first three episodes begin with Third Year secondary school girl Marcie and her two Fifth Year friends Tom and Reet becoming suspicious of the sinister Mr Eldritch, whose computer company arrives at the school and distributes free computers to all the pupils.\n\nWith the reluctant help of their teacher Miss Maitland they apparently defeat the threat of Eldritch, who disappears. However, the second three episodes tell of the actions of Miss Pendragon, who works for Eldritch and is attempting to revive the massive, secret Behemoth computer from its long-hidden location beneath the school.\n\nAt the end of the BBC novelization, there are indications that Davies had ideas or interest in a potential third adventure using the same characters. A single paragraph describing the opening of an amusement arcade concludes with &quot;...but that's another story.\n\nThis series has a lot in common with the doctor who series so enjoy ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5ea687459dfb5908c5b5e3e38f8ef5aa5ad4d89","amp;dn":"Dark+Season++Russel+T+Davies+1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5ea687459dfb5908c5b5e3e38f8ef5aa5ad4d89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,234,104,116,89,223,181,144,140,91,94,62,56,248,239,90,165,173,77,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
