As the mystery of &quot;Who Killed Laura Palmer?&quot; played out on television sets across the world, another compelling drama was unfolding in the everyday lives of the show's cast and crew. Twenty-five years later, Reflections goes behind the curtain of Twin Peaks and documents the series' unlikely beginnings, widespread success, and peculiar collapse. Featuring first-hand accounts from series cocreator Mark Frost and cast members including Kyle MacLachlan, Madchen Amick, Richard Beymer, Joan Chen, Sherilyn Fenn, Miguel Ferrer, Piper Laurie, Sheryl Lee, Michael Ontkean, Ray Wise, Billy Zane, and many more - Reflections explores the magic and mystique of a true television phenomenon, Twin Peaks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa47dedba3f334cdaf041d9ef943b787fd6c37f","amp;dn":"+Reflections%3A+An+Oral+History+of+Twin+Peaks+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa47dedba3f334cdaf041d9ef943b787fd6c37f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,164,125,237,186,63,51,76,218,240,65,217,239,148,59,120,127,214,195,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
