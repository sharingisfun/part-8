The gulf between the Gallipoli campaign and the theatre of modern war may span a century, but the struggle to find the truth in war reportage, often skewed by propaganda, mythmaking and censorship, remains as challenging today as it was in 1915.\n\nThe documentary explores the drama producersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ decision to tell a well-known story from a new angle. Theirs is the point of view of the four journalists: Charles Bean, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, Phillip Schuler and Keith Murdoch who find themselves unable to report the truth they bear witness to. Though they understand that truth may sometimes be a casualty of war, the futility and carnage starts to weigh heavily on them. Two of them mount an offensive of their own with extraordinary results. These are the first truly embedded war correspondents whose actions and defiance ignite a change in the campaignÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s course and whose commitment to the stories of fighting men turn Gallipoli from a strategic failure into legend.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 25-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f6ec7b4ebee8db61c7035a0d7e3dc8e2aac9d9","amp;dn":"Deadline.Gallipoli.The.Full.Story.HDTV.x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f6ec7b4ebee8db61c7035a0d7e3dc8e2aac9d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,246,236,123,78,190,232,219,97,199,3,90,13,126,61,200,226,170,201,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
