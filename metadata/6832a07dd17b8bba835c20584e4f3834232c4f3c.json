The series was Andy Richter's first starring role after leaving Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2000. The series' plots were fairly typical of sitcoms with Andy getting himself into a situation and having to find a solution. The unique aspects were several unusual devices that defined the show. First was Richter's voiceover which essentially narrated the plot, as well as Andy's thought processes in each episode. Secondly, and connected to the first was Andy's imagination, which was presented onscreen as if it were reality until it was revealed in a smash cut accompanied by the sound of rewinding audio tape. This is often used to demonstrate alternatives to what actually happened for a given event. A theme of the show which uses these techniques was its original working title, Anything Can Happen; a thought which Richter imparts to the audience in the narration of the opening teaser of the series premiere.\n\nDescription (Andy Barker, PI): Andy Barker, P.I. was a short-lived American detective sitcom starring Andy Richter produced and broadcast by NBC, and co-starring Tony Hale, Marshall Manesh, Harve Presnell and Clea Lewis Richter plays Andy Barker, a certified public accountant who reluctantly becomes a private investigator after he is mistaken for the former office tenant, a private eye, now retired. Andy develops a taste for solving cases, assisted by the former P.I, a film buff owner of the downstairs video store, a surveillance-expert restaurateur and, as time goes on, his wife. The show was produced for one season, and was scheduled to run a six-episode, five-week course starting Thursday, March 15, 2007 on NBC[1]. However, the series was cancelled and removed from the Thursday lineup after the fourth episode aired. The final two episodes aired on Saturday, April 14.[2]. The series now airs on Universal HD.\n\nCreators: Jonathan Groff, Conan O'Brien, Victor Fresco.\nWriters: Jonathan Groff, Conan O'Brien, Victor Fresco, Michael A.
