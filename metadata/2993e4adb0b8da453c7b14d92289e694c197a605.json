Shooter is his harrowing first-person account of a sniper's life on and off the modern battlefield.\nGunnery Sgt. Jack Coughlin is a divorced father of two who grew up in a wealthy Boston suburb. At the age of nineteen, although he had never even held a gun, he joined the Marines and would spend the next twenty years behind the scope of a long-range precision rifle as a sniper.\nIn that time he accumulated one of the most successful sniper records in the Corps, ranging through many of the world's hotspots. During Operation Iraqi Freedom alone, he recorded at least thirty-six kills, thirteen of them in a single twenty-four-hour period.\nNow Coughlin has written a highly personal story about his deadly craft, taking readers deep inside an invisible society that is off-limits to outsiders. This is not a heroic battlefield memoir, but the careful study of an exceptional man who must keep his sanity while carrying forward one of the deadliest legacies in the U.S. military today.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2993e4adb0b8da453c7b14d92289e694c197a605","amp;dn":"Shooter+Autobiography+of+the+Top-Ranked+Sniper+by+Jack+Coughlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2993e4adb0b8da453c7b14d92289e694c197a605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,147,228,173,176,184,218,69,60,123,20,217,34,137,230,148,193,151,166,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
