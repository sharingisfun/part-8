As always, Chomsky presents his ideas vividly and accessibly, with uncompromising principle and clarifying insight.\n\nThe latest volume from a long-established, trusted partnership, this collection shows once again that no interlocutor engages with Chomsky more effectively than David Barsamian. These interviews will inspire a new generation of readers, as well as longtime Chomsky fans eager for his latest thinking on the many crises we now confront, both at home and abroad. They confirm that Chomsky is an unparalleled resource for anyone seeking to understand our world today.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f294bc08c295e172a4c604dd7e9fd9ea520efa","amp;dn":"Power+Systems+by+Noam+Chomsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f294bc08c295e172a4c604dd7e9fd9ea520efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,242,148,188,8,194,149,225,114,164,198,4,221,126,159,217,234,82,14,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
