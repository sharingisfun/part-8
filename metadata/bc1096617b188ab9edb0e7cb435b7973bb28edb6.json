With Alice Cooper \r\nas opening act on the equival rights. Reported that due to Jimmy Page's illness the band \r\neliminated their 2nd set from this show. \r\n\r\nWe can certainly feel that the performance of the band captured by the tape is one of its \r\nearliest, since most of the tunes are played in more compact manner than they became in \r\nlater stages. Here, improvisations are confined to minimum levels. However, the brutality \r\nof Bonzo's drum playing and the wide range of Robert's voice is incredible. Jimmy also \r\nseems to have been doing some experimental guitar works here. For Your Love rounds out \r\nthis performance and the band play it as it should have been originally. It doesnâ€™t get \r\nmore psychedelic than this version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1096617b188ab9edb0e7cb435b7973bb28edb6","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1969.01.05+Los+Angeles%2C+whisky+a+go+go+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1096617b188ab9edb0e7cb435b7973bb28edb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,16,150,97,123,24,138,185,237,176,231,203,67,91,121,115,187,40,237,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
