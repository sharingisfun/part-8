King David (Gregory Peck), much beloved by his subjects and a war hero of long standing, falls victim to the sins of the flesh when he falls in love with Bathsheba (Susan Hayward), the wife of Uriah (Kieron Moore), one of David's most trusted soldiers. His downfall begins when David orders Uriah into a suicidal battle, knowing that this will clear the way for his relationship with Bathsheba. His infatuation leads him to neglect his kingdom and his people, and invokes the wrath of God. Only after his land has been devastated by God's hand does David offer atonement. The film's lavish production values compensate ever so slightly for the long-winded script. David and Bathsheba was the last major &quot;flat-screen&quot; Biblical epic; it was filmed in 1951 B.C. -- Before Cinemascope. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043455/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043455/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-43455/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-43455/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nHenry King\n\n        Gregory Peck\t ... \tKing David\n\n\tSusan Hayward\t... \tBathsheba\n\tRaymond Massey\t... \tNathan\n\tKieron Moore\t... \tUriah\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:55:41\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x544 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 2044 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:543f639a4d75a2876ecf5b1974c8ab2833ce3a06","amp;dn":"David+and+Bathsheba+%281951%29+Gregory+Peck+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"543f639a4d75a2876ecf5b1974c8ab2833ce3a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,63,99,154,77,117,162,135,110,207,91,25,116,200,171,40,51,206,58,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
