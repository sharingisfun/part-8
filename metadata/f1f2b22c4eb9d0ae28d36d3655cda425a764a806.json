No problem. Playing polo with a headless goat? Easy. Getting kicked out of Gansu province by the Chinese government? All in a day's work. Climbing a five-storey sword ladder? Now, that may be pushing it for Peter and Jeff Hutchens, the 20-something filmmaker/photographer duo in this new six-part series. Peter and Jeff go back to China, where they lived as children, to document the nation in the midst of social reinvention. Whether it's a round of pick-up basketball with Tibetan herdsmen, a synthesized dance party outside traditional Kyrgyz yurts or a mobile phone-wielding camel guide in the desert, the boys uniquely capture the old China blending in with the new.\n\n\n1)  Silk Road \nJeff and Peter Hutchens begin their China journey in Chinas westernmost province, Xingjiang. Populated by locals known as Uyghars, the brothers try to learn the ways of these rough people. They begin their journey in the city of Kashgar. Located near the only passes through the nearly impassible Pamir mountains, Kashgar was the last stop before starting out on the &quot;the Silk Road&quot; to western markets. In Kashgar, they barter for hats in the market, obtain a Uyghar knive, attend a cock-fight, celebrate the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, and even eat goats head! On the Silk Road, the brothers buy silks, hunt for precious white jade, ride a camel caravan through the desert, and play a version of polo with a goats head. Theyll do all of this to understand the traditional and modern way of life of the Uyghar people.\n\n2)  Three Gorges Dam \nIn this episode, the Hutchens Brothers take a journey on the world's third longest river, the Yangtze. Peter and Jeff grew up near the Yangtze as boys and now they are returning to this part of the river known as the Three Gorges to get one last look before this land that inspired poets and artists for centuries is consumed by the rising waters. The Chinese government is building the world's biggest dam on the Yangtze in this region. It will displace millions of people from theirs homes and a way of life they have always known.\n\n3)  Ice City \nThe boys were at Harbin and visited the Ice Festival and a theme park where an ice Buddha, ice Westminster Abbey and an ice Acropolis are on display. Peter and Jeff, try their hand at ice sculpting and ice swimming before warming up with a few shots of vodka at a local bar made entirely from ice.\n\n4)  Going Local \nIn this episode, Peter and Jeff Hutchins visit the Chinese province of Yunnan. Yunnan is province with largest diversity in all of China. There are 25 different minorities in this province. To learn about these different minorities, the brothers visit the National Ethnic Minorities Park. The brothers soon discover that to really understand the cultures of these people, they will need to visit them in their native villages. Pete and Jeff attend a Lisu festival that includes an 11 story sword ladder and walking on hot coals! Peter decides to take a shaky ride on an old-fashioned Ferris wheel and they join in on a traditional crossbow competition. Then they take a zip line over a steep gorge to a Lisu village.\n\n5)  Gansu \nIn this episode, Peter and Jeff Hutchins visit with the Buddhist monks of China. Buddhism was once the predominant religion of China. Now the brothers will explore the traditions of the Buddhist monks. In Ganzu, they will be the first westerners to film in the Gansu province\n\n6)  Beijing Boom \nPeter and Jeff visit China's capital, Beijing, where they join a punk band and play ping-pong with members of the Communist Youth League.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2838/lostinchinascreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2838/lostinchinascreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/7010/lostinchinascreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/7010/lostinchinascreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2711/lostinchinascreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2711/lostinchinascreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8056/lostinchinascreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8056/lostinchinascreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/747/lostinchinascreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/747/lostinchinascreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8446/lostinchinascreen5i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8446/lostinchinascreen5i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/430/lostinchinascreen6t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/430/lostinchinascreen6t.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8128/lostinchinascreen7y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8128/lostinchinascreen7y.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/5125/lostinchinascreen8w.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/5125/lostinchinascreen8w.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4742/lostinchinascreen9t.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4742/lostinchinascreen9t.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/9977/lostinchinascreen10a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/9977/lostinchinascreen10a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8796/lostinchinascreen11m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/8796/lostinchinascreen11m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1883 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25FPS\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2ch\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime per Part 48.mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f2b22c4eb9d0ae28d36d3655cda425a764a806","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Lost+in+China+4of6+Going+Local+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f2b22c4eb9d0ae28d36d3655cda425a764a806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,242,178,44,78,185,208,174,40,211,109,54,85,205,164,37,167,100,168,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
