Keynote is a popular choice. Though it's streamlined and easy to use (like a lot of Apple products), we could all use a hand building our first Keynote slideshow. In this course, David Rivers teaches how to use Keynote to its full potential, and create presentations that both entertain and inform. Learn how to choose slide layouts; add text, images, audio and video, animation, and eye-catching effects; use transitions to ease the moves between slides; and get set up to deliver a smooth presentation. Plus, learn how to share your presentation as a movie, a PDF, a printout, or even on iCloud.\nNote: This training applies to Keynote 2014, which comes with OS X Mavericks. You may not be able to open the exercise files for this course in earlier versions of Keynote.\n\nTopics include:\n* Working with themes\n* Editing master slides\n* Adding text, shapes, and links\n* Building tables and interactive charts\n* Inserting audio and video in your slides\n* Applying transitions\n* Playing a slideshow\n* Recording narration\n* Sharing and exporting presentations ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babd97287e916417130d5f4f127020f807cc7cbe","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Keynote+6+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babd97287e916417130d5f4f127020f807cc7cbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,189,151,40,126,145,100,23,19,13,95,79,18,112,32,248,7,204,124,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
