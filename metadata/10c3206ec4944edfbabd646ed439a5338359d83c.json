As their only authorized biographer, he had unparalleled accessÃ¢â‚¬â€not just to John, Paul, George, and Ringo but also to friends, family, and colleagues. Davies collected a wealth of intimate and revealing material that still makes this the classic Beatles bookÃ¢â‚¬â€the one all other biographers look to. He remained close with the band and had access to more information over the years. This edition brings the story up-to-date with new material on the Beatles's solo careers and lives, as well as the stories of many other people who appear in the book. Drawing on new material from the author's archives and from the Beatles themselves, including a newly discovered song lyric by George Harrison, this edition brings new insights to the Beatles legend. 69 black-and-white photographs.\n\nPublisher: W.

Their inestimable number of fans have not been willing to let it be, and the release of the three Anthology double CD sets has put the group right back on top. amazingly, their recordings sell more copies now than at the height of Beatlemania. Written in 1968, this was the only official portrait of the group that was produced with their cooperation. For this revision, Davies has included a new introduction and three updated appendixes of Beatles places, memorabilia, and books. Though works on the band are legion, this remains one of the best.\n\nMost Helpful Customer Reviews\n\nVital source\nBy kennedy19 on September 6, 2000\nThank heaven for Beatle scholarship that this book was written. Competent journalist Hunter Davies spent a year observing the Beatles and interviewing them in their own homes during the heady, fascinating year of 1967. He emerged with a time piece: the Beatles as they were at that time, reflecting on what came before and unaware of what was yet to come. A chapter describing the writing and recording of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends,&quot; &quot;Getting Better,&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; offers unique and especially valuable glimpses of the Beatles at work. Chapters depicting the home life and personal outlook of each Beatle are also very interesting. I must also say that for an authorised biography, this is remarkably honest. Perceptive readers will be able to detect the whole truth here, and a fine introduction written by the author years later helps fill in any gaps. Apart from being hugely entertaining, this book is a tremendous boon to historians interested in the Beatles.\n\n\nThe Beatles as we loved them\nBy A Customer on May 30, 2000\nThis is a fabulous evocation of the fab four's rise to greatness, written with just the right amount of reverence and objectivity. Davies manages to ellicit some great anecdotes from people who were closest to The Beatles. Mimi, Paul's dad, the Harrisons, close friends, Fred Lennon (John's dad), Pete Best; they all get to have their say. The book is especially strong during the Hamburg years (loosely 59-62). Davies captures the growth in their popularity, attracting interesting characters along the way, yet having no fan base outside Liverpool and Hamburg. He demonstrates so vividly the growing desperation of the boys to make it big. Once the rollercoaster took off then the book is on trickier ground. Davies clearly wants to divulge stuff which The Beatles were not keen on him revealing (Davies was writing the book during 1967/early 68). For instance, Lennon was heavily into drugs at this time and Hunter Davies refers to John as being in a daze. Yes, you have to read between the lines! One of the strengths of this book is its matter-of-fact delivery. Although Davies is clearly a fan he still keeps his feet on the ground. The death of Brian Epstein is well-handled. Remember, this was written before all the Klein, Apple, Ono nonsense hit the fan. Yet Davies manages to convey a growing sense of isolation amongst the group. His pen-portraits of each member is uncannily (eerily) accurate, bearing in mind the general public thought The Beatles were a rock-solid national institution. The book is a cracker and loses a star of its rating only because of a rather mysterious lack of detail around Rubber Soul and Revolver. The rest is gear!\n\n\nFrozen in time, it offers a one-of-a-kind perspective\nBy Mark Wolf on February 18, 2004\nI read this book with great enthusiasm. Its age gives it a unique and fascinating historical perspective. John and Cynthia were still married, Apple was a brand new venture, the Apple Boutique was still in business, &quot;Magic&quot; Alex was still an &quot;electronics expert,&quot; Jane Asher had not yet consigned the early Lennon-McCartney notebooks to the trash, and Brian Epstein was still in the closet. The narrative is obviously sanatized, but it also contains interviews with Aunt Mimi and Fred Lennon and others. At times it reads like a well-researched term paper, but the frozen-in-time point of view gave it a special charm that any fan will enjoy and appreciate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c3206ec4944edfbabd646ed439a5338359d83c","amp;dn":"%5BHunter+Davies%5D+The+Beatles%28Updated+Edition%29%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c3206ec4944edfbabd646ed439a5338359d83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,195,32,110,196,148,78,223,186,189,100,110,212,57,165,51,131,89,216,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
