Beneath its epic sweep, gorgeous language, and haunting details is the most elemental, and eternal, of narratives: that of the necessities and perils of self-reinvention, and the sorrow and giddiness of aspiring to a life of artistic transcendance.â€\r\nâ€“Hanya Yanagihara, author of A Little Life and People In The Trees\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Queen of the Night is a luminous universe into which its lucky readers can dissolve completely, metamorphosing alongside its shapeshifting protagonist. Lilliet Berne steals her name from a gravestone and launches into a life of full-throated song; her voice is an intoxicant, and this book is a glorious performance. Cheeâ€™s enveloping, seductive prose is perfectly matched to the circus world of the opera.â€\r\nâ€“Karen Russell, New York Times Best Selling author of Swamplandia! and Vampires In The Lemon Grove\r\n\r\nâ€œAlexander Chee packs his extraordinary second novel, The Queen of the Night, to the seams with music, love, misery, and secrets. The kind of bookâ€”worldâ€”charactersâ€”you could live inside, happily, for days and days and never once want to come up for air.â€\r\nâ€“Kelly Link, author of Get In Trouble and Magic For Beginners\r\n\r\nâ€œA mesmerizing tale of power and passion. Chee gives us an unforgettable heroine and a rich cast of charactersâ€”many of them real historical figures. The story dazzles and surprises right up until the final page.â€\r\nâ€“J. Courtney Sullivan, New York Times Best-Selling author of Maine and The Engagements\r\n\r\nâ€œRichly researched, ornately plotted, this story demands, and repays, close attention.â€\r\nâ€“Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review\r\n\r\nâ€œCheeâ€™s lush and sweeping second novel uses a strikingly different setting from his accomplished debut, Edinburgh, but shares its musical themes and boldnessâ€¦ a moving meditation on the transformative power of fate, art, time, and sheer survival.â€\r\nâ€“Publishersâ€™ Weekly\r\n\r\nWhen renowned soprano Lilliet Berne, the toast of Belle Epoque Paris, is offered the role of a lifetime in an original opera, she is shocked to realize that the libretto seems to be based on her own life. After reinventing herself and carefully shrouding the secrets of her early years, she believed she had moved away from the scandal, shame, and intrigue of her youth forever. Reaching back into time, she recalls her Minnesota childhood, her escape to Paris, her adventures as a hippodrome rider, her career as a courtesan, her stint as a spy, and her meteoric rise through the cutthroat ranks of the opera world. In order to unravel the mystery of who has betrayed her, she reviews her entire entangled history, recalling the twists and turns of her own life as well as the sweeping history of an era along the way. Peppering the unfolding plot with real-life events and figures, Chee provides a suitably operatic backdrop for the mesmerizing novel.\r\nâ€“Booklist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49953b95289503af588a07666d5e54c9dc0193f0","amp;dn":"The+Queen+of+the+Night+-+Alexander+Chee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49953b95289503af588a07666d5e54c9dc0193f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,149,59,149,40,149,3,175,88,138,7,102,109,94,84,201,220,1,147,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
