What was the original title of 1984? When did cigarettes first appear in English literature? And, while weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at it, who wrote the first Western, and is there any link between asthma and literary genius?\n\nSutherlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s irreverent literary exploration illuminates every topic imaginable from author advances to Civil War literature to Victorian sex to odd things eaten by literary characters (think Patrick BatemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend in American Psycho). This is a treasure trove of fascinating information for all book lovers.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nAuthor and literature professor Sutherland collects a sundry list of literary fact and trivia into a chaotic assortment of narratives. Organized under a stream-of-consciousness list of themes (&quot;Literary Baked Meats,&quot; &quot;Better Than Sex, Some Say,&quot; &quot;Mammon and the Book Trade&quot;), Sutherland has set few boundaries for himself regarding subject matter: irritable bowel syndrome, the wedding night, and Rose of Sharon's absurdly generous gift in the conclusion of The Grapes of Wrath all come into play. Though he might be self-indulgent, Sutherland delves into the minutiae with grace and good British wit, bringing humor and appeal to even the most (seemingly) dull subjects. Average readers don't need to worry about comparative illiteracy; Sutherland is so thorough that prior knowledge isn't necessary. A lively read for anyone who wants to learn more about their favorite classics, and a lively cheat sheet for those who want to impress their friends in the lit crowd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c44fb5dd056771820d19e29fd47b44480f34c85","amp;dn":"Curiosities+of+Literature+-+John+Sutherland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c44fb5dd056771820d19e29fd47b44480f34c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,68,251,93,208,86,119,24,32,209,158,41,253,71,180,68,128,243,76,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
