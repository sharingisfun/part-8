This trend has become immensely influential, as it helps us to disclose the tacit assumptions underlying the exercise of political power. But, as a result, the understanding of government itself has fallen behind.\n\nThis Companion offers a modern, comprehensive volume on Greek government, detailing the variety of constitutions and types of governing bodies in the Greek world. It constitutes an all-new standard reference work, with an overall focus on institutions and state action, while also addressing, through individual contributions, recent scholarship on ancient Greek political culture.\n\nThe book covers the wide range of governmental action in Greek antiquity. It explores the multiple manifestations of state action throughout the Greek world. It considers a broad selection of city-states, and governmental realms beyond the polis.\n\nThis comprehensive volume details the variety of constitutions and types of governing bodies in the ancient Greek world.\n\n* A collection of original scholarship on ancient Greek governing structures and institutions\n* Explores the multiple manifestations of state action throughout the Greek world\n* Discusses the evolution of government from the Archaic Age to the Hellenistic period, ancient typologies of government, its various branches, principles and procedures and realms of governance\n* Creates a unique synthesis on the spatial and memorial connotations of government by combining the latest institutional research with more recent trends in cultural scholarship\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHans Beck is Professor of Ancient History, John MacNaughton Chair of Classics and Director of Classical Studies at McGill University in Montreal.
