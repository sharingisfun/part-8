With this album, Impaled Nazarene does not pull any punches. Right from the moment your finger presses play your face is repeatedly assaulted with burning black metal until it completely melts off at the end and leaves you an unrecognizable lump. There are no spooky interludes or atmospheric ditties; just punishing black metal in its purest form. Frankly, you could pick any track on here and have your ears assaulted with the same ferocity and intensity as the next, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll highlight a few to drive the point home. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Flaming Sword of SatanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ utterly kills with its stomping, chugging, axes swinging rhythm while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Martial LawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vestal VirginsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bulldoze you with fast paced punk rhythms and snarling swagger. The rest of the album follows suit, with everything being fast paced, with constant double bass and blastbeats fronted by LuttinenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s snarled screams. I know that Impaled Nazarene have attempted to distance themselves from the black metal scene of late, but Vigorous and Liberating Death is truly a black metal album.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis album is blasting, blistering and unholy, but it has its share of missteps. First off, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pathological Hunger for ViolenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows the guitarists messing with wanky solos that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit in with the maniacal pacing and driving rhythms. I know itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nitpicky qualm, but man those goofy solos just made me completely lose my focus every time I heard them. Obviously the band knows how to incorporate leads with their brand of black metal, as evidenced during Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dystopia A.S.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which shows the leads flowing with the rest of the music rather than starkly opposing it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Martial LawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ also slides off with an out of place bass break, which starts out cool enough but just winds up with a head scratching moment. The artwork does herald the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier albums, especially Tol Cormpt Norz Norz NorzÃ¢â‚¬Â¦, with its twisted, evil design, but how the hell did the skeletons manage to keep certain appendages which are primarily made of tissue and blood vessels when the rest of their have bodies rotted away? Another one of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mysteries, I guess.\n\nVigorous and Liberating Death is a worthy addition to the Impaled Nazarene discography. If you dig any of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier material, then surely you will find this album to your liking. The production is meaty and allows the blistering material to shine through. I have to give props to Mika Luttinen for his unwavering approach to black metal that has endured this long. While this is a great example of punk-infused, blasting, blistering, no hold barred black metal, the same could be said for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entire discography. This blatantly bowls over a large majority of black metal in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scene and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive that LuttinenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formula is just as potent today as it was in 1990. So Vigorous and Liberating Death is a good album as far as Impaled Nazarene albums go, but the same could be said for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other eleven albums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCurrent Members:\n\n\n  - Slutti666: Vocals (1990-present)\n\n  - Repe Misanthrope: Drums (1995-present)\n\n  - Arc v 666: Bass (2000-present)\n\n  - Tomi UG Ullgren: Guitars (2007-present)\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n   \n   1.
