Another contributing factor to the size of this torrent has to do with the extremely large bonus [deleted or remastered cutscene] video clips I added for your enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThis is an artistically edited, feature-length movie of the 2003 video-game Silent Hill 3 in full 720p High Definition. And no, it's not just some let's player dicking around and calling it a movie.\r\n\r\nRun time is approximately 121 minutes and 30 seconds, but there's 30 minutes of cut clips (trimmed for time) and a few remastered scenes from the game included! It is in 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen) and is in 720p High Definition. It's is in MP4 format. When I recorded the footage, I had a slower PC, so there are times the frame-rate will drop in the movie. It has a wealth of subtitles including English, Greek, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles.\r\n\r\n-----STORY-----\r\n\r\nHeather, an average girl shopping at the mall, gets pulled into a nightmare filled with monsters. She later discovers there are dark secrets between her and the mysterious town of Silent Hill, then ventures forth for answers.\r\n\r\n-----CREDITS-----\r\n\r\n1999 - 2003 Â© Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo\r\n\r\nAll the credit goes to Team Silent and Konami for publishing this game.
