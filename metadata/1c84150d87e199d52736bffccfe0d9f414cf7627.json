With one eye on the ticking clock, competitors have to outcook and outsmart their competition in three casino-themed challenges -- slots, poker and roulette -- for a chance to win a $30,000 jackpot. Chefs at the top of their game should be able to make magic with whatever Lady Luck puts in front of them, but these competitors will have to double-down on their skills or risk being eighty-sixed. Place your bets!\n\n\n\n\nKitchen Casino - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\nHigh Steaks\n\nFour chefs are excited to gamble on their skills but the slot machine proves to be difficult when a chef takes a chance with meatballs. In round two there are high stakes with flank steaks and a chef goes bust when the roulette wheel is just too much to handle. Chips are stacked high in the final round of poker and the chef with the best strategy for salami, rutabaga and fruit punch gets a chance to win $30,000 at the winner's wheel.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Apr-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c84150d87e199d52736bffccfe0d9f414cf7627","amp;dn":"Kitchen.Casino.S01E01.High.Steaks.PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c84150d87e199d52736bffccfe0d9f414cf7627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,132,21,13,135,225,153,213,39,54,191,252,207,224,217,244,20,207,118,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
