Even on these early dates, Brown's fluid, irrepressible six-string mastery and his penchant for genre blending--bridging rock &amp; roll, jump blues, swing, and down-home gutbucket wailing--are in ample evidence.\n\nDiverse session musicians provide the driving rhythm back-up, striding piano and punchy horns, but it's Brown's guitar work, throaty, bluesy singing and impressive multi-instrumentalism-he's also featured on harmonica on &quot;Gate's Salty Blues&quot; and violin on &quot;Just Before Dawn&quot;--that takes center stage. Whether on the steamy slow blues of &quot;For Now So Long,&quot; the walking groove of &quot;Ain't That Dandy,&quot; or the scintillating rock-swing rave-up of &quot;Okie Dokie Stomp,&quot; where Brown's guitar weaves wild, intricate webs around a horn-punctuated rhythm, this is no-nonsense, get-up-and-dance good time music of the highest order. The Original Peacock Recordings is among the essential discs in this Texas legend's extensive catalogue.\n\nRecorded in Houston, Texas between 1952 &amp; 1959\n\n\nTracklist:\n1  Midnight Hour   2:45 \n2  Sad Hour   2:45 \n3   Ain't That Dandy   2:51 \n4  That's Your Daddy Yaddy Yo   2:41 \n5   Dirty Work at the Crossroads   2:48 \n6   Hurry Back Good News   2:48 \n7   Okie Dokie Stomp   2:31 \n8   Good Looking Woman   2:34 \n9  Gate's Salty Blues   2:38 \n10  Just Before Dawn   2:06 \n11  Depression Blues   2:53 \n12  For Now So Long   2:43\n\n\nPersonnel includes: Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown (vocals, guitar, violin, harmonica); Nathaniel Douglas (guitar); Johnny Parker (alto saxophone); Bill Harvey (tenor saxophone); Fred Ford, Allen Clarke (baritone saxophone); Henry Boozier (trumpet); Jimmy McCracklin, Paul Monday, Carl Owens (piano); Joe Toussaint, Ray Johnson, Carl Lott (bass); San Frisco Jeff, Jual Curtis, Duke Barker, Emile Russell (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978eaa20bda169bfc627649aac53ac9fc6c292f4","amp;dn":"Clarence+Gatemouth+Brown+The+Original+Peacock+Recordings%28blues%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978eaa20bda169bfc627649aac53ac9fc6c292f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,142,170,32,189,161,105,191,198,39,100,154,172,83,172,159,198,194,146,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
