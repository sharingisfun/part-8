Yet what exactly is street photography? From what viewpoint does it present its subjects, and how does this viewpoint differ from that of documentary photography? Looking closely at the work Atget, Kertesz, Bovis, Rene-Jacques, Brassai, Doisneau, Cartier- Bresson and more, this elegantly written book unpicks Parisian street photography's complex relationship with parallel literary trends from Baudelaire to Soupault as well as its more evident affinity with Impressionist art. Street Photography reveals the genre to be poetic, even &quot;picturesque,&quot; looking not to the type but to the individual, not to the reality of the street but to its &quot;romance.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faefe6a3b2e4bed1ed60f529b887896fb8344ad9","amp;dn":"Street+Photography+-+from+Atget+to+Cartier-Bresson+%28Photography+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faefe6a3b2e4bed1ed60f529b887896fb8344ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,239,230,163,178,228,190,209,237,96,245,41,184,135,137,111,184,52,74,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
