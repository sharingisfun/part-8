McWhinney's Textbook of Family Medicine is one of the seminal texts in the field. While many family medicine texts simply cover the disorders a practitioner might see in clinical practice, McWhinney defines the principles and practices of family medicine as a separate and distinct field of practice. The initial sections cover basic principles and philosophies of family medicine and a later section discusses approaches to common diseases encountered in practice. The discussions not only address these clinical problems, but each is a workshop for incorporating what it means to be a family physician into everyday practice. The new edition is updated throughout with help from a group of reviewers and a new coauthor, Thomas Freeman, Chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Western Ontario, where McWhinney is Professor Emeritus.\n\n\n*** Sharing is caring, Please Seed ***\n\n\nComments are welcomed, but be easy on me - I'm new at this!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bddcfbd330a086c201f4fd0f4408d50c81ae57b","amp;dn":"Textbook+of+Family+Medicine%2C+3rd+Edition+2009.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bddcfbd330a086c201f4fd0f4408d50c81ae57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,221,207,189,51,10,8,108,32,31,79,208,244,64,141,80,200,26,229,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
