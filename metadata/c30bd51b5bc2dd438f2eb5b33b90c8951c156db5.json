Half soused, with a 2 a.m. shadow and street urchin rags, Serking waltzes through the scummiest neighborhoods of the City of Angels, soaking up booze, poetry, and copulation, and lounging in flophouses and on grimy public buses. His bedmates are a midget, a string of seedy whores, and various earthy L.A. denizens, played by Susan Tyrell, Ornella Muti, and others; he eventually falls for a prostitute who can express her affection only via self-mutilation. Ferreri lets Bukowski's ribald humor flow throughout and exposes the dark erotic currents at the heart of the author's narratives. Laced with perverse, shocking imagery, this unbridled celebration of life's dark underbelly has been praised by critics such as The New Yorker's Pauline Kael and Playboy's Bruce Williamson for its &quot;genuine audacity and risktaking.&quot; \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Storie di ordinaria follia.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.31 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 849 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1 648 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.266\n      Stream size : 1.17 GiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0SMP (UTC 2006-01-08)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 140 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086410/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086410/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nRipped and posted originally at KG by stiller, whom we thank\n\nMarco Ferreri - Storie di ordinaria follia (1981)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c30bd51b5bc2dd438f2eb5b33b90c8951c156db5","amp;dn":"Marco+Ferreri+-+Storie+di+ordinaria+follia+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c30bd51b5bc2dd438f2eb5b33b90c8951c156db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,11,213,27,91,194,221,67,143,46,181,179,59,144,200,149,28,21,109,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
