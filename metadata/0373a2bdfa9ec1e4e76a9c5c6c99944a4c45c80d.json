Most will remember them only from their pillowy single, &quot;There She Goes,&quot; but this album is replete with delightfully jangly, remarkably well-crafted songs and deserves to be waived from the stigma of one-hit-wonderdom. Lead singer and songwriter Lee Mavers is largely the culprit responsible for the success and failure of this album; a perfectionist, he ultimately paralyzed the album's momentum with band-member changes, the relentless rerecording of songs, and obsession over details, which caused fatal delays in its completion and release. But his pursuit of perfection was nearly achieved--almost every song had potential as a successful single. Truly a sleeper classic.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 93\nArtist: The La's\nAlbum: The La's (remastered 2001)\nYear: 2001 (original 1991)\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0373a2bdfa9ec1e4e76a9c5c6c99944a4c45c80d","amp;dn":"The+La%5C%27s+-+The+La%5C%27s+%5BFLAC-2001%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0373a2bdfa9ec1e4e76a9c5c6c99944a4c45c80d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,115,162,189,250,158,193,228,231,106,156,92,108,153,148,74,76,69,200,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
