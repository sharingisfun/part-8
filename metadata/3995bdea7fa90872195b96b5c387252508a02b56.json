ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rougher and tougher sounding record than Live and Dangerous.\n\nThe majority of it was recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in London except for the songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“RenegadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killer On The LooseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which were recorded a few years earlier with Snowy White on guitar.\n\nTo make this final tour extra special, Lynott called upon former Thin Lizzy members Eric Bell, Brian Robertson, and Gary Moore to join him for an all-star jam at the end of the show. Guitarists Sykes, Gorham, Robertson, Bell and Moore all share the stage for a monstrous version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RockerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Gary Moore also plays on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black RoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and Brian Robertson on Ã¢â‚¬Å“EmeraldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3995bdea7fa90872195b96b5c387252508a02b56","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+Life%3A+Live+%2F+1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3995bdea7fa90872195b96b5c387252508a02b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,149,189,234,127,169,8,114,25,91,150,181,195,135,37,37,8,160,43,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
