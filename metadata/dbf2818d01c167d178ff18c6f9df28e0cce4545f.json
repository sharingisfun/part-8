It has a ribbon bar that displayâ€™s all possible actions made in O&amp;O, a list of available local drives and a few tabs: Cluster View, History of Defragmentation, Drive Status, Jobs, Reports and the File Status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cluster View displayâ€™s the amount of clusters arranged graphically as a block. The blocks are shown in priortized colors â€“ Free, Compressed, Allocated, Fragmented, Reserved for MFT, System, Paging File, Locked Exclusively, Being Processed and Folders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShadow Copy is a feature that automatically creates copies of files that are currently being used, at regular time intervals. It can enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisk Defragmentation can be performed in several ways â€“ Stealth (faster and usesd little memory), Space (Consolidates data, and further information is prevented), Complete/Name, Complete/Modified or Complete/Access (these three methods also reorganize file structure in alphabetical order or according to the last time when they were modified or accessed(.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is possible to schedule a defragmentation (once or at a regular time interval) so it automatically performs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO&amp;O Defrag Professional Edition can also adapt itself to system load (thanks to the O&amp;O Activity Guard), create a before and after reoport, use power management for notebooks, defrag when the screensaver is running, defrag multiple drives simultanously or individuals files and directories and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy tests were run on a heavily fragmented partition of 250 GB and O&amp;O did a good job, but not extraordinary. Space could have been further optimized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCPU and memory are either moderately or highly demanded (according to the type of defragmentation) when O&amp;O is performing a task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll-in All, O&amp;O Defrag Professional Edition is a great piece of software for defragmentation purposes. It improves the boot time and the overall performance of your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Support for Windows 10 Preview\r\n- ENGINE TRIM optimization of certain SSDs improved\r\n- ENGINE various optimizations of Thin Provisioning Optimization\r\n- ENGINE Checkdisk functionality did not work properly with Asian language edition of Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf2818d01c167d178ff18c6f9df28e0cce4545f","amp;dn":"O%26amp%3BO+Defrag+Professional+19.5.222+%2B+Serial+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf2818d01c167d178ff18c6f9df28e0cce4545f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,242,129,141,1,193,103,209,120,255,24,198,249,223,40,224,204,228,84,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
