The new edition has been \n\ndeveloped as a result of intensive consultation with trainees in OB/GYN as to what they want, what they need and how they learn.\n\n\nThe book is organised into two halves covering obstetrics and gynaecology. Within each, the chapters are structured into sections containing pedagogic features such as \n\nboxes, highlights and key points for the first time. It contains everything the clinician needs to practice the art of obstetrics and gynaecology and sufficient \n\ninformation to help sub-specialists develop their specific interests. This text is recommended reading for the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology membership \n\nexamination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c21e00940fc0f2ed5a0f2692c7a6236a2303a17f","amp;dn":"Dewhurts+Gynecology+Obstetrics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c21e00940fc0f2ed5a0f2692c7a6236a2303a17f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,30,0,148,15,192,242,237,90,15,38,146,199,166,35,106,35,3,161,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
