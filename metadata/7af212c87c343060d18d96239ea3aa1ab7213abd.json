Emery\n\nLoneliness suffocates the heart. Acceptance breaks down walls.\n\nAs a Lost Girl to the Forsaken Motorcycle Club, Nicole Whelan knows how to party. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not cut-out for relationships and her life is way too complicated for anything more than casual encounters. But one night when she falls into DukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bed at the clubhouse, he sees something in her that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go ofÃ¢â‚¬â€no matter how many times she tries to run.\n\nHaving been left to raise her teenage brother, Jeremy, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already got her hands full and isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking for anymore complications. But DukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just watched his best friend fall for the only girl he couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have, and then almost lose her so shortly after, shaking him to his core. Faced with his own loneliness, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more determined than ever to break down NicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s walls and show her that he can be good for her; but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a bad track record and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a bad temper. Changing his ways isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even changing for.\n\nThe violence and turmoil are at an all-time high, and Forsaken is in a vulnerable place when a twist of fate breathes new life into the club. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a much-needed beacon of hope for the embattled biker family, even if everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not exactly on board. With Duke and NicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship already on shaky ground, and something even more important at stake, the Forsaken Motorcycle Club will fight like hell to keep their family together and whole.\n\nLove is never more precious than when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af212c87c343060d18d96239ea3aa1ab7213abd","amp;dn":"J.C.+Emery+Thrash+%28Bayonet+Scars+%232%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af212c87c343060d18d96239ea3aa1ab7213abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,242,18,200,124,52,48,96,209,141,150,35,158,163,170,26,183,33,58,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
