Fan et al. (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nThe presence of chemicals in our environment is a subject of intense interest owing to the many potential adverse health effects to humans following exposure to these chemicals. The principles and practices of risk assessment are used to assess the associated health risks to provide a scientific and health basis for guidance or regulatory standards development and risk management decision making for public health protection.\r\n\r\nThis book compiles, discusses, and presents cutting-edge research data and methodology in performing risk assessment of some major chemicals of concern in our environment. It also discusses the complexity of the scientific databases, the available and updated methodology, emerging issues, limitations in knowledge and methods, considerations of developmental and age sensitivities, use of defaults, case samples on results in risk assessment and risk management, and current and future perspectives. The editors are prominent in the field of environmental toxicology, risk assessment, and chemical regulations. This book will appeal to those interested in evaluating the human health effects of exposure to chemicals in the environment and the associated assessments and findings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4f1b3759c66b4e2aad346dad54b1610025154a","amp;dn":"Toxicology+and+Risk+Assessment+-+Anna+M.+Fan+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4f1b3759c66b4e2aad346dad54b1610025154a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,79,27,55,89,198,107,78,42,173,52,109,173,84,177,97,0,37,21,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
