In 1950 alone, he scored three No. 1 R&amp;B hits. This three-disc set collects all his recordings for Savoy between 1949 and 1952, as well as a handful of earlier sides, beginning with his 1945 version of &quot;Harlem Nocturne.&quot; The set traces the evolution of Otis's style from big-band jazz toward earthier blues and R&amp;B. &quot;Little&quot; Esther Phillips was featured on Otis's biggest hit, &quot;Double Crossing Blues.&quot; Other lead singers in the ongoing Caravan (and on this collection) included Mel Waters (who recalls Charles Brown with a lighter vocal tone), the doo-wop group the Robins, and Linda Hopkins. Guitarist Pete Lewis, saxophonist Big Jay McNeely, and Otis himself on vibraphone are crucial instrumental contributors. Despite Rhythm and Blues Caravan's zoot-suit trappings, there is a dreamy innocence and humor to this music that's largely missing from contemporary R&amp;B. There's also an endearing strangeness that served as a formative influence on the young Frank Zappa, among others. --Rick Mitchell    \n\nRead more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Otis\n\nEnjoy!\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
