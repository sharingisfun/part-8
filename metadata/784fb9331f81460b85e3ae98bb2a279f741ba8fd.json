Haunted by the memory of his sisterâ€™s death on 9/11, Kennedy takes his job and the protection of the American people very seriously. So when heâ€™s kidnapped and recruited into a CIA ghost operation known as Red Carpet, he jumps at the opportunity to become a civilian asset working with a team of some of the CIA's best counterterrorism analysts and spec ops soldiers as they race against the clock to stop the greatest terrorist threat the United States will ever face.\r\n\r\nShane Kuhnâ€™s bold, darkly comic voice has earned him rave reviews for his previous series, starting with the Internâ€™s Handbook, which was called, â€œa serious guilty pleasureâ€ by The Seattle Times and, â€œexplosively violent and psychologically wily the way a good thriller should beâ€ by the New York Post. Shane brings that same intense voice and gripping storytelling to The Assetâ€”an edge-of-your seat read you wonâ€™t be able to put down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:784fb9331f81460b85e3ae98bb2a279f741ba8fd","amp;dn":"The+Asset+by+Shane+Kuhn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"784fb9331f81460b85e3ae98bb2a279f741ba8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,79,185,51,31,129,70,11,133,227,174,152,187,42,39,159,116,27,168,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
