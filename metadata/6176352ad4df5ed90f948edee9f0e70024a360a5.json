Tracy plays New York sportswriter Sam Craig, who becomes incensed at comments about the uselessness of sports made by foreign correspondent Tess Harding (Hepburn). Sam and Tess subsequently use their respective columns to carry on a feud-at least, until they finally meet face to face. After Sam takes Tess to her first baseball game (one of the funniest scenes ever committed to celluloid), the two fall in love. Once married, however, their happiness is threatened by their wildly divergent lifestyles (Sam hadn't intended to spend his honeymoon helping to hide a prominent European refugee from the authorities, nor is Tess prepared for her husband's rowdy sports-oriented pals). When Tess is voted &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, a jealous Sam walks out on her. She endeavors to win him back by cooking him breakfast-with disastrous results. Despite their oil-and-water relationship, Sam and Tess are made for each other, and they're back together for the final fadeout. A hands-down winner at the box office, Woman of the Year earned a &quot;best original screenplay&quot; Oscar for Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin. Nominated for an award was director George Stevens, an RKO contractee brought to MGM at Hepburn's insistence. And need we remind you at this late date of the subsequent lifelong romance between stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn? \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035567/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035567/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSubs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-3695&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-3695&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:49:35\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x416 4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 766 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,13 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6176352ad4df5ed90f948edee9f0e70024a360a5","amp;dn":"Woman+of+the+Year+%281942%29+Spencer+Tracy%2CKatharine+Hepburn+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6176352ad4df5ed90f948edee9f0e70024a360a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,118,53,42,212,223,94,217,15,148,142,222,233,240,231,0,36,163,96,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
