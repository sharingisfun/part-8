The Hall of Uselessness forms the most complete collection yet of LeysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fascinating essays, from Quixotism to China, from the sea to literature.\n\nLeys feuds with Christopher Hitchens, ponders the popularity of Victor Hugo and analyses the posthumous publication of NabokovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfinished novel. He offers valuable insights into MaoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cultural Revolution and the Khmer Rouge, and discusses Orwell, Waugh and Confucius. \n\nHe considers the intertwined nature of Chinese art, culture and history alongside the joys and difficulties of literary translation. The Hall of Uselessness is an illuminating compendium from a brilliant and highly acclaimed writer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a long-time resident of Australia who is truly a global citizen.\n\nGenre: General Non Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7144f12515fb992b841515df4fbb999275558d26","amp;dn":"The+Hall+of+Uselessness%3A+Collected+Essays+by+Simon+Leys+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7144f12515fb992b841515df4fbb999275558d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,68,241,37,21,251,153,43,132,21,21,223,79,187,153,146,117,85,141,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
