He sings lead vocals and plays harmonica for his band Huey Lewis and the News, in addition to writing or co-writing many of the band's songs. The band is perhaps best known in American popular culture for their third album Sports and their contribution to the soundtrack of the 1985 feature film Back to the Future. Huey Lewis also played with the band Clover from 1972 to 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Flies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The Best of \n\n\nTime Flies is a greatest hits or compilation album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1996 (see 1996 in music). The album also features four previously unreleased tracks. This marks the first time &quot;The Power of Love&quot; was available on a Huey Lewis and the News album, though it had previously been available on the UK release of the Fore! album. The song &quot;So Little Kindness&quot; was later included on the 2001 album Plan B because Huey Lewis felt it needed a second chance.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (Colla, Lewis) - 5:04 \n2.\t&quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (Chapman, Chinn) - 4:12 \n3.\t&quot;Doing It All for My Baby&quot; (Duke, Cody) - 3:37 \n4.\t&quot;Do You Believe in Love&quot; (Lange) - 3:28 \n5.\t&quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (Colla, Gibson, Hayes, Hopper, Lewis, Cipollina) - 4:32 \n6.\t&quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Hayes, Lewis, Colla) - 3:54 \n7.\t&quot;If This Is It&quot; (Colla, Lewis) - 3:52 \n8.\t&quot;Bad Is Bad&quot; (Colla, Lewis) - 3:47 \n9.\t&quot;Workin' For a Livin'&quot; (Colla, Gibson, Hayes, Hopper, Lewis, Cipollina) - 2:39 \n10.\t&quot;It's Alright&quot; (Mayfield) - 3:04 \n11.\t&quot;Stuck with You&quot; (Hayes, Lewis) - 4:26 \n12.\t&quot;I Want a New Drug&quot; (Hayes, Lewis) - 4:45 \n13.\t&quot;100 Years from Now&quot; (M.
