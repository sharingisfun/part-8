Barcelo and Igor Bogdanovic\nCRC Press | June 2015 | ISBN-10: 1482226812 | PDF | 528 pages | 18.5 mb\n\nAlthough many archaeologists have a good understanding of the basics in computer science, statistics, geostatistics, modeling, and data mining, more literature is needed about the advanced analysis in these areas. This book aids archaeologists in learning more advanced tools and methods while also helping mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with no previous knowledge of the field realize the potential of the methods in archaeological experiments. \n\nCONTENTS\nForeword v\nPreface ix\nINTRODUCTION\n1.
