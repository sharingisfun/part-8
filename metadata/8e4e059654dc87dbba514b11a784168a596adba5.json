PRAG is the story of a distant, ever-absent father who, even after passing away, traumatizes all who have known him. And PRAG is the story of a marriage on the verge of collapse, in which Christoffer wants one thing and Maja another. A story of an old love, constantly transformed; at once, rooted, fragile, vulnerable, forgotten and rediscovered. A marriage where secrets, one after the other, come bursting out of the closet. \n\n\nCast\nMads Mikkelsen\nStine Stengade\nBorivoj NavrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡til\nJana PlodkovÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡\nJosef Vajnar\nMilan Duchek\nThomas W.
