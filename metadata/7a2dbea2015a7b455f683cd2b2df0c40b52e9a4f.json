Brand new series, 'Impossible Engineering', is a tribute to their achievements. Each episode details how giant structures, record-beating buildings, war ships and space crafts are built and work. As the show revels in these modern day creations, it also leaps back in time to recount the stories of the exceptional engineers whose technological advances made it all possible. How would they have ever existed without the historical work of their ancestors? Interviews with their great advocates bring engineering history to life and retell how these incredible accomplishments shaped the modern world.\n\n\n1)  Mega Bridge \nThe Rion Antirion Bridge is an engineering colossus, spanning almost two miles. Discover how engineers conquered deep water and hurricane force winds to build a structure that could stand strong in one of the most active earthquake zones on our planet.\n\n2)  Ultimate Warship \nThe HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier has a surface area larger than two soccer fields, and is stocked with cutting edge F35 fighter jets. Discover how this megaship ticks inside and out.\n\n3)  Skyscraper of the Future \nSoaring over 2,000 feet into the sky, the Shanghai Tower is the second tallest building in the world, and a futuristic engineering marvel. Discovery how cutting-edge technology means that the building's occupants will never feel it sway.\n\n4)  Ultimate Airport \nThe Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay, Japan, is built on the largest man-made island in the world. Discover how engineers built an artificial island on top of clay seabed to make the most daring engineering project of modern times a success.\n\n5)  Worlds Fastest Train \nThe Shanghai Magleve is the fastest passenger train in operation on the planet. Discover how engineers were able to design a train that could levitate, and reach a phenomenal top speed of 268 mph.\n\n6)  Worlds Largest Plane \nWe take the world's largest plane apart and show what makes this engineering marvel so incredible. Explore the Airbus A380 inside and out, and discover how its engineers redefined the limits of modern aviation.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;de96b7b9b69e92eaf0ef&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3420 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 6\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a2dbea2015a7b455f683cd2b2df0c40b52e9a4f","amp;dn":"Impossible.Engineering.Series.1.4of6.Ultimate.Airport.720p.HDTV.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a2dbea2015a7b455f683cd2b2df0c40b52e9a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,45,190,162,1,90,123,69,95,104,60,210,178,223,12,64,181,46,154,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
