The film is silent and mostly shot in 16 frames per second.\n\nThe film in its entirety is around four hours long, so it is divided into two parts:\n\n* Der groÃƒÅ¸e Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit\n* Inferno: Ein Spiel um Menschen unserer Zeit\n\nSynopsis\n\nMabuse is a doctor of psychology and master of disguise. He tricks many people out of money by conning them and using hypnotism. He murders many people, and towards the end sees their ghosts, and goes mad. It is debatable about whether he saw the ghosts because he was mad, or that seeing the ghosts sent him mad. He is then sent to an asylum which is the setting for the next film, Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (The Testament of Dr. Mabuse, also known as The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse) ten years on.\n\nIMDB: 7.7/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013086/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013086/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d981d6c8250da085c694809e63a04a27ebce94","amp;dn":"Dr.+Mabuse%2C+der+Spieler+aka+Dr.+Mabuse%2C+the+Gambler+%281922%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d981d6c8250da085c694809e63a04a27ebce94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,217,129,214,200,37,13,160,133,198,148,128,158,99,160,74,39,235,206,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
