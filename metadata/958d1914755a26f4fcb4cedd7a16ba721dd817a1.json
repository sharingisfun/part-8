The album is titled after a grooming product that was used popularly by African Americans during the 1970s, amid the trend of the Afro hair style. On the purpose of using it as the album title, rapper Ishmael &quot;Butterfly&quot; Butler of the group said, &quot;It means the utilization of the natural, a natural style&quot;. The album features guest contributions by East Coast rappers such as Guru, Jeru the Damaja, and Jazzy Joyce. It contains lyrics concerning themes of rapping prowess and the inner city, as well as black nationalism and the Five Percent Nation.\n\nBlowout Comb proved to be Digable Planets's last studio album, since the group disbanded in 1995 due to creative differences. It was reissued on vinyl LP in 2013 by Light in the Attic Records.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://musicbrainz.org/release/da976a96-c18a-464b-8d7e-8382a3a498a7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://musicbrainz.org/release/da976a96-c18a-464b-8d7e-8382a3a498a7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Digable-Planets-Blowout-Comb/release/897888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Digable-Planets-Blowout-Comb/release/897888&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:958d1914755a26f4fcb4cedd7a16ba721dd817a1","amp;dn":"+Digable+Planets+-+Blowout+Comb+%281994%29+%28flac%2C+eac%2C+cue+%2B+log%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"958d1914755a26f4fcb4cedd7a16ba721dd817a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,141,25,20,117,90,38,244,252,180,206,221,122,22,186,114,29,216,23,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
