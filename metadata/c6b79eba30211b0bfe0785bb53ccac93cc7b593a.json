Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining.\n\nThe game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries.\n\nMedieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.\n\nMedieval Engineers is the second Ã¢â‚¬Å“engineeringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller.\nEarly Access\n\n    Game modes\n    - Creative - unlimited resources, instant building, invulnerability, levitation\n    Single-player\n    Multi-player Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will be added in a future update\n    Barbarians - coming soon...\n    First-person &amp; Third-person\n    Voxel hand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shape the terrain and its material (right now only creative mode voxel hand is implemented)\n    Block types:\n    - Small: 0.25 meter (25 centimeters)\n    - Large: 2.5 meters\n    - Dynamic: can be used to construct carriages and machinery that is supposed to be moved around\n    - Static: immovable and connected to earth; if a heavy load breaks its structural integrity it cracks and unsupported parts become dynamic\n    Building blocks: stone walls (various shapes - from blocky to rounded), wooden walls and flooring, roofs (ceramic, thatched, hay), power source blocks (manual human labor), stored energy blocks (torsion spring), leverages, weights, swings, ropes, wooden beams of various length and shapeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ More will be added in future!\n    Realistic physics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ structural integrity, destructible objects (everything: from blocks to terrain), real proportions, volume, mass, storage capacity, integrity\n    Steam Workshop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ share your creations with the Community\n    Modding - world files, 3D models, textures, shaders, API (scripting in-game objects in C#)\n    32-bit &amp; 64-bit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 64-bit version expands the amount of objects and blocks (almost unlimited) and terrain\n    World management Ã¢â‚¬â€œ generate new worlds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“save asÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settings\n\n    NOT IMPLEMENTED YET\n\n        Survival - this mode is a work-in-progress and only death/respawn, slow construction and no-levitation are implemented.\n        To be added: resource management and inventory; material harvesting and processing; tools using\n        Mechanical blocks: rotors, transmissions, transitions\n        Wind power source block\n        Building blocks: torches and other sources of artificial light, flags... More will be added in the future!\n\n    More to be added later\n\n    Please be sure to read the list of current features before you buy the game.

The performance will get better. The performance depends on the complexity of your world and the configuration of your computer. Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t guarantee a perfect experience.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n    Minimum:\n        OS: Windows Vista SP2 32-Bit (with KB971512 System Update)\n        Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 2.4 GHz, AMD Athlon II X4 620 @ 2.6 GHz or better\n        Memory: 3 GB RAM\n        Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 5830 / NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450 with at least 1024 MB VRAM or better\n        DirectX: Version 11\n        Hard Drive: 5 GB available space\n        Additional Notes: No internet connection required to play the game \n\n    Recommended:\n        OS: Windows 7 SP1 64-Bit\n        Processor: Core i5-680 @ 3.6GHz, Phenom II X4 810 or better\n        Memory: 8 GB RAM\n        Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 7870 / NVIDIA Geforce GTX 660 with 3 GB VRAM or better\n        DirectX: Version 11\n        Hard Drive: 5 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b79eba30211b0bfe0785bb53ccac93cc7b593a","amp;dn":"Medieval+Engineers+v02.005.017","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b79eba30211b0bfe0785bb53ccac93cc7b593a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,183,158,186,48,33,27,11,254,7,133,187,83,204,172,147,204,123,89,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
