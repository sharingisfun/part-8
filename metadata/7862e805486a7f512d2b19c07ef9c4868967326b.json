They said no human could ever run a mile in less than four minutes. In 1952, three amazing athletes begged to differ. This is their extraordinary tale.\n- - -\n\nFrom NealBascomb.com:\n\nhere was a time when running the mile in four minutes was believed to be entirely beyond the limits of human foot speed. And in all of sport it was the elusive holy grail. In 1952, after suffering defeat at the Helsinki Olympics, three world-class runners set out individually to break this formidable barrier. Roger Bannister was a young English medical student who epitomized the ideal of the amateurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½still driven not just by winning but by the nobility of the pursuit. John Landy was the privileged son of a genteel Australian family, who as a boy preferred butterfly collecting to running but who trained relentlessly in an almost spiritual attempt to shape his mind and body to this singular task. Then there was Wes Santee, the swaggering American, a Kansas farm boy who was a natural athlete and who believed he was just plain better than everybody else. \n\nSantee was the first to throw down the gauntlet in what would become a three-way race of body, heart, and soul. Each young man endured thousands of hours of training, bore the weight of his nation's expectations on his shoulders, and still dared to push his very limits. Their collective quest captivated the world and stole headlines from the Korean War, the atomic race, and such legendary figures as Edmund Hillary, Willie Mays, Native Dancer, and Ben Hogan. Who would be the first to achieve the unachievable? And who among them would be the best when they went head to head? In the answer came the perfect mile. \n\nIn the tradition of Seabiscuit and Chariots of Fire, a breathtaking story of unlikely heroes that leaves us with a lasting portrait of the twilight years of the golden age of sport. \n- - -\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe Perfect Mile: Three Athletes, One Goal, and Less Than Four Minutes to Achieve It by Neal Bascomb is a non-fiction book about three runners and their attempts to become the first man to run a mile under four minutes. The runners are Englishman Roger Bannister, American Wes Santee, and Australian John Landy. The book's climax is Bannister's breaking of the record on May 6, 1954.\n\nThe New York Times' review calls it an &quot;enthralling book&quot; and says Bascomb &quot;expertly winds up the tension of the three men's many failed attempts to get closer to the magic mark, before Bannister wrote himself into legend first on a windy day at the Oxford University track&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7862e805486a7f512d2b19c07ef9c4868967326b","amp;dn":"THE+PERFECT+MILE+-+Neal+Bascomb.+Read+Nelson+Runger+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7862e805486a7f512d2b19c07ef9c4868967326b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,98,232,5,72,106,127,81,45,43,25,192,126,249,196,134,137,103,50,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
