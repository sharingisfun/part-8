Superstar Michael Jackson gets sent up twice: &quot;Bad&quot; is transformed into\n&quot;Fat&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot; becomes &quot;Eat It,&quot; a hit in its own right. Robert Palmer's\n&quot;Addicted to Love&quot; is turned into a paean to potatoes, &quot;Addicted to Spuds.&quot; And Los\nLobos' version of the durable &quot;La Bamba&quot; is reconfigured into &quot;Lasagna.&quot; Madonna's\n&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; becomes a song about a different kind of beginner on &quot;Like a Surgeon,&quot;while James Brown's &quot;Living in America&quot; is parodied on &quot;Living with a Hernia.&quot; If you want to take a funhouse mirror trip back to the 1980s, Greatest Hits is a good way to do it. Produced by rock &amp; roll veteran Rick Derringer, who rocked out with Johnny and Edgar Winter and produced Meatloaf and Kiss. --Fred Cisterna\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Fat                                                  [03:37]\n02.Eat it                                               [03:22]\n03.Like A surgeon                                       [03:32]\n04.Ricky                                                [02:37]\n05.Addicted to spuds                                    [03:53]\n06.Living with A hernia                                 [03:21]\n07.Dare to be stupid                                    [03:26]\n08.Lasagna                                              [02:47]\n09.I lost on jeopardy                                   [03:29]\n10.One more minute                                      [04:03]\n________\n34:07 min\n 48,2 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
