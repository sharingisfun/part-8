The Cold War era is defined by Vietnam war, the missile crisis in Cuba (that almost caused a global nuclear war), and numerous coups and counter-coups that often resulted in armed conflicts and civil wars in many parts of the world. \n\nTyrannical regimes were often installed (in countries in Africa, South America, Asia and the Middle East) that caused great sufferings to their own people. Many of these tyrannical regimes are still in power today.\n\nWe have 30 titles in this upload:\n\n Carruthers - Cold War Captives; Imprisonment, Escape, and Brainwashing (2009)\n\nCIA Documents on the Cuban Missile Crisis (CIA, 1992)\n\nCraig &amp; Logevall - America's Cold War; the Politics of Insecurity (2009)\n\nCraig &amp; Radchenko - The Atomic Bomb and the Origins of the Cold War (2008)\n\nCrockatt - The Fifty Years War; The United States and the Soviet Union in World Politics, 1941Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1991 (1995)\n\nDallek - The Lost Peace; Leadership in a Time of Horror and Hope, 1945-1953 (2010)\n\nDavid - Catastrophic Consequences; Civil Wars and American Interests (2005)\n\nDeRouen &amp; Heo - Civil Wars of the World; Major Conflicts since World War II (2007)\n\nGaddis - The Cold War; a New History (2005)\n\nGaddis (Ed.) - Cold War Statesmen Confront the Bomb; Nuclear Diplomacy since 1945 (1999)\n\nGeorge - Awaiting Armageddon; How Americans Faced the Cuban Missile Crisis (2003)\n\nHanes - Cold War Almanac, Biographies and Primary Sources - combined (2004)\n\nHiggs - Depression, War and Cold War; Studies in Political Economy (2006)\n\nHironaka - Never Ending Wars; the International Community, Weak States, and the Perpetuation of Civil War (2005)\n\nHoffman - The Dead Hand; the Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy (2009)\n\nJones - Understand the Cold War (2010)\n\nKaplan - The Coming Anarchy; Shattering the Dreams of the Post Cold War (2000)\n\nLebow &amp; Stein - We All Lost the Cold War (1994)\n\nLeffler &amp; Painter - The Origins of Cold War; an International History, 2e (2005)\n\nMedhurst - Critical Reflections on the Cold War; Linking Rhetoric and History (2000)\n\nMoran - The Day We Lost the H-Bomb; Cold War, Hot Nukes, and the Worst Nuclear Weapons Disaster in History (2009)\n\nMorgan &amp; Nelson - Re-viewing the Cold War; Domestic Factors and Foreign Policy in the East-West Confrontation (2000)\n\nRabe - U.S. Intervention in British Guiana; a Cold War Story (2005)\n\nSchofield &amp; Cocroft (Eds.) - A Fearsome Heritage; Diverse Legacies of the Cold War (2007)\n\nStern - The Week the World Stood Still; Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis (2005)\n\nStone - The Atlantic and Its Enemies; a Personal History of the Cold War (2010)\n\nSwift - The Palgrave Concise Historical Atlas of the Cold War (2003)\n\nTopping - On the Front Lines of the Cold War (2010)\n\nvan der Pijl - Global Rivalries from the Cold War to Iraq (2006)\n\nWinkler - The Cold War; a History in Documents (2000)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40b9f37d3e08b98c1d1c6482bfe5a0015a359fe","amp;dn":"Criticism+of+the+Western+Civilization+-+Collection+22+%28Cold+War%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40b9f37d3e08b98c1d1c6482bfe5a0015a359fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,11,159,55,211,224,139,152,193,209,198,72,43,254,90,0,21,163,89,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
