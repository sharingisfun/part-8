Designed for programmers who are familiar with object-oriented programming and basic data structures, this book focuses on practical concepts that see actual use in the game industry.\n \nSanjay Madhav takes a unique platform- and framework-agnostic approach that will help develop virtually any game, in any genre, with any language or framework. He presents the fundamental techniques for working with 2D and 3D graphics, physics, artificial intelligence, cameras, and much more.\n \nEach concept is illuminated with pseudocode that will be intuitive to any C#, Java, or C++ programmer, and has been refined and proven in MadhavÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game programming courses at the University of Southern California. Review questions after each chapter help solidify the most important concepts before moving on.\n \nMadhav concludes with a detailed analysis of two complete games: a 2D iOS side-scroller (written in Objective-Cusing cocos2d) and a 3D PC/Mac/Linux tower defense game (written in C# using XNA/ MonoGame). These games illustrate many of the algorithms and techniques covered in the earlier chapters, and the full source code is available at gamealgorithms.net.\n \nCoverage includes\nGame time management, speed control, and ensuring consistency on diverse hardware\nEssential 2D graphics techniques for modern mobile gaming\nVectors, matrices, and linear algebra for 3D games\n3D graphics including coordinate spaces, lighting and shading, z-buffering, and quaternions\nHandling todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wide array of digital and analog inputs\nSound systems including sound events, 3D audio, and digital signal processing\nFundamentals of game physics, including collision detection and numeric integration\nCameras: first-person, follow, spline, and more\nArtificial intelligence: pathfinding, state-based behaviors, and strategy/planning\nUser interfaces including menu systems and heads-up displays\nScripting and text-based data files: when, how, and where to use them\nBasics of networked games including protocols and network topology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691976bdebb13c1a0b84a86f3d7040196ffb585c","amp;dn":"Game+Programming+Algorithms+and+Techniques+A+Platform-Agnostic+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691976bdebb13c1a0b84a86f3d7040196ffb585c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,25,118,189,235,177,60,26,11,132,168,111,61,112,64,25,111,251,88,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
