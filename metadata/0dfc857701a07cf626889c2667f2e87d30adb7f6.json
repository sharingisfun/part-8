By:        Atlus (www.Atlus.com)\nRel. Date:      5/12/2009\nRequirements:   Modded/Chipped Ps2, or Swap Magic Disc Method.\n\nCompressed with WinRar, Game was tested and works.    \n\nNote: If you don't have winrar you can use 7-zip to extract rar formats, \n      7-zip is free google it.           \n\nThis is a Straight Rip from 'Brand New' Original Game Disc. And works perfectly.\n\n(Brand new as in factory sealed, fresh outta the box a clean rip) \n\nImportant: The screen will pause for about 14 seconds after the Ps2 logo then \n           loads the game, This is just how they made the game as the original \n           does the same thing.\n\nIf you can't get the game to start keep trying, sometimes older modded fat ps2 models do this with any game but don't get discouraged...The Game Image is clean and working exactly as the original. \n\nAnd the type of media you use is crucial use the DVD Media I described here for your Ps2 Console.\n \n(You could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.)\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or Tayio Yuden, burn at 8x if its a 16x max. You really can't use Maxell DVD+R for example or some other brand as it more than likely will not work.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nThe Hero of the Capital Returns!\n\nIt is still the prosperous Taisho era in JapanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capital when devil-summoning detective Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th is thrown into his next great case. When the Narumi Detective Agency is hired in a missing person case, Raidou finds himself on the trail of crooked gamblers, masked ninjas, and strange insects... all leading to the mysterious King Abaddon.\n\n* The Battle\n\n  Do battle with blades, bullets, and beasts, and discover the strategic \n  possibilities of the new MAG balancing system.\n\n* The Demons\n\n  Demon negotiation lets you choose whether to fight your enemies or recruit them.\n  Collect and fuse almost 200 demons, and take any two into battle!\n\n* The Weapons\n\n  Use the retooled Sword Alchemy system to create new swords with unique special   \n  attacks.\n\n* If you have previous save data from the first game (Soulless Army) you can load\n  that to unlock new bonuses.\n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nBurn with Dvd Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at half speed of your disc max speed write rate. \n(If Disc is x16 burn at x8, etc.)\n\nUse Verbatim DVD-R or DVD+R, Or use Tayio Yuden DVD's. \n(IF DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\nRegardless of how many seeds there are do your part to seed, you'd be surprised\nhow many people don't. \n\nSimply put no seeders no download, but Im sure you already knew that.\n\n\nAnother great Ps2 release in the Shin Megami Tensi series.\n\n\nIf your a fan of the first Devil Summoner you'll love this even more. It's way more beefed up.  And has some of the familiar features as well. Atlus really did a\nnice job on this one.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dfc857701a07cf626889c2667f2e87d30adb7f6","amp;dn":"Devil+Summoner+2+-+Raidou+Kuzunoha+vs.+King+Abaddon+%5BNtsc%5D+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dfc857701a07cf626889c2667f2e87d30adb7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,252,133,119,1,160,124,246,38,136,156,38,103,242,232,125,48,173,183,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
