Her recipes contain very few ingredients (less than 5 in many cases) and are notable for their simplicity and creative flavours. Presented in a unique design with Erin's own watercolour paintings and hand lettering, this book will be one part art book and one part cookbook in the tradition of top-selling Home Made by Yvette van Boven. The 100 recipes in the book are wholly vegetable based and will be organised according to dish type (appetizers, salads, main courses, sweets and cocktails). The majority will be brand new and never seen before on her site.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ultraimg.com/images/00340ad3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ultraimg.com/images/00340ad3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee10be4d143a9dbb5c64bad1e11186e9f7ee339b","amp;dn":"The+Forest+Feast+%282014%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee10be4d143a9dbb5c64bad1e11186e9f7ee339b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,16,190,77,20,58,157,187,92,100,186,209,225,17,134,233,247,238,51,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
