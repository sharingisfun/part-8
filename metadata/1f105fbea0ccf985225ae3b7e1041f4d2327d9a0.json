Although the Grateful Dead ultimately proved more long-lived and popular, Jefferson Airplane defined the San Francisco sound in the 1960s, with the acid rock guitar playing of Jorma Kaukonen and the soaring twin vocals of Grace Slick and Marty Balin, scoring hit singles and looking out from the covers of national magazines. They epitomized the drug-taking hippie ethos as well as the left-wing, antiwar political movement of their time, and their history was one of controversy along with hit records. Their personal interactions mirrored those times; the group was a collective with shifting alliances, in which leaders emerged and retreated. But for all the turmoil, Jefferson Airplane was remarkably productive between 1965 and 1972. They toured regularly, being the only band to play at all the major '60s rock festivals -- Monterey, Woodstock, even Altamont -- and they released seven studio albums, five of which went gold, plus two live LPs and a million-selling hits collection that chronicled their eight chart singles. Rather than formally breaking up, they mutated into other configurations, Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship, and went on to further success in the 1970s and '80s, before reuniting for an album and tour in 1989.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/jefferson-airplane-p4603/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/jefferson-airplane-p4603/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nWhite Rabbit &amp; Other Hits is a budget-priced, eight-track collection that contains several of Jefferson Airplane's most familiar songs (&quot;Somebody to Love,&quot; &quot;White Rabbit,&quot; &quot;Embryonic Journey,&quot; &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover,&quot; &quot;Volunteers&quot;), which makes it of interest to budget-minded consumers.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/white-rabbit-r10291&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/white-rabbit-r10291&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002W2O&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002W2O&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
