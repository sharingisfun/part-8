It follows instead a Judean contemporary, one Brian Cohen, who gets repeatedly mistaken for a messiah by overly zealous folks from the first day of his life right up to the last.\n\nIn the hands of the British Python troupe, who in today's pallid world look even more like giants of comedy than they originally did, Brian's story turns into a satire of the religious impulse, political correctness and anything else the Pythons can think of.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98668fb00f50456bca4a1c875909548df368a58d","amp;dn":"Monty+Python%5C%27s+Life+of+Brian.PAL.Multisubs.DVD-R.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98668fb00f50456bca4a1c875909548df368a58d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,102,143,176,15,80,69,107,202,74,28,135,89,9,84,141,243,104,165,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
