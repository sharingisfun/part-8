Because the protagonist is a dog, it is sometimes classified as a juvenile novel, suitable for children, but it is dark in tone and contains numerous scenes of cruelty and violence.\n\n - - - - -\nOne of London\\'s most popular novels, the plot storyline follows a dog named Buck, who is a four year old 140lb Saint Bernard and Scotch Shepard mix. Buck is abducted from a comfortable life as a pet and tossed into the maelstrom of the Yukon Gold Rush and the brutal realities of frontier life. Buck changes hands a number of times before landing in the kindly hands of John Thornton, a brief respite before the story\\'s final turn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77b72bf18450f8a0bf6e8755c63c79dacc5e885d","amp;dn":"THE+CALL+OF+THE+WILD+-+Jack+London.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77b72bf18450f8a0bf6e8755c63c79dacc5e885d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,183,43,241,132,80,248,160,191,110,135,85,198,60,121,218,204,94,136,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
