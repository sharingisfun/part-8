The band's debut full-length, The Airing of Grievances (which makes reference to a Seinfeld episode), was first released by Troubleman Unlimited in 2008, then picked up for wider distribution by XL Recordings in January 2009. For the band's impressive 2010 follow-up, The Monitor, Titus Andronicus beefed up the production value and enlisted the help of musicians from ten other indie acts, including members of the Hold Steady, Vivian Girls, and Ponytail. Two years later they returned with their third album, Local Business, a more personal album that found the band looking inward for inspiration. \n\nAll albums at a tasty 320 kbps.\n\nThe Airing of Grievances - 2008\n\nFear and Loathing in Mahwah, NJ\nMy Time Outside the Womb\nJoset of Nazareth's Blues\nArms Against Atrophy\nUpon Viewing Brueghel's &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;\nTitus Andronicus\nNo Future, Pt. 1\nNo Future, Pt. 2: The Days After No Future\nAlbert Camus\n\nThe Monitor - 2010\n\nA More Perfect Union\nTitus Andronicus Forever\nNo Future Pt. 3: Escape from No Future\nRichard II\nA Pot In Which To Piss\nFour Score and Seven\nTheme from &quot;Cheers&quot;\nTo Old Friends and New\n...And ever\nThe Battle of Hampton Roads\n\nLocal Business - 2012\n\nEcce Homo\nStill Life with Hot Deuce on Silver Platter\nUpon Viewing Orgeon's Landscape with the Flood of Detritus\nFood Fight!\nMy Eating Disorder\nTitus Andronicus vs. the Absurd Universe (3rd Round KO)\nIn a Big City\nIn a Small City\n(I Am The) Electric Man\nTried to Quit Smoking\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f969c888455d2699537c0950a0e7d3420bb7f8d","amp;dn":"Titus+Andronicus+-+Discography+-+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f969c888455d2699537c0950a0e7d3420bb7f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,150,156,136,132,85,210,105,149,55,192,149,10,14,125,52,32,187,127,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
