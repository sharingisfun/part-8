Racing through offices, storehouses and mysterious labs, your mission is to clear the base at any costs. \n\nThe game has two playing modes: campaign and survival and two characters. With unlimited playtime, ten thrilling levels, 9 unique weapons; 6 types of monsters to defeat, high-quality music and ambient, being the last hope of humanity has never been so exciting.\n\nOpen and unrar then play away.Full version.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nYou will need a 3D video card \n600MHz PC\nWindows operating system\n64 MB Memory\n\nEver just want to play a game that allows you to blast thousands of aliens? Now you can with the release of Alien Shooter from Big Fish Games. \n\nDifferent from all other games on the Big Fish Website, Alien Shooter is also the most graphic and violent. So if you have young children you should keep them away from the game. The game is easy to install and I was able to play it using Windows 98/ME/NT/2000 and XP without any install errors.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the better the video card the better the game looks. I really like the fact that I can change the color of the alien blood from green to red. You are walking to each level avoiding aliens, collecting weapons and cash to build up a weapons cache of the next level.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43e3c78baef79a56eb73d58d955a497c60e0190","amp;dn":"Alien+Shooter+%282003%29by+cweb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43e3c78baef79a56eb73d58d955a497c60e0190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,62,60,120,186,239,121,165,110,183,61,88,217,85,164,151,198,14,1,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
