The band played its set from its first tour: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Finding My Way,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best I Can,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“In the Mood,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anthem,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Need Some Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fly by Night,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here Again,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Larry Williams cover Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad Boy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Working Man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Here AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is played at an extremely slow tempo and the applause afterward is tepid.\n Geddy then says theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to speed things up a bit and they go into Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad Boy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The set ends with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Working ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and a Neil solo.\n\nThe view of unofficial CDs like this one is always mixed, but the recordings are worth listening to.\n The sonic quality is raw and the playing is raw.\n Whether you want to part with $39.99 to buy the CD on Amazon is another matter, since the tracks are available for download on The Pirate Bay. analogkid6103 is sending this out for those who live in the cold. that cuts like a razor.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n  Genre:\tProgressive\n \nSubgenre:\tProgressive Rock / Hard Rock\n  Bitrate:\t160 k\n  Size:\t72.68 MB\n   mp3  \n\n  Tracklist:\n  01.\nFinding My Way\n  02.
