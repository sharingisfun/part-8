I'd love to see this one return, or something like it from Roberta Gregory, because it was a fun, entertaining read. This book always felt a little to me like Roberta was keeping the underground comix torch burning. Considering it lasted until 2004 that's quite a feat. TPB has been missing this one, so I'm glad to pass it along (thanks to the scanners for finally completing this one).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNaughty Bits 1-40\n\nFantagraphics, 1991-2004\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Roberta Gregory\n\nThe story of Midge McCracken, aka Bitchy Bitch, the everyday life of a woman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a6b4b0f14476608e54889341e5a0e4341ad07d","amp;dn":"Roberta+Gregory+-+Naughty+Bits+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a6b4b0f14476608e54889341e5a0e4341ad07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,166,180,176,241,68,118,96,142,84,136,147,65,229,160,228,52,26,208,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
