During Carnival week, he sees Eurydice, who's fled her village in fear of a stalker; it's love at first sight. Her cousin Sarafina, with whom she stays in Rio, is a friend of Orfeo and Mira, so the star-crossed lovers meet again. Later, during the revels, wearing Sarafina's costume, Eurydice dances a provocative samba with Orfeo. Not only is Mira enraged when her rival is unmasked, but she is being stalked by Death: Eurydice is in danger, pursued through noisy crowds and a morgue. Can Orfeo conduct her to safety? Don't look back. \n\n------\n\nOrignal DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c1464ff0266bb53c72203e1fc453c5f5174942c","amp;dn":"Orfeu+Negro+%2F+Black+Orpheus+%28Marcel+Camus%2C+1959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c1464ff0266bb53c72203e1fc453c5f5174942c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,20,100,255,2,102,187,83,199,34,3,225,252,69,60,95,81,116,148,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
