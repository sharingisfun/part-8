The picture was directed by Sam Wood.\n\nThe film, which was Ronald Reagan's most notable role during his early acting career at Warner Brothers, was adapted by Casey Robinson from a best-selling 1940 novel of the same name by Henry Bellamann. The movie also features Betty Field, Charles Coburn, and Claude Rains. The musical score was composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and the cinematographer was James Wong Howe.\n\nIn the film, Reagan's character, Drake McHugh, has both legs amputated by a sadistic surgeon, played by Coburn. When he comes to following the operation, he gasps in shock, disbelief, and horror, &quot;Where's the REST of me???&quot; Reagan used that line as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Reagan and most film critics considered Kings Row his best movie. Reagan called the film a &quot;slightly sordid but moving yarn&quot; that &quot;made me a star.&quot;\n\n    CAST:-\n    Ann Sheridan as Randy Monaghan\n    Robert Cummings as Parris Mitchell\n    Ronald Reagan as Drake McHugh\n    Betty Field as Cassandra Tower\n    Charles Coburn as Dr. Henry Gordon\n    Claude Rains as Dr. Alexander Tower\n    Judith Anderson as Mrs. Harriet Gordon\n    Nancy Coleman as Louise Gordon\n    Kaaren Verne as Elise Sandor\n    Maria Ouspenskaya as Madame von Eln\n    Harry Davenport as Colonel Skeffington\n    Ernest Cossart as Pa Monaghan\n    Ilka GrÃƒÂ¼ning as Anna (as Ilka Gruning)\n    Pat Moriarity as Tod Monaghan\n    Minor Watson as Sam Winters\n\nDirected by Sam Wood\nProduced by Hal B.

They are Parris Mitchell (Robert Cummings), who lives with his grandmother (Maria Ouspenskaya); Cassandra Tower (Betty Field), daughter of Dr. Alexander Tower (Claude Rains); the wealthy orphan Drake McHugh (Ronald Reagan); Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman), daughter of the sadistic town physician Dr. Henry Gordon (Charles Coburn), who has been known to perform operations without anesthetic; and the tomboy Randy Monaghan (Ann Sheridan), whose father (Ernest Cossart) is a railroad worker.\nDrake McHugh (Ronald Reagan) with two lady friends in Kings Row.\n\nParris is attracted to Cassandra, whom the other children avoid because her family is &quot;strange&quot;: her mother is confined to the house and never seen. Dr. Tower takes Cassie out of school and Parris does not see her again until years later, when he begins his medical studies under Dr. Tower's tutelage.\n\nParris' best friend, Drake, intends to marry Louise despite the disapproval of her father. Louise, however, refuses to defy her parents and will not marry him. Parris and Cassie begin a secret romance, seeing each other at Drake's house. At about this time, Parris' grandmother becomes ill from terminal cancer and dies as he is about to go to Vienna for medical school. Parris, who decides to study psychiatry, proposes marriage to Cassie. She initially resists, running away, but later begs him to take her with him to Vienna. She then runs away again, back home.\n\nThe next day, Parris learns that Dr. Tower has poisoned Cassie and shot himself and has left his estate to him. He learns from Dr. Tower's notebook that he killed Cassie because he believed he saw early signs that she might go insane like her mother, and he wanted to prevent Parris from ruining his life by marrying her, just as Tower's life had been ruined by marrying Cassie's mother.\nDedicated young doctor Parris Mitchell (Robert Cummings) is secretly in love with his mentor's daughter.\n\nWhile Parris is in Vienna, Drake's trust fund is stolen by a dishonest bank official. He is forced to work for the railroad and is accidentally crushed by a boxcar. Dr. Gordon amputates both of his legs. Drake, who had been courting Randy before the accident, marries her but is now embittered by the loss of his legs and refuses to leave his bed. Nonetheless they commence a business, begun with Parris' financial help, building houses for working families. When Parris suggests they move into one of the homes they've built, away from the railroad tracks and sounds of the trains that plague Drake, he becomes hysterical and makes Randy swear to never make him leave the room.\n\nParris returns to Kings Row and decides to remain there, when he learns that Dr. Gordon has died, leaving the town with no doctor. Louise reveals that her father amputated Drake's legs, unnecessarily, because he hated Drake and thought it was his duty to punish wickedness. Parris at first wishes to withhold the truth from Drake, fearing it will destroy his fragile recovery. He considers confining Louise to a mental institution, even though she is not insane, to prevent the truth from being revealed to Drake and other victims of her father. But instead, persuaded by his new friend Elise (Kaaren Verne) to treat Drake like any other patient rather than his best friend, he tells Drake what happened. Drake reacts with defiance and summons a renewed will to live instead of the deep clinical depression Parris had feared. Parris is now free to marry Elise, having helped his old friend return to a productive life.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 127 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 127 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94954b298d5f48ab6aa8610ffc362e3334769b4b","amp;dn":"Kings+Row+%281942%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Ronald+Reagan%2C+Ann+Sheridan+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94954b298d5f48ab6aa8610ffc362e3334769b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,149,75,41,141,95,72,171,106,168,97,15,252,54,46,51,52,118,155,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
