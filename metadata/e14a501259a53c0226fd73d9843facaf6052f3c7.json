Bonamassa opened for B.B. King when he was only 12 years old. In the last 13 years Bonamassa has put out 15 solo albums through his independent record label, J&amp;R Adventures. Eleven of his solo albums have reached #1 on the Billboard Blues charts. He has played alongside such artists as Stephen Stills, Eric Clapton, Foreigner, Buddy Guy, Steve Winwood, Warren Haynes, and Derek Trucks among others. His career highlights include performances at Royal Albert Hall and a Grammy Award nomination in 2013. In addition to his music career, Joe Bonamassa runs a nonprofit organization called the &quot;Keeping The Blues Alive Foundation&quot; whose mission is to further music education by funding scholarships and providing music education resources to schools in need.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoe Bonamassa was born in New Hartford, New York State. He started playing guitar at age four. His father was an avid music fan and exposed Bonamassa to records by Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. Joe was very inspired by these British blues rock records. When he was 12 years old, he had his own band called Smokin' Joe Bonamassa. The band gigged around western New York and Pennsylvania, cities such as Scranton and Buffalo, on weekends since Joe had school on weekdays. The guitar Bonamassa played, which he called &quot;Rosie,&quot; was a crimson 1972 Fender Stratocaster that Bonamassa's father bought him from a store in Utica, New York, called Big Apple Music. Bonamassa was asked to open for B.B. King at approximately twenty shows, which he did.[7] Before he reached 18 years old, Bonamassa was playing in a band called Bloodline with the sons of Miles Davis, Robby Krieger, and Berry Oakley. Although Bloodline did not become a famous act, it attracted some attention to Bonamassa's guitar chops.\n\nHis debut studio album, A New Day Yesterday was released in 2000 and features both original tunes and covers of such artists as Rory Gallagher, Jethro Tull, and Warren Haynes. The album features a guest appearance by Gregg Allman on the tune &quot;If Heartaches Were Nickels&quot; and was produced by Tom Dowd. The album reached #9 on the Billboard Blues chart.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Bonamassa saw 3 studio albums hit #1 on the Billboard Blues Charts, and all five of his solo studio albums made the top 10.\n\nIn 2009, Bonamassa fulfilled one of his childhood dreams by playing at Royal Albert Hall in London. Eric Clapton performed during the show along with Bonamassa.\n\nBonamassa's live album Beacon TheatreÃ¢â‚¬â€œLive from New York was released in 2012. The show featured one of Bonamassa's musical heroes, Paul Rodgers, formerly of the bands Free and Bad Company, as a guest.\n\nMarch 26, 2013 saw the release of his live, acoustic album An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House, which was released as a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray set.This concert marked the first time Bonamassa played a wholly acoustic show. The acoustic ensemble that performed the show was assembled with the help of Bonamassa's longtime producer, Kevin Shirley.\n\nThe concluding, three-night stand of Bonamassa's spring 2013 tour occurred at the famous Beacon Theatre in New York City.\n\nOver the summer of 2013, Bonamassa performed four shows in London featuring three different bands and, at one show, a horn section, covering four different sides of his music. Each show had a unique setlist. The shows were recorded for a DVD release and the set of DVDs was released in October, 2013 under the name &quot;Tour de Force.&quot;\n\nOn December 6, 2013, Bonamassa and Beth Hart were nominated for a Grammy Award for their 2013 collaborative album SeeSaw in the Best Blues Album category.\n\nBonamassa's album Different Shades of Blue is his first solo studio album to showcase only original songs, except for one short instrumental Jimi Hendrix cover. The Hendrix cover is a 79-second partial performance of &quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun).&quot; To write the album, Bonamassa went to Nashville and collaborated with three songwriters there: Jonathan Cain, who has written for Journey; James House, known for his work with Diamond Rio, Dwight Yoakam, and Martina McBride; and Jerry Flowers, who has written for Keith Urban. Bonamassa explained to the writers that he wasn't interested in creating three minute radio hits, but just wanted to write some serious blues rock. The recording of the album was accomplished in Las Vegas at a music studio in the Palms Hotel. On the Billboard charts, the album reached #8 on the Billboard 200, #1 on the Blues Chart, and #1 on the Indie Chart as well.\n\nNovember 8, 2014 marked exactly 25 years that Bonamassa has been playing as a professional musician.\n\n\nCollaboration with Beth Hart:\n-----------------------------\n\nBonamassa was first exposed to Beth Hart's music after seeing her play several television performances. The two would often cross paths when playing shows separately in Europe, and Bonamassa became very impressed with Hart when he caught her show at the Blue Balls festival in Lucerne, Switzerland. While recording his album Dust Bowl and listening to the expanded edition of the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! that features tracks by Ike and Tina Turner, Bonamassa became inspired to try pairing up with a female, and Beth Hart came to mind. The two musicians met up in a hotel bar in Dublin and soon Bonamassa floated the idea, which Hart accepted immediately, although she was at first under the impression that he was asking her to sing backup vocals on his next album. When she realized that his intention was for her to sing lead vocals, she said &quot;I was floored.&quot;\n\nBonamassa, Hart, and producer Kevin Shirley wrote down lists of soul songs they liked to come up with material for the album, which was named Don't Explain. The group settled on twelve songs, although only ten ended up being recorded. Bonamassa and Hart chose five songs for the album each. Some of Hart's favorite tracks on the album, included &quot;For My Friend&quot; by Bill Withers and &quot;Sinner's Prayer&quot; by Ray Charles. Bonamassa had always wanted to do versions of Brook Benton's &quot;I'll Take Care of You&quot; and &quot;Well Well&quot; written by Delaney Bramlett &amp; Bonnie Bramlett.\n\nTheir followup album, Seesaw was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Blues Album.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther Side Projects:\n--------------------\n\nBonamassa served as the guitarist for the hard rock supergroup Black Country Communion. The band released three studio albums.\n\nHe is also a member of the jazz-funk band Rock Candy Funk Party. They released their debut album, We Want Groove in 2013 and followed it up with Rock Candy Funk Party Takes New York - Live at the Iridium. The show was recorded over a three night stand at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York City. The band played Conan on February 10, 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e14a501259a53c0226fd73d9843facaf6052f3c7","amp;dn":"Joe+Bonamassa+-+Tour+De+Force%2C+Live+In+London-The+Borderline...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e14a501259a53c0226fd73d9843facaf6052f3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,74,80,18,89,165,60,2,38,253,115,217,132,63,172,175,96,82,243,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
