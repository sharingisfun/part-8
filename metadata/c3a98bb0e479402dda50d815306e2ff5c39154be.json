The network aired a total of 66 episodes (67 in syndication as the pilot is split into two episodes). Starring Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd as private detectives, the show was a mixture of drama, comedy and romance, and was considered to be one of the first successful and influential examples of comedy-drama, or dramedy, emerging as a distinct television genre.\n\nThe show's theme song was performed by jazz singer Al Jarreau and became a hit. The show is also credited with making Willis a star while providing Shepherd with a critical success after a string of lackluster projects. In 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe series revolved around cases investigated by the Blue Moon Detective Agency and its two partners, Madeline &quot;Maddie&quot; Hayes (Shepherd) and David Addison (Willis). The show, with a mix of mystery, sharp dialogue and sexual tension between its two leads, introduced Bruce Willis to the world and brought Cybill Shepherd back into the spotlight after nearly a decade-long absence. The characters were first introduced in a two-hour TV movie which preceded the show.\n\nThe show's storyline begins with the reversal of fortune of Maddie Hayes, a former model who finds herself bankrupt after her accountant embezzles all of her liquid assets. She is left saddled with several failing businesses formerly maintained as tax write-offs, one of which is the City of Angels Detective Agency, helmed by the carefree David Addison. Between the pilot episode and first episode, Addison persuades Hayes to keep the business and run it in partnership. The detective agency is renamed &quot;Blue Moon Investigations&quot; because Hayes was most famous as the spokesmodel for the (fictitious) Blue Moon Shampoo company. In many episodes, she was recognized as &quot;The Blue Moon Shampoo Girl,&quot; if not by name.\n\nIn the commentary for the season 3 DVD, Caron says that the inspiration for the series is a production of The Taming of the Shrew he saw in Central Park starring Meryl Streep and RaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºl JuliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡. The show would parody the Shakespeare play in the season three episode Atomic Shakespeare.\n\nCast and characters\n\n    * Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes: Maddie Hayes is a chic and smart former high-fashion model. Left bankrupt when her accountant embezzles all of her money, she is forced to make a living by running the detective agency she had previously owned as a tax write-off. Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Cybill Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“HawksianÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ comedy. The two had no idea what she was talking about, so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.[8]\n\n    * Bruce Willis as David Addison: David Addison is a fast-talking, fun-loving detective running the City of Angels Detective Agency. Faced with the prospect of being put out of business he convinces Maddie that they have always lost money because they were supposed to and talks her into rebranding the agency and going into business with him as her partner. Glenn Gordon Caron had to fight with ABC to put Willis in the lead role having already signed Shepherd for both the pilot and series. Caron claims he tested Willis about a third of the way through testing over 2,000 actors, knew &quot;this was the guy&quot; immediately, and had to fight through twice as many more acting tests and readings while arguing with ABC executives before receiving (initial) conditional authorization to cast Willis in the pilot. ABC, according to Caron, did not feel that anyone viewing would think there could possibly be any &quot;believable&quot; sexual tension between Shepherd and Willis.\n\n    * Allyce Beasley as Agnes DiPesto: Agnes DiPesto is the extremely loyal and quirky receptionist for the Blue Moon Detective Agency who always answers the phone in rhyme. As problems arose with getting Willis and Shepherd on screen due to personal issues, the writers started to focus on the relationship between Agnes and fellow Blue Moon employee Burt Viola. In the series finale, Agnes berates Maddie and David for not being able to figure out their nitwit relationship as the entire set is dismantled and states ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“if thereÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a God in heaven heÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ll spin Herbert and me off in our own seriesÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½.\n\n    * Curtis Armstrong as Burt Viola: Burt Viola started at Blue Moon as an employee from a temp agency. The producers brought Armstrong in based on his work in Revenge of the Nerds and Better Off Dead, hoping to expand the roles of Burt and Agnes and take some of the filming pressure off of Willis and Shepherd. As Burt begins to shine in his duties, he gets promoted to work real cases as a junior detective. Debuting in season 3, he appeared in 23 of the series' 66 episodes.\n\n    * Jack Blessing as MacGillicudy: MacGillicudy is a Blue Moon employee and became a foil for Burt Viola and a rival for AgnesÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ affections. Debuting in season 3, he appeared in 17 of the seriesÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 66 episodes.\n\n\nGuest stars\n\nIn addition to the primary cast, several notable actors appeared either as guest stars or made cameos on the series.\n\nRecurring roles:\n\n    * Charles Rocket as Richard Addison, David's brother.\n    * Eva Marie Saint and Robert Webber as Virginia and Alexander Hayes, Maddie's parents.\n    * Mark Harmon appeared in Season 3 as Sam Crawford, Maddie's romantic interest and rival with David.\n    * Brooke Adams appeared in Season 4 as Terri Knowles, a single mother for whom David volunteered as a Lamaze partner in preparation for the birth of Maddie's child.\n    * Virginia Madsen appeared in Season 5 as Annie Charnock, Maddie's cousin and a short-term romantic interest for David.\n\nOne-time Roles:\n\n    * Liz Sheridan as Selma in the pilot episode.\n    * Mary Hart as herself in the pilot episode.\n    * Tim Robbins as a hitman in the Season 1 episode &quot;Gunfight at the So-So Corral&quot;.\n    * Orson Welles as himself delivering the introduction in the Season 2 episode &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot;.\n    * Dana Delany as Jillian Armstrong in the Season 2 episode &quot;Knowing Her&quot;.\n    * David Patrick Kelly as McBride in the Season 2 episide &quot;Somewhere Under the Rainbow&quot;.\n    * Dan Lauria as the Lieutenant in the Season 2 episode &quot;Portrait of Maddie&quot;.\n    * Mark Linn-Baker as Phil West in the Season 2 episode &quot;Atlas Belched&quot;.\n    * Richard Belzer as Leonard in the Season 2 episode &quot;Twas the Episode Before Christmas&quot;.\n    * Whoopi Goldberg as Camille Brand in the Season 2 episode &quot;Camille&quot;.\n    * Judd Nelson as a Police Officer in the Season 2 episode &quot;Camille&quot;.\n    * Billy Barty as himself in the Season 2 episode &quot;Camille&quot;.\n    * Paul Sorvino as David Addison Sr. in the Season 3 episode &quot;The Son Also Rises&quot;.\n    * The Temptations as themselves in the Season 3 episode &quot;Symphony in Knocked Flat&quot;.\n    * Don King as himself in the Season 3 episode &quot;Symphony in Knocked Flat&quot;.\n    * Rick Ducommun as one of David's friends in the Season 3 episode &quot;Big Man On Mulberry Street&quot;.\n    * Sandahl Bergman appeared in a &quot;dream&quot;
