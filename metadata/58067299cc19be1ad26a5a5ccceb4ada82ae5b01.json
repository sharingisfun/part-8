The end of the American Civil War. The end of a troubled period, fraught with massacres, pillaging, chaos. Isolated at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, the small town of Promise is far from the fratricidal theatre of war, far from the terror, far from it all. Promise seems forgotten by men, by God even... But not by hell... Unsettling ambiance in the vast countryside of the  West. The arrival of Amos Laughton, a wandering preacher proclaming the imminent apocalypse and the coming of a new Messiah, disturbs the life of this small community which quickly falls under the spell of this prophet of the end times.\r\n\r\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58067299cc19be1ad26a5a5ccceb4ada82ae5b01","amp;dn":"Promise+%282013%29+%28Scanlation%29+%28phillywilly%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58067299cc19be1ad26a5a5ccceb4ada82ae5b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,6,114,153,204,25,190,26,210,106,90,92,204,235,74,218,130,174,91,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
