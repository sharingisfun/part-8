Unfortunately, I was not able to find a FLAC version of YES's song from The Ladder, so I added the version from the Relic Homeworld Community Website.\n\nEnjoy this latest release, and I suggest buying (or at least downloading) the game, please support the original company making these games/soundtracks as always!\n\n- RubiksFaQ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec3f7baad66ea648a6d2c9df2afb530a62b1c80","amp;dn":"Homeworld+Soundtrack+-+FLAC+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec3f7baad66ea648a6d2c9df2afb530a62b1c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,195,247,186,173,102,234,100,138,109,44,157,242,175,181,48,166,43,28,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
