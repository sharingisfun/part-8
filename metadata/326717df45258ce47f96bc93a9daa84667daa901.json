First recordings were made in the early 1960s, and, since Bachir Attar took the helm of this group in 1982, there have been two distinct bands of Master Musicians. Expansion and exposure outside of Morocco came about mainly because the Master Musicians have been championed in the last half-century by a long list of taste-making western pop stars, filmmakers, jazz musicians, journalists, artists, and literary luminaries such as Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Donovan, Sonic YouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lee Ranaldo, Augusta Palmer, Mark and Erik Hertado, Ornette Coleman, rock critic Robert Palmer, Brion Gysin, William S. Burroughs, and Paul Bowles.\n\nThe performance heard on Jajouka Live Vol. 1 was, in fact, part of a tribute to Paul Bowles. Recorded in 2007 at the Centro Cultural de BelÃƒÂ©m in Lisbon, Portugal on the final night of a week long series of concerts, Live Vol. 1 is also the debut release on Jajouka Records, which is owned and operated by Bachir Attar and the Master Musicians. Produced by Bachir Attar &amp; Michael Gassert, this album is the first Bachir Attar-led Master MusiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ release since 2000Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s electronica-inflected Master Musicians of Jajouka Featuring Bachir Attar, and is a collection of new and never before released songs in the more traditional and timeless Sufi trance sound specific to Jajouka.\n\n1 \tIntro \t\n2 \tJoal Fibladi Joal \t\n3 \tBoujeloud Dancing With Kandisha \t\n4 \tDouble Medahey \t\n5 \tIf The Moon Loves You \t\n6 \tLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Aita \t\n7       Habibi Galouja \t\n8 \tHlallia\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Master-Musicians-of-Jajouka-Jajouka-Live-Vol-1/release/2611027&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Master-Musicians-of-Jajouka-Jajouka-Live-Vol-1/release/2611027&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326717df45258ce47f96bc93a9daa84667daa901","amp;dn":"The+Master+Musicians+of+Jajouka+-+Live+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326717df45258ce47f96bc93a9daa84667daa901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,103,23,223,69,37,140,228,127,150,188,147,169,218,168,70,103,218,169,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
