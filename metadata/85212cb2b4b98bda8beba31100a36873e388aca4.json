As with other Call of Duty games, focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action. As a private new to war in America's most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First, and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.\n\nPlayers will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea and air missions in Africa, Sicily and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars and half-tracks. Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Cinematic Intensity as Never Before on Consoles: The hallmark cinematic \n  intensity of Call of Duty returns with a more complete gameplay experience than \n  ever. Experience a wide variety of missions on land, sea, and in the air, with \n  the aid of over three dozen authentic American, Italian, French, and German \n  weapons. Charge into battle together as Allied and Axis planes duel overhead,\n  artillery explosions shake the ground and choke the air, and bullets and \n  shrapnel streak past you and your squadmates. Experience war-torn Europe and \n  Africa, from the blistering desert expanses of Tunisia and Libya to the \n  beautiful yet deadly countrysides of Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany. \n\n* Live a soldier's story, deeper than any you've experienced before: You are \n  thrust into the role and story of a member of The Big Red One, AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most \n  heroic and decorated infantry division. Experience the camaraderie of a single \n  tight-knit army squad, bound together through the chaos of battle over the \n  course of the entire game. Yes, you will suffer casualties; you must not \n  suffer defeat. \n\n* Know your squad like never before: Through all-new AI and animation, your allies\n (and your enemies) just got a lot smarter. Your squad will now make better use of\n  environmental cover and tactical Maneuvers, such as flanking, envelopment, and\n  fire-and-maneuver behaviors. Hear your allies reacting to the events on the \n  battlefield with contextually accurate battle chatter. \n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media\nisn't working.\n\n\nIf using DVD+R then booktype to DVD-ROM \n(If your mod-chip, or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85212cb2b4b98bda8beba31100a36873e388aca4","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+2+-+Big+Red+One+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85212cb2b4b98bda8beba31100a36873e388aca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,33,44,178,180,185,139,218,139,235,163,17,0,163,104,115,227,136,172,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
