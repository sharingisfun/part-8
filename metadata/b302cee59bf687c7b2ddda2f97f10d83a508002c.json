Released during a time where shooters were becoming increasingly realistic and more concerned with &quot;authenticity&quot;, Serious Sam offered up traditional, Quake-style shooting. However, the more modern technology of the time allowed for a new take on that classic formula. Closed-in corridors are mostly replaced with wide-open environments, small groups of enemies are replaced by dozens attacking at any given time, and there are many hidden areas and treasures to find, often in obscure and counter-intuitive locations. Combat makes up most of the games, with Sam's only help being NETRICSA (NEuro-TRonically Implanted Combat Situation Analyser), an advanced computer AI surgically implanted into his skull. NETRICSA serves as an in-game strategy guide, cataloguing encountered enemies and weapons, and at the same time providing bits about the background story and hints on how to progress. Ammunition and weapons are plentiful, and guns, for the most part, do not need to be reloaded. Enemy designs are whimsical and often take inspiration from mythology and fantasy, and include anything from flying harpies, to giant bipedal cybernetic monsters, to headless suicide-bombers.\n\nSerious Sam features cooperative gameplay, something not commonly seen in modern PC first-person shooters. Besides network/online play, Serious Sam also allows for split screen action supporting up to 4 players and this is an even rarer multiplayer feature for PC games these days\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*****Serious Sam: The First Encounter:\nThe First Encounter was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. The First Encounter was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the value of other games in the genre.\n\nThe game introduction reveals what happened before the game actually takes place: in ancient times, Earth was involved in a conflict between Mental and the Sirians, an alien race that left many of its artifacts to be found by humanity. In the 22nd century Mental's forces return to Earth hell-bent on eradicating humankind: as a last resort the usage of the &quot;Time Lock&quot; is decided: this Sirian device can send back through time a single individual who can, hopefully, defeat Mental and alter the course of history. Because of his bravery in fighting the monsters, Sam &quot;Serious&quot; Stone is chosen to use the &quot;Time Lock&quot;. As the game opens, Sam appears in Ancient Egypt. He travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, all the way fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him, make up most of the story of The First Encounter. During his wandering, Sam is able to activate a hidden Sirian communicator, located in Luxor, that summons to Earth a starship from the depths of space. Sam goes to the Great Pyramid for a rendezvous with the ship and, after a titanic battle against Mental's general Ugh Zan III, he is whisked on-board the Sirian starship.\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*****Serious Sam: The Second Encounter:\nThe Second Encounter starts where the previous chapter left off, with Sam travelling to Sirius on the starship. Unfortunately Sam's vehicle is accidentally hit by the &quot;Croteam crate-bus&quot; and plummets down to Earth's surface. Serious Sam crash lands in Central America in the Mayan age. However not all is lost, since the Sirians left a back-up ship on Earth. Since this vehicle is located in a different age from the one Sam finds himself, the hero has to uncover the locations of a number of Sirian time-gates that will help him reach his destination. With this objective, Sam storms through Ancient Mesoamerica, then travels to Ancient Mesopotamia and finally to Medieval Europe where the starship is located. On his way, Sam battles two of Mental's timelock guardians: the spirit named Kukulkan the Wind God and a biomechanical creature, the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts Mordekai The Summoner, the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the Holy Grail. After a time-consuming battle with Mordekai's minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail, followed by his confession of his sins in a booth... to Mental, during which he reassures Mental that &quot;he's coming to get him.&quot;\n\nOther than the more varied locations, The Second Encounter features some additional weaponsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a chainsaw, a flamethrower, a sniper rifle, and the powerful Serious BombÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a number of new monsters that Sam has to face.\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b302cee59bf687c7b2ddda2f97f10d83a508002c","amp;dn":"Serious+Sam+First+n+Second+Encounter%28Latest+Patches%29OnlinePlayab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b302cee59bf687c7b2ddda2f97f10d83a508002c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,2,206,229,155,246,135,199,178,221,218,47,151,241,13,131,165,8,0,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
