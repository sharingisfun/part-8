You'll also learn to take advantage of Dreamweaver's new ability to simultaneously design sites for a variety of screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. If you're new to Dreamweaver and web design, you'll learn to create your first Web site, add text, style and lay out page content, manage styles, work with links, incorporate images, media, tables, forms, design site navigation, and so much more. If you're an experienced user, you'll find this a convenient reference to the new features of Dreamweaver CS6.\n\nIncludes Free eBook and Video Access\nIn addition to concise, step-by-step explanations of core tools and tasks, with plenty of helpful screen shots to keep you on track as you work, Adobe Dreamweaver CS6: Visual QuickStart Guide includes an hour-long HD video and eBook.

I haven't found a way to remove this without having the password, so Acrobat Pro won't let you edit the document, copy/extract single pages, or change the permissions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c0d91ad427fbc7db87ebf5d954f6cb584a4e499","amp;dn":"Dreamweaver+CS6+Visual+QuickStart+Guide+%2B+Video+QuickStart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c0d91ad427fbc7db87ebf5d954f6cb584a4e499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,13,145,173,66,127,188,125,184,126,191,93,149,79,108,181,132,164,228,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
