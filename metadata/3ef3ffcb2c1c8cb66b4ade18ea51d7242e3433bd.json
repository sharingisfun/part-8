It covers the areas of counterparty risk measurement, pricing (CVA), hedging, collateralization, stress testing, back testing and integration into economic capital frameworks. Various new ideas, directions and models are discussed by a group of seasoned experts. The content of the book is even more relevant in light of the recent proposals of the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision for the changes in the regulatory capital on counterparty risks.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface\n\nSection 1: Counterparty risk measurement and management\n\nCh. 1 Systemic Counterparty Credit Risk Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aaron Brown\n\nCh. 2 Collateralized Credit Exposure - Michael Pykhtin\n\nCh. 3 Efficient Derivation of Counterparty Exposure at Default for Trading Book Credit Risk Economic Capital - David Rowe, Dan Travers and Phillip Koop\n\nCh. 4 Effective Enterprise-wide Collateral Management - Darren Measures\n\nCh. 5 Evolution of the US Legal Framework for Counterparty Risk Mitigation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lauren Teigland-Hunt\n\nSection 2: Counterparty risk pricing and hedging\n\nCh. 6 Pricing and Hedging Counterparty Risk: Lessons Re-Learned?
