Discover the excitement of the championship in three differents categories (Superstock, WSS, SBK) and challenge the real drivers on their bikes on the official circuits. One of the main goals of SBKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«2011 is to overtake the great overall graphics of SBKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«X by putting on the best show ever seen on two wheels on console and PC. Now you can really feel the difference, with a larger amount of variety, greater fluidity in the rider animations and a noticeable increase in the polygon models that make up each circuit. Enjoy the latest EmotionFX support, which improves all animations and creates a way to have more eye candy in the movements of the riders! Thanks to this set of development tools, Milestone has managed to perfect every single movement of the rider, creating race situations that are always different and closer to reality. The physics has been revised and refined, and is now supported by over 100 different animations, making for highly realistic rider movements, both while racing and in the now fully revised falls.\n\n\nCustomize the layout of the events by choosing among three different presets: Real, Qualify &amp; Race, Race only. Now you can finally create your own event, defining, step-by-step, the set-up of the qualifying sessions, the tests and the official races. Compete with your friends through the online modes (up to 16 players) and try to raise the ranking to reach the top! You can also create a personal online championship, choosing the number of participants and the order of the races.\n\n\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ecbd97a5328d8148ca2cae77e1fda325ff724cf","amp;dn":"SBK.Superbike.World.Championship.2011-RELOADEDSBK.Superbike.Worl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ecbd97a5328d8148ca2cae77e1fda325ff724cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,203,217,122,83,40,216,20,140,162,202,231,126,31,218,50,95,247,36,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
