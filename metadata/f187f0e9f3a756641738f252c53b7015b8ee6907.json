Writer-director Jean-Pierre Melville uses his priest protagonist (Jean-Paul Belmondo) to chronicle the lives of the residents of the small occupied town, from those who fight in the Resistance to those who simply want to survive. The central story explores the sexual tension between priest and parishioner, with an unusually frank approach for the early 1960s. Melville's detailed, observant portrait imbues the film with a unique credibility, and Belmondo gives a sexy, charismatic performance that enhances the film's thematic contrasts. LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on Morin is also uncommon for the early 1960s in its passionate argument against anti-Semitism. Few films before or after have examined spirituality and religion in so convincing a manner. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Leon Morin Pretre.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.33 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 702 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate : 1 503 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.245\n      Stream size : 1.18 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 52mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Video delay : 11ms\n      Stream size : 154 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.40 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055082/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055082/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nFrom KG by crasus, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f187f0e9f3a756641738f252c53b7015b8ee6907","amp;dn":"Jean-Pierre+Melville+-+Leon+Morin+Pretre+%281961%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f187f0e9f3a756641738f252c53b7015b8ee6907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,135,240,233,243,167,86,100,23,56,242,82,197,59,112,21,184,238,105,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
