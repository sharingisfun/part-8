A verdade, porÃƒÂ©m, ÃƒÂ© que hÃƒÂ¡ anos ele vive de amores por Armando, o seu massagista!\n\nIn Switzerland, at the whim of the court, every citizen can be assigned a live-in foster child.\nWhen brilliant university professor and part-time author Jean-Pierre (Jean-Claude Brialy) learns from the local judge that he will henceforth be responsible for Antoine, a recalcitrant teenager (Julien Bravo), disaster looms. To the eyes of the world (and the justice system), Jean-Pierre is happily married to a woman. The truth, however, is that for years he has been spinning out loveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet dream with Armando, his masseur! Since coming out is definitely not an option, Jean-Pierre tries by all possible means to discourage the judge, but this only triggers a prickly investigation into his suitability.\nWith only one solution to avoid losing face, he gets back in touch with Alice (Sabine Haudepin), his wife, or rather, the friend he once married as a favor. But when young Antoine takes the initiative and moves in, Jean-PierreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life goes into meltdown. Faced with a hysterical Armando, a depressive Alice and a rather charming kid, Jean-Pierre attempts - with great difficulty - to salvage something from the maelstrom of misunderstandings wreaking havoc on his private life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8228c448799723203950869856baed4501d8d39a","amp;dn":"As+Luck+Would+Have+It+2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8228c448799723203950869856baed4501d8d39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,40,196,72,121,151,35,32,57,80,134,152,86,186,237,69,1,216,211,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
