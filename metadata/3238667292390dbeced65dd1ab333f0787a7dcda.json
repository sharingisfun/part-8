Unless you refuse to listen to any music after Beethoven, you most certainly have heard this unit in action. Best yet, this is the first time this hardware unit has been available in plugin format.\n\nWhy did we model this unit?\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the deal. It seems like everybody is modeling hardware these days, but we wanted to do something a little different. We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to model any hardware units that have been done a million times. We wanted to do something that had never been done before but has been an icon in the recording industry, and the only way to do that was to team up with producer/mixer David Bendeth. He just happened to have a few of these in his rack, so he sent us one to pour over.\n\nUnless you stopped listening to music after Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johnny B GoodeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ then you have most definitely heard this hardware unit many many times. Think of Led Zeppelin drums.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nN0TES\n50th RELEASE!\nWE HOPE THiS TO BE JUST THE FiRST OF MANY MiLESTONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGREETZ!\nALL PRESENT, PAST &amp; FUTURE TEAMS AND iNDs\nWHO MADE AUDiO WAREZ HiSTORY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSUPPORT GOOD DEVS WHO DON'T TORTURE USERS\nWiTH SHiTTY PROTECTiONS AND BUY WHAT YOU USE AND LiKE!\n\nNFO v.1.1 - 09.2014\n- C0ME T0 THE DARK SiDE -\n- HEXWARS -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1337x.to - demonoid.pw - fenopy.se - flashtorrents.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (12)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3238667292390dbeced65dd1ab333f0787a7dcda","amp;dn":"Boz+Digital+Labs+-+Plus10db+Bundle+v1.0.1+OS+X+%5BHEXWARS%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3238667292390dbeced65dd1ab333f0787a7dcda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,56,102,114,146,57,13,190,206,214,93,209,171,51,63,7,135,167,220,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
