It costs 20 dollars though. However, I'm here to save the day by bringing you the add-on completely free!\n\nInfo on this pack here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/material/samurai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/material/samurai&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis pack contains:\nAnimations: 11 files\nBattlers: 168 files - 84 unique files (theres 2 of each battler in here, normal image, then a mirrored image)\nCharacters: 26 files\nFaces: 13 files\nSystem: 11 files\nThen theres also a folder called Feel_Free_To_Modify which contains 145 files.\n\nTotal Size: 77mb\n\nIt also contains &quot;launcher.exe&quot;. Using this tool you can quickly add all the new graphics to your project. Simply browse for your project folder and install the graphics you want. Its all in the readme. Everytime you go to use this tool, you must click the &quot;READ ME FIRST&quot; button. Kind of annoying. Or you can just manually add the graphics you desire.\n\nIf you would like a direct download to this instead of using the torrent, follow this link:\n\nAliases:\ngame_guy\ngameguy27\nRonnie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965a4375ac6e646c2cfbccfba375fefc14c59612","amp;dn":"RPG+Maker+VX+Samurai+RTP+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965a4375ac6e646c2cfbccfba375fefc14c59612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,90,67,117,172,110,100,108,44,251,204,251,163,117,254,252,20,197,150,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
