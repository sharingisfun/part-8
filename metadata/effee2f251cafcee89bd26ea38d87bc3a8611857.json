M. H. Moll\nChurchill Livingstone | 1995 | ISBN 0-443-04614-X | PDF | 158 pages | 10.1 mb\n\nIn general, rheumatology is a speciality eminently suited to pictorial representation. Surface colour changes and alterations in the morphology of the limbs and trunk combine to form a myriad of unique clinical patterns. Once seen, these are rarely forgotten.\nA concise pictorial overview of rheumatology, in the handy pocket-size Colour Guide format. Topics are presented in double-page spreads, with text on the left and illustrations on the right. High quality colour images, largely clinical photographs, demonstrate examples of the topic under discussion and the text provides a synoptic account to enhance the illustrations. The text is concise but relevant and wherever possible uses a standard set of headings (for example, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, prognosis.) The impressive collection of colour images allows readers access to a range of clinical examples they might not otherwise see in everyday practice. The Colour Guides titles have no competition, with their combination of small size, concise text, and lavish use of colour images, they provide an inexpensive but invaluable pocket reference for students and doctors alike. \n\nFeatures: \n* A concise pictorial overview of rheumatology \n* Presented in the handy pocket-size Colour Guide format \n* High quality colour images accompany synoptic text \n* Double page spreads give fast access to vital information \n* Gives reader access to a wide range of clinical examples at a low cost\n\nCONTENTS\nRheumatoid Arthritis and Allied Conditions\nSpondarthritides\nSystemic Connective Tissue Disorders \nDegenerative Disorders\nCrystal Deposition Disease\nInfective Arthritides\nRheumatic Manifestations of Systemic Conditions\nMetabolic Bone Disease\nJuvenile Rheumatoid Disorders\nMiscellaneous Conditions\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:effee2f251cafcee89bd26ea38d87bc3a8611857","amp;dn":"Rheumatology+%28Colour+Guide%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"effee2f251cafcee89bd26ea38d87bc3a8611857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,254,226,242,81,202,252,238,137,189,38,234,56,216,123,195,168,97,24,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
