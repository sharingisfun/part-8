The Orlando Consort is an excellent ensemble of four male voices who have been recording Renaissance music for decades. Curiously, this release of theirs didn't stay on the shelves very long, but like all the others it's extremely well researched and performed.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nFull texts and translations enclosed. You can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or just looking in this regularly updated thread:\r\n \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04d296b7e4e89da899b742e6357e0f9caaa17fc","amp;dn":"Music%2C+Feasting+in+Renaissance+Europe+-+Orlando+Csrt+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04d296b7e4e89da899b742e6357e0f9caaa17fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,77,41,107,126,78,137,218,137,155,116,46,99,87,224,249,202,170,23,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
