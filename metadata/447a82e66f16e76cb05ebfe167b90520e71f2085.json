Certainly at the time of release, it was almost unprecedented for an artist to release a live concert recording of previously unreleased material. Long out of print on vinyl, still unavailable on CD in the early 21st century and widely bootlegged, the album is considered to be the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of all Neil Young albums.\nThe Time Fades Away tour took place in the aftermath of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten's death. Whitten had been trying to kick a heroin habit and was fired by Young, who gave him an airline ticket home and fifty dollars. The next day Whitten was dead of an overdose and Young was devastated by the news. As the stress of the tour and grief over Whitten's death sank in, Young's concerts became more and more ragged and raw.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:36 \nRecorded at The Myriad, Oklahoma City (March 1, 1973)\n2 &quot;Journey Through the Past&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19 \nRecorded at Public Hall, Cleveland (February 11, 1973)\n3 &quot;Yonder Stands the Sinner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17 \nRecorded at Seattle Center Coliseum, Seattle (March 17, 1973)\n4 &quot;L.A.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 \nRecorded at The Myriad, Oklahoma City (March 1, 1973)\n5 &quot;Love in Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:58 \nRecorded at Royce Hall, UCLA (January 30, 1971)\n6   &quot;Don't Be Denied&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16 \nRecorded at Memorial Auditorium, Phoenix (March 28, 1973)\n7 &quot;The Bridge&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05 \nRecorded at Memorial Auditorium, Sacramento (April 1, 1973)\n8 &quot;Last Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:47 \nRecorded at Sports Arena, San Diego (March 29, 1973)\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nNeil Young ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar, piano, harmonica, vocals\nBen Keith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pedal steel, harmony vocals (on tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 )\nJack Nitzsche ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano (on tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 )\nJohnny Barbata ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (on tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 )\nTim Drummond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (on tracks 1, 3, 6, 8 )\nJoe Yankee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass (on track 4)\nDavid Crosby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ rhythm guitar, backing vocals (on tracks 3, 8 )\nGraham Nash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals (on track 8 )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447a82e66f16e76cb05ebfe167b90520e71f2085","amp;dn":"Neil+Young++Time+Fades+Away+%28rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447a82e66f16e76cb05ebfe167b90520e71f2085","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,122,130,230,111,22,231,108,176,94,191,225,103,185,5,32,231,31,32,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
