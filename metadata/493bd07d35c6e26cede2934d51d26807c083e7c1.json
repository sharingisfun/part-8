His account is at once romantic and packed with facts, conjuring up the atmosphere of the canals, bridges and sunlit squares, the churches and the markets, the fiestas and the flowers. He leads us through the history of the city, from the first refugees arriving in the mists of the lagoon in the fourth century to the rise of a great mercantile state and a trading empire, the wars against Napoleon and the tourist invasions of today. Everything is here: the merchants on the Rialto and the Jews in the ghetto; the mosaics of St Mark's and the glass blowers of Murano; the carnival masks and the sad colonies of lepers; and, the doges and the destitute and the artists with their passion for colour and form - Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Tiepolo. There are wars and sieges, scandals and seductions, fountains playing in deserted squares and crowds thronging the markets. And there is a dark undertone too, of shadowy corners and dead ends, prisons and punishment. The language and way of thinking of the Venetians sets them aside from the rest of Italy. They are an island people, linked to the sea and to the tides rather than the land. 'The moon rules Venice', Ackroyd writes: 'It is built on ocean shells and ocean ground; it has the aspect of infinity. It is the floating world...changing and variable and accidental. 'This book, like a magic gondola, transports its readers to that sensual, surprising realm. We could have no better guide - reading Ackroyd's Venice is, in itself, a glorious journey and the perfect holiday.\n\nJames H.S. McGregor - Venice From the Ground Up\n\nVenice came to life on spongy mudflats at the edge of the habitable world. Protected in a tidal estuary from barbarian invaders and Byzantine overlords, the fishermen, salt gatherers, and traders who settled there crafted an amphibious way of life unlike anything the Roman Empire had ever known. In an astonishing feat of narrative history, James H. S. McGregor recreates this world-turned-upside-down, with its waterways rather than roads, its boats tethered alongside dwellings, and its livelihood harvested from the sea.\n\nMcGregor begins with the river currents that poured into the shallow Lagoon, carving channels in its bed and depositing islands of silt. He then describes the imaginative responses of Venetians to the demands and opportunities of this harsh environmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½transforming the channels into canals, reclaiming salt marshes for the construction of massive churches, erecting a thriving marketplace and stately palaces along the Grand Canal. Through McGregorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eyes, we witness the flowering of VeniceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s restless creativity in the elaborate mosaics of St. MarkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soaring basilica, the expressive paintings in smaller neighborhood churches, and the colorful religious festivalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but also in theatrical productions, gambling casinos, and masked revelry, which reveal the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s less pious and orderly face.\n\nMcGregor tells his unique history of Venice by drawing on a crumbling, tide-threatened cityscape and a treasure-trove of art that can still be seen in place today. The narrative follows both a chronological and geographical organization, so that readers can trace the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s evolution chapter by chapter and visitors can explore it district by district on foot and by boat. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493bd07d35c6e26cede2934d51d26807c083e7c1","amp;dn":"Peter+Ackroyd+-++Venice%3A+Pure+City++%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493bd07d35c6e26cede2934d51d26807c083e7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,59,208,125,53,198,226,108,237,226,147,77,81,210,104,7,192,131,231,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
