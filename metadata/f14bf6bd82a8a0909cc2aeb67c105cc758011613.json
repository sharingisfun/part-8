The book is divided into three parts: Fundamentals Revisited, Building on Fundamentals, and Beyond the Fundamentals. Part I: Fundamentals Revisited reviews the salient features of an undergraduate course, introducing concepts essential to reactor design, such as mixing, unsteady-state operations, multiple steady states, and complex reactions.\n\nPart II: Building on Fundamentals is devoted to &quot;skill building,&quot; particularly in the area of catalysis and catalytic reactions. It covers chemical thermodynamics, emphasizing the thermodynamics of adsorption and complex reactions; the fundamentals of chemical kinetics, with special emphasis on microkinetic analysis; and heat and mass transfer effects in catalysis, including transport between phases, transfer across interfaces, and effects of external heat and mass transfer. It also contains a chapter that provides readers with tools for making accurate kinetic measurements and analyzing the data obtained.\n\nPart III: Beyond the Fundamentals presents material not commonly covered in textbooks, addressing aspects of reactors involving more than one phase. It discusses solid catalyzed fluid-phase reactions in fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors, gasÃ¢â‚¬â€œsolid noncatalytic reactions, reactions involving at least one liquid phase (gasÃ¢â‚¬â€œliquid and liquidÃ¢â‚¬â€œliquid), and multiphase reactions. This section also describes membrane-assisted reactor engineering, combo reactors, homogeneous catalysis, and phase-transfer catalysis. The final chapter provides a perspective on future trends in reaction engineering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14bf6bd82a8a0909cc2aeb67c105cc758011613","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reaction+Engineering%2C+Beyond+the+Fundamentals+%5BPDF%5D+%5BSt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14bf6bd82a8a0909cc2aeb67c105cc758011613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,75,246,189,130,168,160,144,156,194,174,182,124,16,92,199,88,1,22,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
