This is best viewed in between s4e11 and s4e12. Since the parts are all strung together some unneeded establishing shots were cut as were some overlapping clips.\n\nThis is the fifth (and final?) edit and encode of Battlestar Galactica's The Face of the Enemy 10 webisode series. This new version5 used the very best source: the newly available Japanese Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Blu-ray Box Set and compared to previous fanedits was encoded at a higher bitrate using the placebo profile.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS: a very, very special thanks to the poster of this Blu-Ray source. Thank you!!!\n\nv5 improvements over v4:\n* New 1080i 14.22Mbps AVC video, stereo 640Kbps AC3 audio source from Japanese Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Blu-ray Box Set\n* final video encode was 2500Kbps, 2-pass, placebo\n* resolution is better than the previous 720p low bit-rate streaming source\n* colors are much better than the previous source\n\nTechnical notes:\nThe source was high bitrate 1080i AVC Blu-Ray video which looks great compared to the older 720p web streaming source.\n\nThe top, left and right edges had tiny black bars and the bottom edge had a very noticeable partial black bar: no black bar for the left few hundred pixels then a black bar for the rest of the bottom edge. In the process of trimming the black bars and maintaining the aspect ratio a final resolution of 1904x1064 was produced.\n\nSource:\nvideo: AVC, 14513-14626Kbps, 1920x1080i (16:9), 29.970fps\naudio: AC3, 640Kbps, 48.0KHz, 2 channels\n\nFFmpeg 64-bit built 2015.01.15: convert Source files to Editing files, video re-encoded, audio passthrough\n\nEditing:\nvideo: MPEG-2V, 20816-20845Kbps, 1920x1080p (16:9), 29.970fps\naudio: AC3, 640Kbps, 48.0KHz, 2 channels\n\nEditing Output: convert clips on 4 timelines to single file, video passthrough, audio re-encoded\nvideo: MPEG-2V, 19757Kbps, 1920x1080p (16:9), 29.970fps\naudio: AC3, 384Kbps, 48.0KHz, 2 channels\n\nHandbrake 0.9.9: convert Editing Output to Final Output, video/audio re-encoded\n\nPlease check out other Battlestar Galactica posts plus Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, DC Comics, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \n &lt;a href=&quot; https://kickass.so/user/bsg4you/uploads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://kickass.so/user/bsg4you/uploads/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe96e64a6838ac669d235071a14a97cad4c52b69","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+Face+Of+The+Enemy+Fanedit+v5+BluRay+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe96e64a6838ac669d235071a14a97cad4c52b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,150,230,74,104,56,172,102,157,35,80,113,161,74,151,202,212,197,43,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
