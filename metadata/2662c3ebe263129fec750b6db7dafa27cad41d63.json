On September 9 the band follow-up that box set with the release of Spring 1990 (The Other One) featuring 23-CDs worth of music from that same tour.\n\nThe music on the box set was recorded by long-time Grateful Dead audio engineer John Cutler and mixed from the master 24-track analog tapes by Jeffrey Norman at Bob WeirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TRI Studios. David Glasser then mastered the music to HDCD specs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When we produced the first Spring 1990 box in 2012, there were a lot of tough choices to make about what shows to omit from that box. However, we knew weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do this second box someday, so the choices of omission were easier to digest,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Grateful Dead archivist David Lemieux in a press release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to complete the picture the first box painted with music thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every bit as good, and in some cases surpasses, the six shows in the original box. These are eight extremely high- level Dead shows, each and every one of which would make a terrific CD releases. It only seemed fitting that in the face of such an abundance of quality Dead, we should release it all at once.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dead.net/store/1990s/spring-1990-other-one-box&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dead.net/store/1990s/spring-1990-other-one-box&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2662c3ebe263129fec750b6db7dafa27cad41d63","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+23CD+Box+Spring+1990+The+Other+One+%282014%29+Beolab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2662c3ebe263129fec750b6db7dafa27cad41d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,98,195,235,226,99,18,159,236,117,11,109,183,218,250,39,202,212,29,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
