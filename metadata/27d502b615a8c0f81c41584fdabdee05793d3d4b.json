Perhaps too determined. \n\nThe Bedford Incident is a 1965 British-American Cold War film starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, and co-produced by Richard Widmark. The cast also features James MacArthur, Martin Balsam, Wally Cox and Eric Portman, as well as early appearances by Donald Sutherland and Ed Bishop. The screenplay by James Poe is based on the 1963 book by Mark Rascovich, which was patterned after Herman Melville\\\\\\'s Moby-Dick.\n\nThe film was directed by James B. Harris, who up to that time was best known as Stanley Kubrick\\\\\\'s producer. Harris had recently split from a nine-year partnership with Kubrick. Just after the split, Kubrick would make Dr. Strangelove (1964), which raises similar issues to The Bedford Incident.\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: Japanese, French, Korean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27d502b615a8c0f81c41584fdabdee05793d3d4b","amp;dn":"The+Bedford+Incident+-+1965","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27d502b615a8c0f81c41584fdabdee05793d3d4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,213,2,182,21,168,192,248,28,65,88,79,218,189,238,5,121,61,61,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
