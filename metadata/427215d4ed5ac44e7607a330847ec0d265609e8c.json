Players can choose from 50 levels and 3 gameplay modes. New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\n    Inventor Mode: Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines â€” gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more.\r\n    Time Challenge Mode: If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here. This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it.\r\n    Move Challenge Mode: Take your time and plan ahead. Every click counts when you only get ten moves to find a solution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:427215d4ed5ac44e7607a330847ec0d265609e8c","amp;dn":"Cogs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"427215d4ed5ac44e7607a330847ec0d265609e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,114,21,212,237,90,196,78,118,7,163,48,132,126,192,210,101,96,158,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
