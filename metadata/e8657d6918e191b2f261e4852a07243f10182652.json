Sangeetha et al. (AAP, 2017).pdf\r\n\r\nWith focus on the practical use of modern biotechnology for environmental sustainability, this book provides a thoughtful overview of molecular aspects of environmental studies to create a new awareness of fundamental biological processes and sustainable ecological concerns. It covers the latest research by prominent scientists in modern biology and delineates recent and prospective applications in the sub-areas of environmental biotechnology with special focus on the biodegradation of toxic pollutants, bioremediation of contaminated environments, and bioconversion of organic wastes toward a green economy and sustainable future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8657d6918e191b2f261e4852a07243f10182652","amp;dn":"Environmental+Biotechnology+-+Biodegradation%2C+Bioremediation%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8657d6918e191b2f261e4852a07243f10182652","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,101,125,105,24,225,145,178,242,97,228,133,42,7,36,63,16,24,38,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
