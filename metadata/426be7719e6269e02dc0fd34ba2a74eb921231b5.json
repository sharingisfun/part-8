His poetry - universally acknowledged as a high point of modernist verse - has sometimes been overshadowed by his political speech, which was so controversial that it caused him to be thrown in an iron cage and later an insane asylum.  Ever since, Pound's political views have drawn more condemnation than comprehension, but they are vital reading for those who care about America's fate, and hope for it a better future than to serve as the military wing of... well, let us say, of interest groups whose interests are not those of the American people.\n\nThis torrent includes a large collection of recordings of Pound reading his poetry and Pound's recording &quot;for the record&quot; on his &quot;four steps&quot; of political development; it also contains the following texts:\n\nPOETRY AND LITERARY WRITINGS\nThe Cantos\nCathay\nA Quinzaine for this Yule\nSonnets and Ballate of Guido Cavalcanti\nExultations\nABC of Reading\nCertain Noble Plays of Japan\nInstigations\nLustra\nPavannes and Divisions\nPersonae\nPoems 1918-1921\nHugh Selwyn Mauberly\nProvenca\nQuia Pauper Amavi\nRipostes\nThe Spirit of Romance\nUmbra\n\nPOLITICAL WRITINGS\n&quot;Ezra Pound Speaking&quot; - a collection of Pound's radio broadcasts \nPound's essay on the Jefferson-Adams Correspondence\nAmerica, Roosevelt, and the Causes of the Present War\nAn Introduction to the Economic Nature of the United States\nSocial Credit\nWhat is Money For?\ntexts of some individual radio broadcasts\n\nWRITINGS ABOUT POUND\nAn essay by T.S.
