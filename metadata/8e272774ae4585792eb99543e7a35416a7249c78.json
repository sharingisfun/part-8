There has been a lot of scientific advances in the radiology, pathology and risk assessment of benign breast lesions since the publication of the first edition. The first edition concentrated on screen-detected lesions, which has been rectified. New symptomatic and screen-detected lesions are discussed in the second edition and include: mastitis and breast abscess, idiopathic granulomatous mastitis, diabetic mastopathy, phyllodes tumour, gynaecomastia and pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. The chapters on columnar cell lesions and mucocele-like lesions have been extensively updated. Where applicable, genetic analysis of the benign lesions which in breast cancer is becoming part of personalised medicine has been included. The book includes detailed analysis of the main models such as the Gail Model used to assess the subsequent risk of breast cancer in individuals. The current trend in the management of all cancers is preventative. Screening mammography detects early curable cancers as well as indeterminate lesions. These indeterminate mammographic lesions are invariably pathologically benign. The author collated important benign lesions and based on peer-reviewed publications documented the relative risk of subsequent cancer to allow the patient and the clinician to institute preventative measures where possible. This book therefore will be an essential part of multidisciplinary management of patients with symptomatic and screen-detected benign breast lesions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e272774ae4585792eb99543e7a35416a7249c78","amp;dn":"Benign+Breast+Diseases%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e272774ae4585792eb99543e7a35416a7249c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,39,39,116,174,69,133,121,46,185,149,67,231,163,84,22,167,36,156,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
