In L.A. only a few weeks and still living in his car, he answered a want ad for a bass player placed by someone who identified himself only as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlash.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Soon after, the most dangerous band in the world was born. Guns NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses went on to sell more than 100 million albums worldwide. \nIn It's So Easy, Duff recounts GNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unlikely trajectory to a string of multiplatinum albums, sold-out stadium concerts, and global acclaim. But that kind of glory can take its toll, and it didÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ultimatelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on Duff, as well as on the band itself. As GNÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢R began to splinter, Duff felt that he himself was done, too. But his near death as a direct result of alcoholism proved to be his watershed, the turning point that led to his unique path to sobriety and the unexpected choices he has made for himself since. In a voice that is as honest as it is indelibly his own, DuffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one of rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s smartest and most articulate personalitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½takes readers on his harrowing journey through the dark heart of one of the most notorious bands in rock-and-roll history and out the other side.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\nDuff McKagan is the former bass player for and founding member of Guns NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roses.
