Dark, cynical, and humorous, the books offer an adventure into the Nightside, where classic pulp PI novels blend with fantasy and science fiction.\n\nThe novels also contain references to various folklore and iconic world literature.\n\nThe series itself takes place in a fictional inner city area of London known as the Nightside. The Nightside experiences perpetual night &quot;it's always 3am&quot;. The Nightside itself is contained within London, yet is significantly larger than London itself. Though access to the Nightside is hidden, it does experience a steady stream of tourists from the &quot;normal world&quot;.\n\n\n                    Book 01 - Something From the Nightside\n\n                    Book 02 - Agents of Light and Darkness\n\n                    Book 03 - Nightingale's Lament\n\n                    Book 04 - Hex and the City\n\n                    Book 05 - Paths Not Taken\n\n                    Book 06 - Sharper Than a Serpent's Tooth\n\n                    Book 07 - Hell to Pay\n\n                    Book 08 - The Unnatural Inquirer\n\n                    Book 09 - Just Another Judgement Day\n\n                    Book 10 - The Good, The Bad, and The Uncanny\n\n                    Book 11 - A Hard Day's Knight\n\n                    Book 12 - The Bride Wore Black Leather\n\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d56bf8f94865c6a592c1ffeb9aa6a5b88672f98","amp;dn":"Nightside+Series+by+Simon+R.+Green+%28Books+1+to+12%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d56bf8f94865c6a592c1ffeb9aa6a5b88672f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,86,191,143,148,134,92,106,89,44,31,254,185,170,106,91,136,103,47,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
