Traveling across the Gulf to make sense of an ever-changing story and its often-nonsensical twists, Safina expertly deconstructs the series of calamitous misjudgments that caused the Deepwater Horizon blowout, zeroes in on BPâ€™s misstatements, evasions, and denials, reassesses his own reaction to the governmentâ€™s crisis handling, and reviews the consequences of the leakâ€”and what he considers the real problems, which the press largely overlooked. \r\n\r\nSafina takes us deep inside the faulty thinking that caused the lethal explosion. We join him on aerial surveys across an oil-coated sea. We confront pelicans and other wildlife whose blue universe fades to black. Safina skewers the excuses and the silly jargonâ€”like â€œjunk shotâ€ and â€œtop killâ€â€”that made the tragedy feel like a comedy of horrorsâ€”and highlighted Big Oilâ€™s appalling lack of preparedness for an event that was inevitable. \r\n\r\nBased on extensive research and interviews with fishermen, coastal residents, biologists, and government officials, A Sea In Flames has some surprising answers on whether it was â€œObamaâ€™s Katrina,â€ whether the Coast Guard was as inept in its response as BP was misleading, and whether this worst unintended release of oil in history was really Americaâ€™s worst ecological disaster. \r\n\r\nImpassioned, moving, and even sharply funny, A Sea in Flames is ultimately an indictment of Americaâ€™s main addiction. Safina writes: â€œIn the end, this is a chronicle of a summer of painâ€”and hope. Hope that the full potential of this catastrophe would not materialize, hope that the harm done would heal faster than feared, and hope that even if we didnâ€™t suffer the absolutely worstâ€”weâ€™d still learn the big lesson here. We may have gotten two out of three. Thatâ€™s not good enough. Because: thereâ€™ll be a next time.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc5746a064b581e19f94a103a10baf5d0d27027","amp;dn":"A+Sea+in+Flames+-+The+Deepwater+Horizon+Oil+Blowout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc5746a064b581e19f94a103a10baf5d0d27027","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,197,116,106,6,75,88,30,25,249,74,16,58,16,186,245,208,210,112,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
