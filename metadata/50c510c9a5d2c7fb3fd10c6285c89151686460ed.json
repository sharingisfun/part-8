Warcraft has not only become a classic, winning many awards, but it has set new standards for multiplayer games.

From swords to sorcery, all the elements of classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and the Dead.\n\n1.Extract anywhere.\n2.Press &quot;START THE GAME&quot; batch file.\n3.Play.\n\nCompatible with WIN-ALL\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50c510c9a5d2c7fb3fd10c6285c89151686460ed","amp;dn":"Warcraft%3A+Orcs+%26amp%3B+Humans+%281994%29+-+WIN-ALL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50c510c9a5d2c7fb3fd10c6285c89151686460ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,197,16,201,165,210,199,251,63,209,12,98,133,200,145,81,104,100,96,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
