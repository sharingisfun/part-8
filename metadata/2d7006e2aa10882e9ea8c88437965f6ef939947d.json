This Sample Pack is split into 40 construction kits. Drum tracks are totally separated into single tracks (Kick, Hihats, Percussions, etc...) and all Synth elements are supplied as individual melody loops. Every high-quality feature you expect from Vengeance is here: sidechain and no-sidechain versions, BPM and pitch information, clear folder structure and sample accurate cut loops. Characteristic for &quot;Dirty Electro&quot; are the many different hard bassline fragments, played consecutively in complex groove patterns. This style is rocking the clubs worldwide! The genre specialists Andreas Hinz (Nexus Future Arps Expansions) and Oliver Rockstedt have opened up their sound archives and demonstrate whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on down on the dance floor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7006e2aa10882e9ea8c88437965f6ef939947d","amp;dn":"Vengeance+Dirty+Electro+Vol.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7006e2aa10882e9ea8c88437965f6ef939947d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,112,6,226,170,16,136,46,158,168,200,132,55,150,95,110,249,57,148,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
