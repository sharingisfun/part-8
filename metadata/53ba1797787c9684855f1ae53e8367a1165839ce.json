Basically the creator took the original Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones, and re-edited the whole thing making it much more like the older Star Wars movies and attempted to make a much better movie by re-editing the whole thing.\n\nRead more about the Phantom Edit at Wikipedia:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nI only saw a huge 4+GB files for each of the movies here, so I went and grabbed the TS source files, and removed the Title Screen and Extras.\nI compressed the files using DVD Shrink, at 42% quality of the original. However, 42% sounds like a lot but is practically unnoticeable. Really all it does it make the file faster to download and frees up your hard drive for other movies! =)\nLastly I turned the TS into a playable and burnable .ISO file.\n\nPlay with VLC Media Player (FREE) by opening VLC and dragging the ISO file straight into VLC and it will play the movie.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nAlternatively, you can burn it to a DVD using ImgBurn (FREE).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=====================================================================\n\nPlease remember to seed and say thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53ba1797787c9684855f1ae53e8367a1165839ce","amp;dn":"-XBT-+Star+Wars+Episode+2+-+Attack+of+the+Phantom+Edit+-+Compres","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53ba1797787c9684855f1ae53e8367a1165839ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,186,23,151,120,124,150,132,133,95,26,229,62,131,103,161,22,88,57,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
