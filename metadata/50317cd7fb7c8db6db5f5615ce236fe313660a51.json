NTSC (America) format. This file is not compressed. If you would like to compress it, look up PSP Compressor on CNET (download.com) and you will find a free program that compresses it into a .CSO format. \n\nTo play this, you need a modded PSP. If you don't have mod, this will NOT work.\n\nTo install onto Memory Stick, connect your PSP to your PC, enable USB mode, and copy this file into a folder called &quot;ISO&quot; (no quotation marks) in the root of your card. If it doesn't work correctly, let me know in a comment and I'll try to re-up it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50317cd7fb7c8db6db5f5615ce236fe313660a51","amp;dn":"PSP+-+Gran+Turismo+-+UMDRip+%28NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50317cd7fb7c8db6db5f5615ce236fe313660a51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,49,124,215,251,124,141,182,219,95,86,21,206,35,111,227,19,102,10,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
