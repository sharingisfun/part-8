Aside from DeathstrokeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gameplay, the trailer shows off the Challenge Maps and Skins included in the DLC Pack. Some of DeathstrokeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique gameplay features are also finally seen for the first time.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Deathstroke will be able to use his guns as seen with his Ã¢â‚¬Å“rifle-staffÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Along with other gadgets and Special Combo moves. Also unlike RobinÃ¢â‚¬â€œbut like BatmanÃ¢â‚¬â€œis the Special Combo Disarm &amp; Destroy (at 00:23). I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an appropriate Special Combo move for Deathstroke given his skill level and strength. Deathstroke also has his version of the Special Combo Multi Ground Takedown (at 00:43) in which he leaps to the air and uses his Ã¢â‚¬Å“rifle-staffÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to fire at his enemies. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbe879667acba6bab6b43650adb2c4ae30f7c3c","amp;dn":"Batman.Arkham.Origins.Deathstroke.Challenge.Pack.DLC-XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbe879667acba6bab6b43650adb2c4ae30f7c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,190,135,150,103,172,186,107,171,107,67,101,10,219,44,74,227,15,124,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
