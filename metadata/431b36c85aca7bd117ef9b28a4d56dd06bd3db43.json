Abdul Kalam became President of India in 2002. Questions were raised as to how someone who was a scientist and not a politician, who sported an unusual hairstyle, and had an unassuming way of doing things, would fit into the regal splendour of Rashtrapati Bhavan. In The Kalam Effect, P.M. Nair, who was secretary to the president during the eventful five years till 2007, shows the remarkable nature of Kalams presidency which transformed the way people looked at the office, making Kalam popular in a way few politicians have been. This is an affectionate and intimate portrait of a special human being who changed peoples perception of the highest office of the nation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:431b36c85aca7bd117ef9b28a4d56dd06bd3db43","amp;dn":"Dr.+A.P.J.+Abdul+Kalam+Books++%28RIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"431b36c85aca7bd117ef9b28a4d56dd06bd3db43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,27,54,200,90,202,123,209,23,239,155,40,164,213,109,208,107,211,219,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
