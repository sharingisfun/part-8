This fourth edition has changed fundamentally in presentation and content to provide the clinician with the evidence and clinical tools for effective practice.\n\nThe new model presented in this edition - The Integrated Systems Model and the Clinical Puzzle - co-developed by Diane Lee &amp; Linda-Joy Lee, facilitates effective clinical reasoning, hypothesis development and prescriptive treatment.

Clinical expertise (knowing how to do the right thing at the right time) comes from disciplined, reflective practice and it is hoped that this text will help more clinicians become expert in this field.\n\nPresents an evidence-based approach to the examination, diagnosis and treatment of the lumbopelvic region\nEasy to read and clinican friendly\nDemonstrates how clinicians can translate knowledge derived from scientific research into clinical practice and also use knowledge gained from clinical practice to evaluate the relevance of the scientific research\nHighly illustrated descriptions of tests and techniques for practice\nThe author team - Diane Lee, Linda-Joy Lee and Andry Vleeming - all have international reputations as clinicians and researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c879f38469d0599a8c2a928881469b60587c43ed","amp;dn":"The+Pelvic+Girdle%2C+4E+Lee+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c879f38469d0599a8c2a928881469b60587c43ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,121,243,132,105,208,89,154,140,42,146,136,129,70,155,96,88,124,67,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
