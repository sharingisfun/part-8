Even without a recording contract, Nugent toured constantly, built up a fervent following, and created a smoking hard rock quartet with the help of singer/guitarist Derek St. Holmes, bassist Rob Grange, and drummer Cliff Davies. The band's first release, 1975's Ted Nugent, is a prime slice of testosterone-heavy, raging, unapologetic rock &amp; roll, and along with the band's 1977 release Cat Scratch Fever, it is Nugent's best solo studio album. While the grinding opening track, &quot;Stranglehold,&quot; stretches beyond eight minutes and contains several extended, fiery-hot guitar leads, it does not come off as your typical '70s overindulgent fare -- every single note counts, as Nugent wails away as if his life depended on it. Other Nuge classics include &quot;Motor City Madhouse,&quot; plus the St. Holmes-sung &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Just What the Doctor Ordered,&quot; all eventually becoming arena staples and making the band one of the late-'70s top concert draws. Additional highlights are the unexpected breezy jazz ballad &quot;You Make Me Feel Right at Home,&quot; plus the untamed rockers &quot;Stormtroopin'&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Forest.&quot; Nugent himself hails Ted Nugent as his best work, and with good reason. It's an essential hard rock classic.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Stranglehold\n 02. Stormtroopin'\n 03. Hey Baby\n 04. Just What the Doctor Ordered\n 05. Snakeskin Cowboys\n 06.
