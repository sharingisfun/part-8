The group's emergence was perfectly timed; Radiohead had just released the overly cerebral Kid A, while Oasis had ditched two founding members and embraced psychedelic experimentation on Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. U.K. audiences were hungry for a fresh-faced rock band with big aspirations and an even bigger sound, and Coldplay were more than happy to take the reins. Parachutes went multi-platinum in several countries and earned the band its first Grammy, but Coldplay continued to grow into the 2000s, topping their debut album's success with higher record sales and an increased public profile. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Viva La Vida\n02.Life In Technicolor II\n03.Speed Of Sound\n04.In My Place\n05.Trouble\n06.Talk\n07.Lovers In Japan\n08.Shiver\n09.Yellow\n10.Lost!\n11.Fix You\n12.The Scientist\n13.Don't Panic\n14.Sparks\n15.Spies\n16.High Speed\n17.Brothers And Sisters\n18.Only Superstition\n19.Prosekt's March/Poppyfields\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Violet Hill\n02.Glass Of Water\n03.God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\n04.Square One\n05.Clocks\n06.Cemeteries Of London\n07.X&amp;Y\n08.Politik\n09.The Hardest Part\n10.Strawberry Swing\n11.White Shadows\n12.Things I Don't Understand\n13.Crests Of Waves\n14.No More Keeping My Feet On The Ground\n15.A Message\n16.We Never Change\n17.Bigger Stronger\n18.See You Soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
