Influenced by many filipino fighting techniques taught and handed down from Dan Inosanto and Edgar Sulite.\n\nVolume 2:  \nThis volume contains the Lameco system, eight strips (disarms) from the knife being held in the fencing grip and reverse grip disarms from both the Lameco system and the Inosanto/Lacosta systems.\n\nShow someone you love them, hit'em with a stick! \n\nMy DVD had some scratches so there are some points where the frame is static for a second or two and some digital glitches.  I cleaned it up the best I could.\n\nKeywords: silat, escrima, kali, knife fighting, self defense, martial art, stick fighting\n\nFor others:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/norrish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/norrish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f047c8a3e8aaf8affcc2fd369da20a9c52128976","amp;dn":"Kali+Knife+Fighting+2+of+3+-+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f047c8a3e8aaf8affcc2fd369da20a9c52128976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,71,200,163,232,170,248,175,252,194,253,54,157,162,10,156,82,18,137,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
