The world is at war.Charlotte Gray, a young Scottish woman, is parachuted behing enemy lins in southen france. Only she knows she has a dual mission. Officallly she has been recrutied by the British Gorvenment on a special operation to liaise with the local Resistance group, who are using guerrilla tacktics against the occupying German Army. UnOffically, she is searching for her lover, Peter, an English armyman missing in action after his plane is shot down.\nAs Charlotte becomes more deeply involved with the Resistance fighters she realises that her love of France and its people will change her forever.\n\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nIf nothing else, the superb cinematography makes Charlotte Grey a winner. The picture is filmed through a creative and sensitive eye with wonderful angles, evocative moods and sensitive textures and shades. The rain and snow outside the train window in the opening scenes is somehow just so right. But photography aside, this is a gripping and well acted work that will satisfy fans of both war movies and love stories\n. Michael Gambon gives an Oscar worthy performance. It's also so nice to see a film that does not have one of those dreadful syrupy and impractical happy endings. Not that it's a totally sad ending. Call it a bitter sweet ending. In any case this film is an absolute delight from the titles to the closing scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f4ecfbc542e15a561ca5a3bedd40ab47c5f01a","amp;dn":"Charlotte+Gray+-+%28Cate+Blanchett+-+Billy+Crudup%29%282001%29%5BDvdRip-Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f4ecfbc542e15a561ca5a3bedd40ab47c5f01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,244,236,251,197,66,225,90,86,28,165,163,190,221,64,171,71,197,240,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
