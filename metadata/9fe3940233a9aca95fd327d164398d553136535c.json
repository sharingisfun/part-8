When King Records owner Syd Nathan refused to fund the recording, thinking it commercial folly, Brown single-mindedly proceeded anyway, paying for it out of his own pocket. He had been out on the road night after night for a while, and he knew that the magic that was part and parcel of a James Brown show was something no record had ever caught. Hit follows hit without a pause -- &quot;I'll Go Crazy,&quot; &quot;Try Me,&quot; &quot;Think,&quot; &quot;Please Please Please,&quot; &quot;I Don't Mind,&quot; &quot;Night Train,&quot; and more. The affirmative screams and cries of the audience are something you've never experienced unless you've seen the Brown Revue in a Black theater. If you have, I need not say more; if you haven't, suffice to say that this should be one of the very first records you ever own. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img241.imageshack.us/img241/49/jbapollofrontde1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img241.imageshack.us/img241/49/jbapollofrontde1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n01.
