The episode looks at the evolution of arms in the Civil War, beginning with the model 1855, a smaller caliber but more accurate &quot;tape primer&quot; firearm invented by a dentist named Edward Maynard that ultimately proved unreliable in practice. The model 1861 was developed in response, a classic percussion fired weapon that added in a rear sight and that would become the most widely used arm in the war. Episode three also examines the Confederate raid on the Harper's Ferry armory and the Confederacy's dire need for arms and their purchase and trading of cotton for arms with Europe, notably acquiring the British Enfield and Austrian Lorenz.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4396/gunstheevolutionoffireaa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/1998/gunstheevolutionoffirea.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n2)  SD Version \n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1452 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 404\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 23\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 40.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: average 414 MB\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Source: BluRay DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Guns-The-Evolution-of-Firearms-Blu-ray/59215/#Review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8b03a70540e4d956ff3c7ac02d4836fbde37394","amp;dn":"Guns+The+Evolution+of+Firearms+3of7+The+Weapons+of+the+Civil+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8b03a70540e4d956ff3c7ac02d4836fbde37394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,176,58,112,84,14,77,149,111,243,199,172,2,212,131,111,189,227,115,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
