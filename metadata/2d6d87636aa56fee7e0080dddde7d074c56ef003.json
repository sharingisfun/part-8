His hellfire brand of comedy has rained verbal lightning bolts around American audiences and politicians for decades, yet you've probably never heard of him. But gone you've experienced Bobcat Goldthwait's bland ache atmosphere portrait of him and heard Crimmins's unspecified, you will never forget him. From his unmistakable bullish frame came a scathingly ribald stand-occurring style that took to the lead audiences by force. Through stark, tame hurting observation and judo-linked to turns of phrase, Crimmins's choking-fire comedy was a act concerning ignorance and complacency in '80s America at the peak of an sick-considered foreign policy. Crimmins discusses substitute side of his environment, revealing in detail a dark and tortured feeling p.s. that inspired his cartoon-varying whisk of activism in the dream of saving others from a same experience.
