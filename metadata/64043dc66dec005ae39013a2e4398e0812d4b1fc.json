Only one thing is for certain: She has been wrongfully imprisoned and will have to escape! After all, she feels entirely sane   and her speaking stuffed toy bunny Harvey wholeheartedly agrees. Together they undertake a daring breakout attempt, meeting up with numerous oddball inmates, like the Man in the Bee s Costume or Siamese twins Hoti and Moti. But Dr. Marcel, the sinister head of the institute, will do everything in his power to stop Edna. What evil scheme is afoot? Slowly, Edna begins to regain her memories of the past.\n\nEdna and Harvey: Harvey s New Eyes\nLilli is the best-behaved little girl in the world. She executes all her chores in a diligent manner, no matter how unfair they may be. Her innocent, imperturbable way of carrying out the orders of others has something both tragic and eerie about it. Any angry thoughts, any childlike disobedience is buried deep beneath a seemingly impenetrable surface of sweetness. But how long will these feelings stay hidden? And where do the friendly little gnomes come from that paint over everything unpleasant in Lilli s vicinity with a pleasant pink color? Are they real or just a product of her subconscious? Find out in Edna &amp; Harvey: Harvey s New Eyes!\n\nEdna and Harvey: The Breakout and Harvey s New Eyes are point-and-click adventures that hark back to the good old days. Backgrounds and characters are completely 2D and drawn by hand. The cast of characters ranges from mildly deranged to the certifiably insane--twisted humor guaranteed!
