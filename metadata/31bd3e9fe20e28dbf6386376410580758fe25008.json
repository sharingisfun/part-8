This black militia group, \nwhich has been forgotten by many, became a focal point in the civil rights \nmovement at the time.\n\nMarcus (Whitaker) is a thoughtful family man and a war veteran who works in \nthe local paper mill. He has lived his life in quiet acquiescence to the \nwhite community, because he feels it is best for his family. When two white \ncivil rights activists from the North, Deane (Silverman) and Hillibrand \n(Adam Weiner), arrive in Bogalusa, Marcus vehemently opposes his family's \ninvolvement in any of the civil rights meetings and protests organized by \nDeane and Hillibrand. Marcus finally changes his passive stance when he is \narrested and beaten by the local cops for trying to defend his daughter \nduring a peaceful protest rally that turns violent. When he doesn't come \nhome from the police station, his wife Velma (Melanie Nicholls-King) goes \nto Reverend Gregory (Davis) and asks for his help. Marcus has to face the \nfact that his life has changed and he must now take a stand. His stand \nresults in the creation of &quot;The Deacons for Defense.&quot; With the help of the \nDeacons, Marcus sets up neighborhood patrols, helps protect protestors and \nthe civil rights workers, and strikes fear in the members of the Klan.\n\nCAST\nForest Whitaker as Marcus Clay\nOssie Davis as Rev.
