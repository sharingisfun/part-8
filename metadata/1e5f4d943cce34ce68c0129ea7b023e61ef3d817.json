Schulz was born in Drohobych, in the Austrian sector of the Partitioned Poland, and spent most of his life there. He was killed by a German Nazi officer.\n\nSchulz developed his extraordinary imagination in a swarm of identities and nationalities: he was a Jew who thought and wrote in Polish, was fluent in German, immersed in Jewish culture, yet unfamiliar with the Yiddish language. He drew inspiration from specific local and ethnic sources, looking inward and close to home rather than to the world at large. Avoiding travel, he preferred to remain in his provincial hometown, which over the course of his life belonged to or was fought over by successive states: the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1792Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1919); the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic (1919); the Second Polish Republic (1919Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1939); and, during World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. (It is now part of the Ukraine). Because his writings avoid explicit mention of world events, a hasty reader might imagine his life to have been hermit like Ã¢â‚¬â€œ uneventful and enclosed.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books in both Mobi and ePUB format:\n\n* Complete Fictions\n\n* Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass\n\n* The Street of Crocodiles\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/03/brief-survey-short-story-bruno-schulz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/03/brief-survey-short-story-bruno-schulz&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Schulz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Schulz&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/the-age-of-genius&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/08/the-age-of-genius&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5f4d943cce34ce68c0129ea7b023e61ef3d817","amp;dn":"Bruno+Schulz+-+Polish+Author+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5f4d943cce34ce68c0129ea7b023e61ef3d817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,95,77,148,60,206,52,206,104,192,18,158,167,176,35,230,30,243,216,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
