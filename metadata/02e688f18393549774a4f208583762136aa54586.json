Wounded in combat and honorably discharged nine years ago, Jack Daley still suffers nightmares from when he served his country as a sniper, racking up sixteen confirmed kills. Now a struggling author, Jack accepts an offer to write a near-future novel about a serial killer, based on a Hollywood script outline. It' s an opportunity to build his writing career, and a future with his girlfriend, Kit Majors. But Jack' s other talent is also in demand. A package arrives on his doorstep containing a sniper rifle, complete with silencer and ammunition-- and the first installment of a $100,000 payment to kill a &quot; bad man.&quot; The twisted offer is genuine. The people behind it are dangerous. They prove that they have Jack under surveillance.
