And it&amp;#039;s all done with the subtle, controlled emoting of the actors, guided by a director with a keen eye for detail, who knows exactly what he wants, how to get it and how to present it.\n\nThis emotionally involving film stars Thandie Newton as Shandurai, a young woman forced to leave South Africa for Rome after her husband, a school teacher, is arrested by the Military Police, then summarily held in prison-- and without a trial-- indefinitely (His crime is never precisely indicated, though it is implied during a classroom scene at the very beginning of the film). In Rome, Shandurai attends medical school, while supporting herself by working as a housekeeper for a man named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), a reclusive pianist, apparently fairly well-to-do, who gives piano lessons to children in his home.\n\nEarly on in the film it is evident that Mr. Kinsky looks upon Shandurai as something more than merely a housekeeper; he is obviously quite taken with her. The moral implications of the situation are readily apparent, of course, as is the position in which it will predictably place Shandurai at some point in the near future. There is little doubt as to the direction the story is taking; the question that remains, however, is how Shandurai will deal with her impending dilemma.\n\nQualidade de VÃƒÂ­deo: DVD Rip\nVÃƒÂ­deo Codec: XViD\nVÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: 127 Kbps\nÃƒï¿½udio Codec: MP3\nÃƒï¿½udio Bitrate: 238\nResoluÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o: 512 x 288\nFormato de Tela: Tela Cheia (4x3)\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nTamanho: 717 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c9b8ddde5d5ef67beef0d592d4954853cd56ba7","amp;dn":"Besieged+%2F+L%5C%27Assedio+-+Bertolucci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c9b8ddde5d5ef67beef0d592d4954853cd56ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,155,141,221,229,213,239,103,190,239,13,89,45,73,84,133,60,213,107,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
