Savings and loan scandals. Enron.\n Corporate crimes were once thought of as victimless offenses, but nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with billions of dollars and an increasingly global economy at stakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this is understood to be far from the truth.\n The International Handbook of White-Collar and Corporate Crime explores the complex interplay of factors involved when corporate cultures normalize lawbreaking, and when organizational behavior is pushed to unethical (and sometimes inhumane) limits. Featuring original contributions from a panel of experts representing North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, this timely volume presents multidisciplinary views on recent corporate wrongdoing affecting economic and social conditions worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6dea5dcec6c45ed262ecaf4e6d2b9ae4f0c7ac","amp;dn":"International+Handbook+of+White-Collar+and+Corporate+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6dea5dcec6c45ed262ecaf4e6d2b9ae4f0c7ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,109,234,93,206,198,196,94,210,98,236,175,78,109,43,154,228,240,199,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
