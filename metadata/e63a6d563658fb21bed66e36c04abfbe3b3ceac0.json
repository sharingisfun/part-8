It is free software and therefore free to download, use and distribute. The goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements. LibreOffice is capable of performing the same tasks as every other office suite, from making calculations to drawing. \r\n\r\nRelease Notes: \r\n\r\nLibreOffice 5.2.2 (2016-09-29) \r\n\r\nThis is the second bugfix release of the 5.2.x branch of LibreOffice which contains new features and program enhancements. As such, the version is stable and is suitable for all users. This version may contain a few annoying bugs which will be fixed in the next bugfix versions to come. Detailed release notes can be accessed from the list below.\r\n\r\nIn case of problems on Windows related to OpenGL rendering, you can disable it completely by applying a registry setting (only needed if LibreOffice crashes on startup, otherwise you can disable it in Tools|Options â†’ LibreOffice â†’ View). You can find the necessary fragment in bugzilla (save with a .reg file extension, then you can double-click on the file to apply the change) \r\n\r\nHomepage : \r\n \nhttp://www.documentfoundation.org/ \r\n\r\nInstall Notes: \r\n\r\n1] Install The App \r\n2] Enjoy This Release!! \r\n\r\nBy: \r\n\r\nSceneDL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e63a6d563658fb21bed66e36c04abfbe3b3ceac0","amp;dn":"LibreOffice+5.2.2+Final+%2832+bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e63a6d563658fb21bed66e36c04abfbe3b3ceac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,58,109,86,54,88,251,33,190,214,110,54,192,74,191,190,59,60,234,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
