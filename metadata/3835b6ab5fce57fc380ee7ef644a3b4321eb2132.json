You can even make functional robots without getting into Mindstorms and programming. In Practical LEGO Technics, Mark Rollins shows you how to use LEGO and Power Functions components like motors and remote controls to create motorized cars, all terrain vehicles, vehicle steering, construction equipment such as cranes and forklifts, airplanes. All-in-all, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn to create a wide variety of fun, unique LEGO creations.\n\nLEGO Technic is similar to Mindstorms in that you can create all sorts of cool vehicles and gadgets. But unlike Mindstorms, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to learn programming. Power Functions allows you to add motors, remote control, and battery boxes to your LEGO projects, no programming required.
