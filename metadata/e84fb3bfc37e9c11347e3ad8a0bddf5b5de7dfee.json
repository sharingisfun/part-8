Yet at the same time, by every measure of human well-being, from life expectancy to clean water to climate safety, life has been getting better and better.\n\nHow can this be?\n\nThe explanation, energy expert Alex Epstein argues in The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, is that we usually hear only one side of the story. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re taught to think only of the negatives of fossil fuels, their risks and side effects, but not their positivesÃ¢â‚¬â€their unique ability to provide cheap, reliable energy for a world of seven billion people. And the moral significance of cheap, reliable energy, Epstein argues, is woefully underrated. Energy is our ability to improve every single aspect of life, whether economic or environmental.\n\nIf we look at the big picture of fossil fuels compared with the alternatives, the overall impact of using fossil fuels is to make the world a far better place. We are morally obligated to use more fossil fuels for the sake of our economy and our environment.\n\nDrawing on original insights and cutting-edge research, Epstein argues that most of what we hear about fossil fuels is a myth.\n\nTaking everything into account, including the facts about climate change, Epstein argues that Ã¢â‚¬Å“fossil fuels are easy to misunderstand and demonize, but they are absolutely good to use. And they absolutely need to be championed. . . . MankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s use of fossil fuels is supremely virtuousÃ¢â‚¬â€because human life is the standard of value and because using fossil fuels transforms our environment to make it wonderful for human life.\n\n\nAbout the author:\n Alex Epstein started the Center for Industrial Progress to offer an alternative environmental philosophy to America, one that is antipollution but prodevelopment. A popular speaker on college campuses, he has publicly debated leading environmentalists. He lives in Orange County, California","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e84fb3bfc37e9c11347e3ad8a0bddf5b5de7dfee","amp;dn":"The+Moral+Case+for+Fossil+Fuels+-+Alex+Epstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e84fb3bfc37e9c11347e3ad8a0bddf5b5de7dfee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,79,179,191,195,126,156,17,52,126,58,216,160,189,223,91,93,231,223,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
