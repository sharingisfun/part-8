Death. War. Pestilence. These are the harbingers of the biblical apocalypse, of the End of the World. In science fiction, the end is triggered by less figurative means: nuclear holocaust, biological warfare/pandemic, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm.\n\nBut before any catastrophe, there are people who see it coming. During, there are heroes who fight against it. And after, there are the survivors who persevere and try to rebuild.\n\nTHE APOCALYPSE TRIPTYCH will tell their stories.\n\nEdited by acclaimed anthologist John Joseph Adams and bestselling author Hugh Howey, The Apocalypse Triptych is a series of three anthologies of apocalyptic fiction. THE END IS NIGH focuses on life before the apocalypse. THE END IS NOW turns its attention to life during the apocalypse. And THE END HAS COME explores life after the apocalypse.\n\nTHE END IS NIGH is about the match.\n\nTHE END HAS COME is about what will rise from the ashes.\n\nTHE END IS NOW is about the conflagration.\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a816fd94c9aec6106aeaaa7a6c134c017fe4737","amp;dn":"The+End+is+Now+%28The+Apocalypse+Triptych+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a816fd94c9aec6106aeaaa7a6c134c017fe4737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,129,111,217,76,154,236,97,6,174,170,167,166,193,52,192,23,254,71,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
