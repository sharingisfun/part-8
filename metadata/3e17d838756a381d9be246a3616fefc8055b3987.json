Now he'll face a far more complicated enemy: his own body.\r\n\r\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. discovers that Cap is harboring an extinction-level pathogen hidden in his cells for decades, Cap's greatest fear is realized: Until the virus can be cured, he'll have to go into deep freeze. But he won't be alone.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Cap's greatest enemy managed the biggest coup of his career when he implanted his mind into a clone of Steve Rogers' body - virus and all. And Red Skull isn't the sacrificial type.\r\n\r\nCap will have to put his archnemesis on ice - without exposing the virus. Can Cap stay alive along enough to capture Red Skull and return to his deepest nightmare? \r\n\r\nRead by Richard Rohan as Narrator, James Keegan as Captain America, Andy Brownstein as The Red Skull, James Konicek as Nick Fury, Lawrence Redmond as Dr. Kade, Erika Rose as Dr. Nia Nâ€™Tomo, plus more\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e17d838756a381d9be246a3616fefc8055b3987","amp;dn":"Stefan+Petrucha+-+Captain+America+-+Dark+Designs+%5BGraphicAudio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e17d838756a381d9be246a3616fefc8055b3987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,23,216,56,117,106,56,29,155,226,70,163,97,111,239,200,5,91,57,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
