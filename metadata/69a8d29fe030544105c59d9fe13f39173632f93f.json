In fact, the branches of elementary mathematics were created primarily to serve extra-mathematical needs and interests. In the very act of meeting such needs each of these creations has proved to have inestimable importance for man's understanding of the nature of his world and himself.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Why Mathematics?\n2 A Historical Orientation\n3 Logic and Mathematics\n4 Number: the Fundamental Concept\n5 Algebra, the Higher Arithmetic\n6 The Nature and Uses of Euclidean Geometry\n7 Charting the Earth and the Heavens\n8 The Mathematical Order of Nature\n9 The Awakening of Europe\n10 Mathematics and Painting in the Renaissance\n11 Projective Geometry\n12 Coordinate Geometry\n13 The Simplest Formulas in Action\n14 Parametric Equations and Curvilinear Motion\n15 The Application of Formulas to Gravitation\n16 The Differential Calculus\n17 The Integral Calculus\n18 Trigonometric Functions and Oscillatory Motion\n19 The Trigonometric Analysis of Musical Sounds\n20 NonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Euclidean Geometries and Their Significance\n21 Arithmetlcs and Their Algebras\n22 The Statistical Approach to the Social and Biological Sciences\n23 The Theory of Probability\n24 The Nature and Value. of Mathematics\nTable Trigonometric Ratios\nAnswers to Selected and Review Exercises\nAdditional Answers and Solutions\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a8d29fe030544105c59d9fe13f39173632f93f","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+the+Nonmathematician+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a8d29fe030544105c59d9fe13f39173632f93f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,168,210,159,224,48,84,65,5,197,157,159,225,63,57,23,54,50,249,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
