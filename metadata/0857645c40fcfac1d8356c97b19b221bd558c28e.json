It's been estimated that high-frequency tradersÃ¢â‚¬â€one form of computerized tradingÃ¢â‚¬â€accounts for more than half of each day's total equity market trades. In this environment, individual traders need to learn new techniques that can help them navigate modern markets and avoid being whipsawed by larger, institutional players.\n\nTrading the Measured Move offers a blueprint for profiting from the price waves created by computer-driven algorithmic and high-frequency trading strategies. The core of author David Halsey's approach is a novel application of Fibonnaci retracements, which he uses to set price targets and low-risk entry points. When properly applied, it allows traders to gauge market sentiment, recognize institutional participation at specific support and resistance levels, and differentiate between short-term and long-term trades at various price points in the market.\n\nProvides guidance for individual traders who fear they can't compete in today's high-frequency dominated markets\nOutlines specific trade set ups, including opening gap strategies, breakouts and failed breakout strategies, range trading strategies, and pivot trading strategies\nReveals how to escape institutional strategies designed to profit from slower-moving market participants\nEngaging and informative, Trading the Measured Move will provide you with a new perspective, and new strategies, to successfully navigate today's computer driven financial markets\n\nTable of Contents :\n-------------------\n\nPreface xiii\n\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nCHAPTER 1 TodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trading Environment 1\n\nDescent of the Pit and Ascent of the Screen 1\n\nPlayers on the Field 2\n\nThe Algo Brothers 4\n\nWhere Are You?
