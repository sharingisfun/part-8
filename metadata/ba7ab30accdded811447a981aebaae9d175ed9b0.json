In House Rules she examines how being different can have dire consequences. \n\nTeenager Jacob Hunt has AspergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s syndrome. A forensic science wizard, he follows his scanner to show up at crime scenes and give law enforcement officials his advice. But when his tutor is found dead, he becomes a suspect. Suddenly, his AspergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s traitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not looking people in the eye, tics and twitchesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½look more like guilt to the investigators.\nSuddenly Jacob and his moother are caught up in America's maddening legal system, which favors those who communicate a particular way.\n\nAs Picoult vividly depicts, being different can have dire consequences, and justice isn't blind for everyone. The tension mounts through a breathtaking, full-cast performance of this provocative novel.\n\n&quot;Picoult has become a master - almost a clairvoyany - at targeting hot issues and writing highly readable page-turners about them&quot; --Washington Post\n - - -\n\nFrom jodipicoult.com:\n\nHOUSE RULES is about Jacob Hunt, a teenage boy with AspergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Syndrome. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself well to others, and like many kids with AS, Jacob has a special focus on one subject ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in his case, forensic analysis. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to doÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s usually right. But then one day his tutor is found dead, and the police come to question him. All of the hallmark behaviors of AspergerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not looking someone in the eye, stimulatory tics and twitches, inappropriate affect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ can look a heck of a lot like guilt to law enforcement personnel -- and suddenly, Jacob finds himself accused of murder. HOUSE RULES looks at what it means to be different in our society, how autism affects a family, and how our legal system works well for people who communicate a certain way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but lousy for those who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba7ab30accdded811447a981aebaae9d175ed9b0","amp;dn":"HOUSE+RULES+-+Jodi+Picoult+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba7ab30accdded811447a981aebaae9d175ed9b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,122,179,10,204,221,237,129,20,71,169,129,174,186,174,157,23,94,217,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
