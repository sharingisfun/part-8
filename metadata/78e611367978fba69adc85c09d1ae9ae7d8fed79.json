Then we'll dive into the theory of creating physically based materials. Here we'll discuss the the key properties of a material that will determine how your material will look in the engine.\n\nThen we'll dive deeper into these critical properties by discussing the different Blend modes and Lighting Models. Then we'll discuss each Material Input and how they affect the material and their possible uses.\n\nAfter that, we'll learn about material expressions and functions, the building blocks to creating incredible looking materials. Finally, we'll take what we've learned and create a set of materials for a game prop in Unreal Engine 4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78e611367978fba69adc85c09d1ae9ae7d8fed79","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Materials+in+Unreal+Engine+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78e611367978fba69adc85c09d1ae9ae7d8fed79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,230,17,54,121,120,251,166,154,220,133,192,157,26,233,174,125,143,237,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
