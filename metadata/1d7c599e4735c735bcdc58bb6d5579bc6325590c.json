Nawy\nProduct Description\nCompletely revised to reflect the new ACI 318-08 Building Code and International Building Code, IBC 2009, this popular book offers a unique approach to examining the design of prestressed concrete members in a logical, step-by-step trial and adjustment procedure. Integrates handy flow charts to help readers better understand the steps needed for design and analysis. Includes a revised chapter containing the latest ACI and AASHTO Provisions on the design of post-tensioned beam end anchorage blocks using the strut-and-tie approach in conformity with ACI 318-08 Code. Offers a new complete section with two extensive design examples using the strut-and-tie approach for the design of corbels and deep beams. Features an addition to the elastic method of design, with comprehensive design examples on LRFD and Standard AASHTO designs of bridge deck members for flexure, shear and torsion, conforming to the latest AASHTO specifications. Includes a revised chapter on slender columns, including a simplified load-contour biaxial bending method which is easier to apply in desiign, using moments rather than loads in the reciprocal approach. A useful construction reference for engineers.\n\nAbout the Author\nDR. EDWARD G. NAWY is a distinguished profession in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.
