The album went to number one on the Billboard album chart, spending 14 weeks there, the longest run of any album that year.[27]\n\nAll seven songs from the film, the first side of the UK album, were featured along with &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot;, which, although written for the film, was cut at the last minute. The American version also included four easy listening-styled instrumental versions of Lennon and McCartney songs arranged by George Martin conducting an orchestra of studio musicians: &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Ringo's Theme&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;. After EMI acquired United Artists Records, this album was reissued on 17 August 1980 on the Capitol label, catalogue SW-11921.\n\nWhile the stereo version of the album included the instrumental tracks in true stereo, the Beatles' own recordings appeared as electronically rechannelled stereo recordings made from the mono releases. The 1980 Capitol Records release used the same master tape as the original United Artists stereo release, despite the availability of several tracks with official stereo remixes by that time. True stereo versions of most of the songs appeared on the Capitol album Something New, released in July 1964. &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; finally appeared in stereo on the Apple Records compilation Hey Jude in 1970. The song &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; did not appear in stereo in the US until the LP Reel Music in March 1982. In 2014, the American version of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; was released on CD individually and in a boxed set of all the other US Beatles albums to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Beatles first US visit. This CD reissue features all of the songs in both true stereo and mono mixes.\n\nTrack Listing [US - REMASTER] [320k MP3]\n\nMONO &amp; STEREO - REMASTERS\n\n01. \t&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:33\n02. \t&quot;Tell Me Why&quot;   \tLennon with McCartney \t2:10\n03. \t&quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot;   \tLennon \t2:06\n04. \t&quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;   \tinstrumental \t2:10\n05. \t&quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance with You&quot;   \tHarrison \t1:59\n06. \t&quot;And I Love Her&quot;   \tinstrumental \t3:46\n07. \t&quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;   \tLennon \t2:44\n08. \t&quot;If I Fell&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:22\n09. \t&quot;And I Love Her&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:29\n10. \t&quot;Ringo's Theme (This Boy)&quot;   \tinstrumental \t3:10\n11. \t&quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:12\n12. \t&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;   \tinstrumental \t2:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af52b44b1016b2620327ccbc2c2629152b27806d","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+A+Hard+Days+Night+%5BUS+-+REMASTER%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af52b44b1016b2620327ccbc2c2629152b27806d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,82,180,75,16,22,178,98,3,39,204,188,44,38,41,21,43,39,128,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
