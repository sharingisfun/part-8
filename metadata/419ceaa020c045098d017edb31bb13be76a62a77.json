With a seemingly endless run of touring over the last five years, the band has grown into one of the most exciting acts to come out of NashvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent hotbed of indie music.\n\nWhile co-founder Kelsey Kopecky is the namesake of the band, the six members take the family moniker to heart, each playing various instruments to produce a warm homegrown sound wholly their own. In many ways, Kopecky Family Band encapsulates their hometown of Nashville: emergent, vibrant, Southern, and deeply rooted in a musical background that creates a truly distinctive character. Just as their city has come a long way, the LP arrives as a culmination of years of hard work for Kopecky Family Band. From the sound of it, Kids Raising Kids may be the first big step towards an ever-rising future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:419ceaa020c045098d017edb31bb13be76a62a77","amp;dn":"Kopecky+Family+Band+-+Kids+Raising+Kids+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"419ceaa020c045098d017edb31bb13be76a62a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,156,234,160,32,192,69,9,141,1,126,219,49,187,19,190,118,166,42,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
