Topics in reliability include reliability models, life data analysis and modeling, design for reliability as well as accelerated life testing and reliability growth analysis, while topics in quality include design for quality, acceptance sampling and supplier selection, statistical process control, production tests such as environmental stress screening and burn-in, warranty and maintenance. The book provides comprehensive insights into two closely related subjects, and includes a wealth of examples and problems to enhance readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comprehension and link theory and practice. All numerical examples can be easily solved using Microsoft Excel. The book is intended for senior undergraduate and postgraduate students in related engineering and management programs such as mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, industrial engineering and engineering management programs, as well as for researchers and engineers in the quality and reliability fields","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51f9aaeea1f43c5af0be16a558e8b4ca6483f0eb","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Quality+and+Reliability+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51f9aaeea1f43c5af0be16a558e8b4ca6483f0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,249,170,238,161,244,60,90,240,190,22,165,88,232,180,202,100,131,240,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
