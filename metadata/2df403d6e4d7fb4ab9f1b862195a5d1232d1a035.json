His views on Narendra Modi, Arvind Kejriwal and the NehruÃ¢â‚¬â€œGandhi dynasty, and his decoding of coalition politics and the significant changes ushered in by the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, are expressed with his characteristic sharp insights, wit and wisdom. So too are his analyses of the sweeping changes taking place in the print and TV media, and his pen portraits of personalities such as Ratan Tata, Niira Radia, Khushwant Singh, Sachin Tendulkar and Arundhati Roy. Other chapters examine the lack of humour in our political life, the changing aspirations of the Indian middle class, and the mistakes and regrets of his life. Peppered with anecdotes and gossip, every page of this honest, lively and irreverent book is both illuminating and entertaining","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df403d6e4d7fb4ab9f1b862195a5d1232d1a035","amp;dn":"Editor+Unplugged+-+Vinod+Mehta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df403d6e4d7fb4ab9f1b862195a5d1232d1a035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,244,3,214,228,215,251,74,185,241,184,98,25,90,93,18,50,209,160,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
