Several choice selections from their time on the Beeb in the years 1996-2001 have been collected on The BBC Sessions, due from Matador November 18. Though not comprehensive Sessions covers a wide swath of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formative period, from recordings laid down shortly after the release of their brilliant debut Tigermilk to the year after the release of their fourth LP Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant.\nThe disc is comprised of a complete Mark Radcliffe session from July 1996, an abbreviated take of the version of TigermilkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s I Could Be Dreaming performed at a December 96 Radcliffe session, and five tunes from a July 97 Steve Lamacq Evening Session show. Of particular note, though, are the last four tracks, all from a 2001 John Peel session: the tunes are beloved by many Belle and Sebastian geeks not only for their quality and rarity, but also their historical importanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ those sessions were the final recordings the band made with founding member Campbell.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c266f375e306dbe6a7e459072c89cdb27185ab3c","amp;dn":"Belle+and+Sebastian+-+The+BBC+Sessions+%5Bmp3-160-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c266f375e306dbe6a7e459072c89cdb27185ab3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,102,243,117,227,6,219,230,167,228,89,7,44,137,205,178,113,133,171,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
