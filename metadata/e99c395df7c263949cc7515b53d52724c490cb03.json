He broke off work on it in 1942 to compose patriotic pieces and eventually \nWar and Peace. Cinderella was intended from the beginning to be a full-length classical piece and was finally \npremiered, with Ulanova in the title role, in 1945. It immediately became a staple and quickly traveled to \nother countries. In England, the character additions of Sir Frederick Ashton are legendary and have been adopted \nalmost everywhere.\n\nThe production here was created in 1986 by Rudolf Nureyev. He originally wanted to produce Cinderella in \nclassic 17th century style and rejected the idea of set designer Petrika Ionesco that the work be set \nin Hollywood in the 1930s. However, Nureyev could not get this idea out of his mind and once the \ntwo got started all of NureyevÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of the movies came into play. The Prince becomes a Movie Star, \nthe Fairy Godmother a Hollywood producer and Cinderella eventually wins both the Movie Star and a film contract. \nIn between there are many allusions to 1930s movies and even a couple of scenes shot to appear as if on screen. \nYet the basic story is intact and Nureyev was scrupulous in his use of ProkofievÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music.\n\n....\n\n-- William Kreindler, MusicWeb Internation\n\n\nCinderella Ã¢â‚¬â€œ AgnÃƒÂ¨s Letestu\nThe Movie Star Ã¢â‚¬â€œ JosÃƒÂ© Martinez\nThe Sisters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ LaÃƒÂ«titia Pujol, StÃƒÂ©phanie Romberg\nThe Mother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ StÃƒÂ©phane Phavorin\nThe Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wilfried Romoli\n\nParis National Opera Ballet\nParis National Opera Orchestra\nKoen Kessels, conductor\n\nRudolf Nureyev, choreographer\n\nRecorded live at the Palais Garnier, Paris, on 24, 26,and 28 April 2008.\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.77:1 \nRun Time: 1:25 + 41\nchapters: 38 + 15\nresolution: 640x368\nVideo Codec: AVC/h.264\nAudio Codec: AAC \nEncoder handbrake: 0.9.6\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e99c395df7c263949cc7515b53d52724c490cb03","amp;dn":"Cinderella-Paris+Ballet-2008%5BiPod+H264+DVDrip%5D%28with+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e99c395df7c263949cc7515b53d52724c490cb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,156,57,93,247,194,99,148,156,199,81,91,83,213,39,36,196,144,203,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
