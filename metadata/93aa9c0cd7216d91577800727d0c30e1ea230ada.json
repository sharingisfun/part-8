A collection of stitch combinationsÃ¯Â¿Â½everything from basic knit-and-purl stitches to more complex cables, lace, and colorworkÃ¯Â¿Â½enables knitters to create their own designs or modify existing patterns with ease. The content is timeless (unlike a book that contains patterns for garments), so this hardcover book will have a long shelf life and will have the potential to be a solid backlist performer for years to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93aa9c0cd7216d91577800727d0c30e1ea230ada","amp;dn":"Knitting+Stitches+Visual+Encyclopedia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93aa9c0cd7216d91577800727d0c30e1ea230ada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,170,156,12,215,33,109,145,87,120,0,114,125,12,48,225,234,35,10,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
