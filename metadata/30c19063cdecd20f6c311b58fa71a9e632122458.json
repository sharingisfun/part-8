He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio. Essentially the polar opposite of Avery's other famous MGM character, the loud and wacky Screwy Squirrel, Droopy moves slowly and lethargically, speaks in a jowly monotone voice, andÃ¢â‚¬â€though hardly an imposing characterÃ¢â‚¬â€is shrewd enough to outwit his enemies. When finally roused to anger, often by a bad guy laughing heartily at him, Droopy is capable of beating adversaries twice his size with a comical thrashing (&quot;You know what? That makes me mad!&quot;).\n\nThe character first appeared, nameless, in Avery's 1943 cartoon Dumb-Hounded. Though he would not be called &quot;Droopy&quot; onscreen until his fifth cartoon, SeÃƒÂ±or Droopy (1949), the character was officially first labeled Happy Hound, a name used in the character's appearances in Our Gang Comics. After the demise of the Droopy series in 1958, the character has been revived several times for new productions, often television shows also featuring MGM's other famous cartoon stars, Tom and Jerry.\n\nIn the cartoon Northwest Hounded Police, Droopy's last name was given as &quot;McPoodle&quot;. In The Chump Champ, it was given as &quot;Poodle&quot;. Nevertheless, Droopy is generally understood to be a basset hound.\n\nEpisodes:\n=========\nDumb-Hounded - (1943)\nThe Shooting Of Dan McGoo - (1945)\nWild And Woolfy - (1945)\nNorthwest Hounded Police - (1946)\nSenor Droopy - (1949)\nWags To Riches - (1949)\nOut-Foxed - (1949)\nThe Chump Champ - (1950)\nDaredevil Droopy - (1951)\nDroopy's Good Deed - (1951)\nDroopy's &quot;Double Trouble&quot; - (1951)\nCaballero Droopy - (1952)\nThe Three Little Pups - (1953)\nDrag-A-Long Droopy - (1954)\nHomesteader Droopy - (1954)\nDixieland Droopy - (1954)\nDeputy Droopy - (1955)\nMillionaire Droopy - (1956)\nGrin And Share It - (1957)\nBlackboard Jumble - (1957)\nOne Droopy Knight - (1957)\nSheep Wrecked - (1958)\nMutts About Racing - (1958)\nDroopy Leprechaun - (1958)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n                             HYPERDRIVE25 TORRENT\n___________________________________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c19063cdecd20f6c311b58fa71a9e632122458","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Droopy+Cartoon+Collection+%5BHyperdrive25%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c19063cdecd20f6c311b58fa71a9e632122458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,193,144,99,205,236,210,15,108,49,27,88,250,113,169,230,50,18,36,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
