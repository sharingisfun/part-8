The show depicts his metamorphosis from inoffensive chemistry teacher to feared drug lord and remorseless killer. Driven at first by the desire to save his family from destitution, he risks losing his family altogether because of his new life of crime.\n\nIn defiance of the tradition that viewers demand a TV character who never changes, Breaking Bad is all about the process of change, with each scene carrying forward the morphing of Walter White into the terrible Heisenberg.\n\nCan a person be transformed as the result of a few key life choices? Does everyone have the potential to be a ruthless criminal? How will we respond to the knowledge that we will be dead in six months? Is human life subject to laws as remorseless as chemical equations? When does injustice validate brutal retaliation? Why are drug addicts unsuitable for operating the illegal drug business? How can TV viewers remain loyal to a series where the hero becomes the villain? Does HeisenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Principle of Uncertainty rule our destinies?\n\nIn Breaking Bad and Philosophy, a hand-picked squad of professional thinkers investigate the crimes of Walter White, showing how this story relates to the major themes of philosophy and the major life decisions facing all of us.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Popular Culture and Philosophy (Book 67)\nPaperback: 288 pages\nPublisher: Open Court (July 10, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0812697642\nISBN-13: 978-0812697643\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd067843eaea4c772861914ccdc7e9f7b4807007","amp;dn":"Breaking+Bad+and+Philosophy%3A+Badder+Living+through+Chemistry+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd067843eaea4c772861914ccdc7e9f7b4807007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,6,120,67,234,234,76,119,40,97,145,76,205,199,233,247,180,128,112,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
