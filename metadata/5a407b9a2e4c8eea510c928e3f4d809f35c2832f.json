M. Barrie (Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet), Illustrator Arthur Rackham\n\nDescription: (courtesy of Goodreads)\n\nBefore he flew away to Neverland, the little boy who wouldn't grow up dwelt in the heart of London, with birds and fairies as his companions. This whimsical romp introduces Peter Pan, who discovered the magic of everyday existence amid the trees and flowers of Kensington Gardens Ã¢â‚¬â€ the very place where J. M. Barrie met the children who inspired his classic stories.\n\nAcclaimed by the Times of London as Ã¢â‚¬Å“one of the most charming books ever written,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ BarrieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantasy was published in 1907 with 50 stunning color illustrations by Arthur Rackham. This magnificent keepsake edition features all of RackhamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s winsome images of PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures. Readers of all ages will delight in following the exuberant child as he sets sail in a boat built by thrushes from an island in the Serpentine to the enchanted Kensington Gardens, where fairies dance to the music of his pan-pipes and teach him to fly.\n\n\nNote: This ebook was created and tested with the following applications:\n\nSigil, Calibre and Kindle for PC, Microsoft Word and Paint, Picasa and Snagit, Kindle Previewer, Moon+ Reader, Aldiko and Kindle for Android.\n\nSources include: The Gutenberg Project for the text and initial first images (https://www.gutenberg.org); Penguin Classics 2004 edition of Peter and Wendy and Peter Pan in Kensington; Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA (http://pds.lib.harvard.edu)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a407b9a2e4c8eea510c928e3f4d809f35c2832f","amp;dn":"Peter+Pan+in+Kensington+Gardens+ebook+by+J.+M.+Barrie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a407b9a2e4c8eea510c928e3f4d809f35c2832f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,64,123,154,46,76,142,234,81,12,146,142,63,77,128,159,53,194,131,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
