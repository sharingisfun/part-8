These guys are basically flown to the sickest places on the planet (New Zealand, Jackson Hole, Canada, Alaska) to create fresh lines after being dropped from helicopters. The aerial camera-work is solid, and the film includes beautiful shots of the mountains and the wildlife in these areas. The sponsors definitely paid up for this one; the guys are hitting massive kickers on otherwise untouched slopes.\n\nNo wasted time on rails and jibs. Just big mountain riding and big air. There is a short segments which shows the guys at different big air competitions as well - those could be left out.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f19ed58eac3972e6357c0cddbeff5de813c05c","amp;dn":"Thats_It_Thats_All","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f19ed58eac3972e6357c0cddbeff5de813c05c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,241,158,213,142,172,57,114,230,53,124,12,221,190,255,93,232,19,192,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
