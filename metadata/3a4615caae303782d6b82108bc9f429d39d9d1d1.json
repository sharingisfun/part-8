Apichatpong Weerasethakul)\nAn impressionistic diary of his doctor parents&amp;#039; courtship, director Apichatpong Weerasethakul&amp;#039;s picture evolves in two parts (feminine/masculine?), with events repeated in each against opposing backdrops: natural/rural vs. industrial/urban. Its suggestion of autobiography (the parents&amp;#039; memories are the stated structure, such as it is) tantalizes like the title of an Ezra Pound poem--an external prod just as, Weerasethakul suggests, all of our reactions to film are essentially personal and intrinsically separate from the film itself. That doesn&amp;#039;t stop it from being oblique, however, as unconcerned with narrative sense as it is with texture. There&amp;#039;s the thought in here that the past is Narcissus&amp;#039; pool, a reflection of the dark present: we never seem to learn from the past, but dip too long and it ossifies any illusion of progress.\n\nEnglish Hardsubs\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4615caae303782d6b82108bc9f429d39d9d1d1","amp;dn":"Sang+sattawat+-+Syndromes+and+a+century+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4615caae303782d6b82108bc9f429d39d9d1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,70,21,202,174,48,55,130,214,184,33,8,188,159,66,157,57,217,209,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
