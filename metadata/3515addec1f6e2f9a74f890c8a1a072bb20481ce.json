Earle is signed to Bloodshot Records and has four released albums from 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2010. He currently resides in New York City's East Village\n\n\nJustin Townes Earle grew up in South Nashville, Tennessee with his mother, Carol Ann Hunter Earle. Earle began using drugs when he was barely 12 years old,[3] developing a serious addiction by the late 90's. In his teens he began playing and singing with two different Nashville bands, a rock band called the Distributors and a bluegrass-influenced acoustic combo, the Swindlers. Earle spent some time as guitarist and keyboardist for his father's touring band the Dukes, but was fired after a dangerous appetite for drugs began interfering with his performances. Once he came off hard drugs, he began putting a new focus on his music and songwriting.\n\n\nEarle presently tours heavily and played Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival (2008), Grand Ole Opry (March 2008), Historical WSM, South By Southwest (2008-2010), the historic Beacon Theater (May 2009), Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion (September, 2009), Bonnaroo (2009) Bumbershoot (2010) and the Bowery Ballroom (March 2010) with Chicago-based singer/songwriter Joe Pug. In the summer of 2009, Earle co-billed The Big Surprise Tour with Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Old Crow Medicine Show, and The Felice Brothers.[5] In May 2010, he appeared alongside his father in an episode of the HBO television series Treme.\n\nEarle returned to rehab after he was arrested for battery, public drunkenness, and resisting arrest on September 16, 2010[6] following a dispute with a concert venue about his pay.[7] He resumed touring on Nov. 26, 2010 in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nIn September 2009, Justin Townes Earle received an Americana Music Award for Emerging Artist of the Year. He also received nominations for album of the year (Midnight at the Movies) and for artist of the year. He had been previously nominated for Emerging Artist of the Year in 2008. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Good Life 2008\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nHard Livin'\nThe Good Life\nWho Am I To Say\nLone Pine Hill\nSouth Georgia Sugar Babe\nWhat Do You Do When You're Lonesome\nTurn Out My Lights\nLonesome And You\nAin't Glad I'm Leaving\nFar Away In Another Town\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarlem River Blues 2010\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nHarlem River Blues\nOne More Night In Brooklyn\nMove Over Mama\nWorkin' For The MTA\nWanderin'\nSlippin' and Slidin'\nChristchurch Woman\nLearning To Cry\nAin't Waitin'\nRogers Park\nHarlem River Blues Reprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3515addec1f6e2f9a74f890c8a1a072bb20481ce","amp;dn":"Justin+Townes+Earle+-+2+Albums+2008+-+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3515addec1f6e2f9a74f890c8a1a072bb20481ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,21,173,222,193,246,226,249,167,79,137,12,138,26,7,43,178,4,129,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
