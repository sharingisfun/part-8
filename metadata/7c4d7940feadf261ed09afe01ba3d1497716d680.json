The album includes two previously unreleased tracks, Moyet's version of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;Solid Wood&quot;, as well as a number of hits from the singer's stint in 80s electro-pop band Yazoo. The album was re-released by Sony the following year as a two-disc set, Singles/Live, the second disc being a live recording of Alison on tour.\n\nAll Music Review by Tom Demalon - Alison Moyet had over a decade of international success behind her, first with Vince Clarke in Yaz and then solo, and her Singles set served as a timely retrospective upon its 1995 release. The selection of tracks is balanced evenly and arranged chronologically (save for the inclusion of the unreleased cover of &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; that kicks things off), opening with three Yaz cuts, including the classic &quot;Only You&quot; and the dramatic &quot;Winter Kills.&quot; Numbering among the highlights of this strong compilation are the gorgeous blue-eyed soul of &quot;Invisible&quot; (her biggest U.S. hit), the buoyant &quot;Is This Love?,&quot; and the aching &quot;This House.&quot; Singles deftly mixes originals and covers (Moyet's canny take on Jules Shear's &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; is another standout), and the four unreleased tracks will delight fans. With most of her hits present, this serves as a definitive and nearly flawless gathering of the best of Moyet's classy catalog.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n[02] Only You\n[03] Nobody's Diary\n[04] Situation\n[05] Love Resurrection\n[06] All Cried Out\n[07] Invisible\n[08] That Ole Devil Called Love\n[09] Is This Love\n[10] Weak In The Presence Of Beauty\n[11] Ordinary Girl\n[12] Love Letters\n[13] It Won't Be Long\n[14] Wishing You Were Here\n[15] This House\n[16] Falling\n[17] Whispering Your Name\n[18] Getting Into Something\n[19] Ode To Boy II\n[20] Solid Wood\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:13m:07s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Getting Into Something\n[02] Chain Of Fools\n[03] Love Letters\n[04] All Cried Out\n[05] Dorothy\n[06] Falling\n[07] Ode To Boy\n[08] Is This Love\n[09] Nobody's Diary\n[10] Whispering Your Name\n[11] There Are Worse Things I Could Do\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:44m:53s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time............. 01h:58m:00s\nTotal File Size....................... 818mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
