It is one of the best-known and most influential prescriptive treatment of English grammar and usage, and often is required reading in U.S. high school and university composition classes. The original 1918 edition of The Elements of Style detailed eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa few matters of formÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and a list of commonly &quot;misused&quot; words and expressions. This book, printed as a private edition in 1918 for the use of his students, became a classic on the local campus, known as &quot;the little book&quot;, and its successive editions have since sold over ten million copies. This version is based on the public-domain text from 1918, which was originally uploaded to Wikibooks and wikified by Wikibooks:User:Lord Emsworth in 2003. In January 2006, Kernigh transwikied the text from Wikibooks:Elements of Style to Wikisource. (Summary by Wikipedia and Wikisource)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fc4b4658b2694f7117dad781e51d7f23bcfe5de","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Elements+of+Style+by+William+Strunk+Jr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fc4b4658b2694f7117dad781e51d7f23bcfe5de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,196,180,101,139,38,148,247,17,125,173,120,30,81,215,242,59,207,229,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
