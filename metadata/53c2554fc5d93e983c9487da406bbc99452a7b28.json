SpeedEDIT streamlines the editing process by eliminating unnecessary steps. All editing functions are performed directly on native clips, avoiding the need to transcode or pre-trim content. SpeedEDIT 2 further accelerates the editing process by dynamically linking Storyboard and Timeline, providing the ability to perform many common functions in fewer steps. Ripple edits, clip replacement, segment repositioning, 3D video rotation, color correction, animated titles and image sequence playback are just a few of the everyday tasks that SpeedEDIT 2 performs faster than any other professional editor.\n\nSpeedEDIT 2 works smoothly and natively with MPEG-2, AVI, QuickTimeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and most popular video formats in both HD or SD. Enjoy real-time, full resolution on-screen HD previews with IEEE 1394 (FireWireÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®) output to camera or deck. Any broadcast, DVD or Web production can benefit from the clean design, streamlined operation, and pristine output offered in SpeedEDIT 2.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c2554fc5d93e983c9487da406bbc99452a7b28","amp;dn":"NewTek+SpeedEdit+v2.0+%5Bak%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c2554fc5d93e983c9487da406bbc99452a7b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,194,85,79,197,217,62,152,60,148,135,218,64,107,188,153,69,42,123,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
