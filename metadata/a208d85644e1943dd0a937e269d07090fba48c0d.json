At the time of its release, it was viewed as a critical and commercial failure, but over time, it's become a cult favorite. Next month, that album will be celebrated on a brief tour where it'll be performed note-for-note by a supergroup featuring Beach House, plus members of Fleet Foxes, Grizzly Bear, the Walkmen, and more.\nThe band will include Beach House's Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally. Lead vocal duties will be handled by Fleet Foxes' Robin Pecknold, Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen, the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser, Iain Matthews of Plainsong/Fairport Convention, and Legrand. The rest of the band features Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, plus members of Lower Dens, Cass McCombs' band, Celebration, and Mt. Royal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a208d85644e1943dd0a937e269d07090fba48c0d","amp;dn":"Gene+Clark+No+Other+Band+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a208d85644e1943dd0a937e269d07090fba48c0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,8,216,86,68,225,148,61,208,169,55,226,105,208,112,144,251,164,140,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
