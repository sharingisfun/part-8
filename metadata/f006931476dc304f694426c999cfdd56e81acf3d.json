The unifying theme is that security markets are nearly efficient, meaning that most securities are priced appropriately given their risk and return attributes. The content places greater emphasis on asset allocation and offers a much broader and deeper treatment of futures, options, and other derivative security markets than most investment texts. McGraw-Hill's adaptive learning component, LearnSmart, provides assignable modules that help students master chapter core concepts and come to class more prepared. In addition, resources within Connect Plus help students solve financial problems and apply what they've learned. Bodie Investments' blend of practical and theoretical coverage combines with a complete digital solution to help your students achieve higher outcomes in the course.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPart I Introduction\nChapter: 1 The Investment Environment\nChapter: 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments\nChapter: 3 How Securities are Traded\nChapter: 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies\nPart II Portfolio Theory and Practice\nChapter: 5 Risk, Return, and the Historical Record\nChapter: 6 Capital Allocation to Risky Assets\nChapter: 7 Optimal Risky Portfolios\nChapter: 8 Index Models\nPart III Equilibrium in Capital Markets\nChapter: 9 The Capital Asset Pricing Model\nChapter: 10 Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return\nChapter: 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis\nChapter: 12 Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis\nChapter: 13 Empirical Evidence on Security Returns\nPart IV Fixed-Income Securities\nChapter: 14 Bond Prices and Yields\nChapter: 15 The Term Structure of Interest Rates\nChapter: 16 Managing Bond Portfolios\nPart V Security Analysis\nChapter: 17 Macroeconomic and Industry Analysis\nChapter: 18 Equity Valuation Models\nChapter: 19 Financial Statement Analysis\nPart VI Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives\nChapter: 20 Options Markets: Introduction\nChapter: 21 Option Valuation\nChapter: 22 Futures Markets\nChapter: 23 Futures, Swaps, and Risk Management\nPart VII Applied Portfolio Management\nChapter: 24 Portfolio Performance Evaluation\nChapter: 25 International Diversification\nChapter: 26 Hedge Funds\nChapter: 27 The Theory of Active Portfolio Management\nChapter: 28 Investment Policy and the Framework of the CFA Institute\nReferences to CFA Problems\nGlossary\nName Index\nSubject Index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f006931476dc304f694426c999cfdd56e81acf3d","amp;dn":"Investments%2C+10th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f006931476dc304f694426c999cfdd56e81acf3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,6,147,20,118,220,48,79,105,68,38,201,153,207,221,86,232,26,207,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
