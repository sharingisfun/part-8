With the townspeople aghast at the &quot;scooter-trash&quot; invading Buford, the Sherrif, under the direction of Hogg, try to get the bikers out of town while they try to organize a &quot;Wetland Run&quot; aimed at making enough money to pay off the back taxes that threaten Ironbutt's claim to the land. Bear gets kidnapped by Calvin's over- zealous son Blue, and again it's up to Bone to save his buddy.\n\nNote this is ENGLISH audio... not my rip, but helping out because this is a hard to find movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f3ca10a479a714d253460d6251fdfdc9356a087","amp;dn":"Running+Cool+%281993%29+DVDRip.+FS.+XviD.+MPEG.+2ch.+MovieExtreme.av","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f3ca10a479a714d253460d6251fdfdc9356a087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,60,161,10,71,154,113,77,37,52,96,214,37,31,223,220,147,86,160,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
