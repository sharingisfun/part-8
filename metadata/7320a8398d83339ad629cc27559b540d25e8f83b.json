It does have some small focus issues during reel changes, and at 2 hours 9 minutes, Sony really should have bumped it up to a DVD9.  I think the sound is also a clear improvement.\n\nAh, Capucine, all other skills disregarded, her quavering voice, her glossy rapture...\n\nGeorge Cukor took over as director upon the death of Charles Vidor.\n\nLiszt (that's who this story is about) was really a man before his time. Audience members grabbing at his limbs in adoration, the eternal final concert, the stagey affectations, etc.  Favorite quote from a manager:\n\n&quot;We could make a fortune every time you retire.&quot;\n\nDid G.G. Allin have such encouragement from his manager? Did he even benefit from a manager?\n\nUncompressed DVD5 VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7320a8398d83339ad629cc27559b540d25e8f83b","amp;dn":"Vidor+-+Cukor+-+Bogarde+-+Capucine+-+Song+Without+End+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7320a8398d83339ad629cc27559b540d25e8f83b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,32,168,57,141,131,51,154,214,41,204,39,85,155,84,13,37,232,248,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
