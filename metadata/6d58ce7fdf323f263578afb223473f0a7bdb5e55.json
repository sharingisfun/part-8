Here it is marked separately as its own track.  But the track listing on the sleeve doesn't mention it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d58ce7fdf323f263578afb223473f0a7bdb5e55","amp;dn":"Current+93+-+Thunder+Perfect+Mind+%281992%29+%28folk%29+%28mp3%29+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d58ce7fdf323f263578afb223473f0a7bdb5e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,88,206,127,223,50,63,38,53,120,175,178,35,71,63,10,123,219,94,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
