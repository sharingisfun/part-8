Flavors covered include those used in food and beverages, tobacco flavorings, alcoholic beverages, and pet and animal foods. Comparative flavor chemistry is used to evaluate and describe homologous groups of similar chemical structures. Author and flavor chemist De Rovira has collated the G.R.A.S. ingredients into chemically similar groups, where those structural relationships would dictate flavor attribute similarities, allowing predictable aroma types that can be more easily recalled and developed. Coverage in the second edition is extended to include the many significant and recent changes in the fields of flavor chemistry, food technology, and regulatory. Definitions of many items are expanded and inclusion of new items is extensive.\n\nPlz Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae69f71751d098259709c989d8f3a0421623792","amp;dn":"Dictionary_of_Flavors+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae69f71751d098259709c989d8f3a0421623792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,230,159,113,117,29,9,130,89,112,156,152,157,143,58,4,33,98,55,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
