Her first assignment: cover a bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charity auction. Unfortunately, she accidentally bids for a date with a handsome bear shifter, and worse, finds out her date is with the jerk whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been rudely refusing her interview requests.\n\nBut soon sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have bigger things to worry about Ã¢â‚¬â€œlike why people are vanishing from Blue Moon Junction without a trace, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really buying up all the swampland around Blue Moon Junction, and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind the bear shifterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sudden change of heart. The deeper she digs, the closer she comes to a terrifying truth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and to losing the love of a bear who may just be her fated mate.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6045715db1616a7fcf6b7ea065d1c5f31f24062e","amp;dn":"Hard+To+Bear+by+Georgette+St.+Clair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6045715db1616a7fcf6b7ea065d1c5f31f24062e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,69,113,93,177,97,106,127,207,107,126,160,101,209,197,243,31,36,6,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
