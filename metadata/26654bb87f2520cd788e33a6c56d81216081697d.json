Katy is gone. Taken. Everything becomes about finding her. Taking out anyone who stands in his way? Done. Burning down the whole world to save her? Gladly. Exposing his alien race to the world? With pleasure.\n\nAll Katy can do is survive.\nSurrounded by enemies, the only way she can come out of this is to adapt. After all, there are sides of Daedalus that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem entirely crazy, but the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s goals are frightening and the truths they speak even more disturbing. Who are the real bad guys? Daedalus? Mankind? Or the Luxen?\n\nTogether, they can face anything. But the most dangerous foe has been there all along, and when the truths are exposed and the lies come crumbling down, which side will Daemon and Katy be standing on? And will they even be together?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26654bb87f2520cd788e33a6c56d81216081697d","amp;dn":"Origin_by_Jennifer_L._Armentrout__Lux_Series__4_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26654bb87f2520cd788e33a6c56d81216081697d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,101,75,184,127,37,32,205,120,142,51,166,197,109,129,33,96,129,105,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
