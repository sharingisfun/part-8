Take your pick: be a Colonial Marine, a\nPredator or an Alien. Fight through suspense-filled environments: from\nstarships and space stations to colonial bases and eerie planetscapes. One\nwrong move turns you from hunter to prey.\n\nThree campaigns: Colonial Marine, Alien and Predator\n\nIncludes all the levels from the original AvP Gold Edition plus the\nMillennium Expansion Pack\n\nSkirmish mode against infinite Alien hordes\n\nBonus Episodes\n\nUnique abilities, weapons and equipment for each species\n\nScale walls and elevator shafts as an ALIEN with frightening speed as you\nattack and devour your victims\n\nStalk your prey as the deadly PREDATOR using wrist blades, shoulder\ncannons and stealth mode\n\nLock and load as a COLONIAL MARINE using motion trackers, grenade\nlaunchers and flame-throwers to exterminate your foes\n\nSupports Xbox 360 Controller for Windows\n\nMusic from the original soundtrack CD\n\nMultiplayer thru Steam\n\nNOTE: The latest update v1.05 has been integrated in this release.\nComplete changelog below.\n\nVersion 1.05\n\n# Fixed Alien tail attack crash in MP games\n# Fixed rare crash in Last Man Standing\n# Fixed problems with getting the wrong players name when someone leaves\n# Fixed clip bug on aspect ratios other than 4:3\n# Fixed so game now loads the last used MP config on entering MP menu\n# Survivor always uses Steam name\n# Added Host private game option\n# Re-enabled custom map support\n# Simplified menus for Joystick controls\n# Fixed some rare singleplayer crashes\n\nVersion 1.04\n\n# Integrated with Steam overlay\n# Uses Steam name\n# Host/join games via bare-bones in-game lobby browser\n# Can invite and join friends and other players via the Steam overlay\n# Game attempts host migration\n# Supports windowed mode with -w command line switch\n\nVersion 1.03\n\n# Improved HUD scaling for the Marine and Predator. Now HUDs dont\ndominate the screen so much at high resolutions, and they also work\ncorrectly with extreme widescreen displays (e.g. an Eyefinity three\nmonitor 48:9 setup).\n# Rewritten D3D9 initialisation and video mode select. Now more\nstreamlined and without legacy DX6/DX7 redundancies (less chance to fail\non modern drivers).\n\nVersion 1.02\n\n# Fix for video resolution menu on German version\n\nVersion 1.01\n\n# Proper widescreen support. Previously the game allowed non-4:3 video\nmodes (e.g. 1920x1080) but just rendered a stretched 4:3 image. Now the\ngame renders at the correct aspect ratio (e.g. 5:4, 16:9, 16:10), with\nthe vertical f-o-v remaining fixed and the horizontal field-of-view\nchanging accordingly. (i.e. 16:9 modes now render more to the sides than\na 4:3 mode).\n# By popular demand, added an -unlimitedsaves command line option. By\nlaunching the game with -unlimitedsaves in the command line, players can\nnow save as many times as they like, rather than being restricted to a\nset number of saves per level.\n# Replaced timer code with a new high-resolution version for improved\naccuracy.\n# Frame-rate now locks to a maximum of 120 to fix gameplay issues when\nrunning at very high rates (e.g. when vsync is disabled).\n# Mouse sensitivity/accuracy improvements for mice with a high poll rate.\n# Fix for invalid characters in device name in video resolution menu\ncausing rendering problems.\n# Fix for crash on machines without a sound card / where the sound drivers\nare invalid. (Game will now run correctly with no sound.)\n\n\n\nBurn/mount, install, copy crack, then play\n\nGreetz: LARGEiSO and MEDIUMiSO\n\n\n\n(C) E/dfs\nSIZE DOES NOT MATTER!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb539bd7d891e9ac8487bce0f7c2a71eec3610f","amp;dn":"Aliens.Versus.Predator.Classic.2000-TiNYiSO+%28No+Rar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb539bd7d891e9ac8487bce0f7c2a71eec3610f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,181,57,189,125,137,30,154,200,72,123,206,15,124,42,113,238,195,97,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
