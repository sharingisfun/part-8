When Philip Swallow, lecturer in English at Rummidge, changes places with flamboyant Morris Zapp of Euphoric State University, USA, trouble ensues. Then, ten years on, older but not noticeably wiser, they are let loose on the international conference circuit - a veritable academic carnival. And finally, Dr Robyn Penrose becomes part of a scheme to learn about industry instead of reading about it, with hilarious results. David Lodge exposes the dizzy pursuit of knowledge - literary, commercial, romantic and erotic - with unparalleled wit and insight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:699dedb25eaee059ece2cebd35da589a9081609f","amp;dn":"The+Campus+Trilogy+-+David+Lodge.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"699dedb25eaee059ece2cebd35da589a9081609f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,157,237,178,94,174,224,89,236,226,206,189,53,218,88,154,144,129,96,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
