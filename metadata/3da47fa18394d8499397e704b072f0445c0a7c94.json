This Rough Guide is jam-packed with some of the biggest hitters in highlife history. Enjoy Victor Uwaifo's Nigerian joromi stylings, the gentle Ghanaian palm-wine of Koo Nimo, and even an early recording of Afrobeat superstar Fela Kuti presenting a firmly highlife vibe. The bonus CD is extremely special. Three virtuoso musicians have shared their ideas and passion to re-explore the traditional sounds of the seprewa and origins of highlife in an acoustic contemporary setting, with breathtaking results. \n\n ''A treat of a compiliation CD with a gem of a bonus CD. The music is extremely pleasant and makes fine back ground music.''\n\nCompilation CD\n01. Fela Ransome-Kuti And His Koola Lobitos - Highlife Time\n02.
