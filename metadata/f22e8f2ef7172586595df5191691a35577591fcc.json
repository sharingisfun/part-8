The long-awaited release of the original theatrical incarnations of the classic Star Wars trilogy.\nIn response to overwhelming demand, Lucasfilm Ltd. and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment has released an attractively, individual release of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. That means you'll be able to enjoy Star Wars as it first appeared in 1977, Empire in 1980, and Jedi in 1983. \n\n\nSee the title crawl to Star Wars before it was known as Episode IV; see the pioneering, if dated, motion control model work on the attack on the Death Star; groove to Lapti Nek or the Ewok Celebration song like you did when you were a kid; and yes, see Han Solo shoot first. \n\n\n&quot;Over the years, a truly countless number of fans have told us that they would love to see and own the original version that they remember experiencing in theaters,&quot; said Jim Ward, President of LucasArts and Senior Vice President of Lucasfilm Ltd. &quot;We returned to the Lucasfilm Archives to search exhaustively for source material that could be presented on DVD. This is something that we're very excited to be able to give to fans in response to their continuing enthusiasm for Star Wars. Topping it off with a new interactive adventure makes September 12 (2006) a red-letter day for Star Wars fans.&quot;\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\nDirected By: George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Richard Marquand.\n\nRuntime: Star Wars - 2 Hours, 1 Minute, 7 Seconds.\n\nRuntime: The Empire Strikes Back -  2 Hours, 4 Minutes, 53 Seconds\n\nRuntime: Return Of The Jedi - 2 Hours, 11 Minutes, 42 Seconds.\n\nGenre: Action / Adventure / Fantasy / Science Fiction\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSubtitles: English (Required subtitles when alien speaks)\n\nColor: Color\n\nResolution: 720 x 480 (Approximately)\n\nFormat: Original Widescreen Presentation ( Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 )\n\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital 2.0\n\nSystem: NTSC\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n                          Ripped &amp; Encoded By Legendarien\n                          ===============================\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22e8f2ef7172586595df5191691a35577591fcc","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Trilogy+%28The+Original+Theatrical+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22e8f2ef7172586595df5191691a35577591fcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,46,143,46,247,23,37,134,89,93,245,25,22,145,163,85,119,89,31,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
