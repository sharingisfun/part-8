Enhanced means the bikes and ambient sounds have been boosted so you can actually hear them as well as the English commentary. The broadcasters obviously feel that it's all about the commentators and it's been getting worse every year. I played a video with standard audio track for someone and they asked me what was wrong with the sounds since they couldn't hear the motorcycles. \r\n\r\nI've enhanced the first part of the MotoGP season (thru Brno). If there is enough interest, I'll upload a few more. My Internet upload speed is pretty slow, so it takes a while to upload files of this size.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nFormat                                   : Matroska\r\nFile size                                : 3.79 GB\r\nDuration                                 : 1h 9mn\r\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 7800 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nBit rate                                 : 6263 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 1280 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate                               : 50.000 fps\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nLanguage                                 : English\r\nDefault                                  : Yes\r\n\r\nAudio 1\r\nFormat                                   : FLAC\r\nBit rate                                 : 766 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nTitle                                    : Enhanced\r\nLanguage                                 : English\r\nDefault                                  : Yes\r\n\r\nAudio 2\r\nFormat                                   : AC-3\r\nBit rate                                 : 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nTitle                                    : MotoGP\r\nLanguage                                 : English\r\nDefault                                  : No\r\n\r\nAudio 3\r\nFormat                                   : AC-3\r\nBit rate                                 : 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nTitle                                    : Ambient\r\nDefault                                  : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69df3008e549397c9fd49dc41d29e90531881336","amp;dn":"MotoGP+2016+Round+06+Mugello+720p+50fps+Enhanced+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69df3008e549397c9fd49dc41d29e90531881336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,223,48,8,229,73,57,124,159,212,157,196,29,41,233,5,49,136,19,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
