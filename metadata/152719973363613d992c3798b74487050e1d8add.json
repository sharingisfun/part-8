All of them are great and should satisfy the needs of thrash/death enthusiasts.\n\nThe fourth is an interesting compilation. Both first albums remastered, and a 2011 remix of &quot;Pray&quot; (mind you, it's no techno bullshit - pure metal, but with freshly remixed sound). In short: one new version of the first CD and two versions of the second.\n\n\n1. (1992) Solstice\n2. (1995) Pray\n3. (2009) To Dust\n4. (2012) Pray For The Sentencing (Compilation)\n\n\nDownload it, enjoy, seed, and comment.\nSee ya!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152719973363613d992c3798b74487050e1d8add","amp;dn":"Solstice+-+MP3+Discography+%281992-2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152719973363613d992c3798b74487050e1d8add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,39,25,151,51,99,97,61,153,44,55,152,183,68,135,5,14,29,138,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
