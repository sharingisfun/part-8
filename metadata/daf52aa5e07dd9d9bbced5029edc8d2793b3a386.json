It rewrites the problems as abstract Cauchy problems or evolution equations, and then solves them by the technique of elementary difference equations. Because of this, the volume assumes less background and provides an easy approach for readers to understand.\n\nReadership: Mathematical graduate students and researchers in the area of Analysis and Differential Equations. It is also good for engineering graduate students and researchers who are interested in parabolic partial differential equations.\n\nPublisher: World Scientific Publishing Company (October 22, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9814616389\nISBN-13: 978-9814616386","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf52aa5e07dd9d9bbced5029edc8d2793b3a386","amp;dn":"%5BChin-Yuan+Lin%5DAn+Exponential+Function+Approach+to+Parabolic+Equ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf52aa5e07dd9d9bbced5029edc8d2793b3a386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,245,42,165,224,125,217,217,187,206,213,2,158,220,141,39,147,179,163,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
