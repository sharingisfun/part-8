Be good or Be Hurt, BIATCHES\n\nPEACE YouKnowHim\n\n\nSee what makes Skid Row tick, a tell all, never before seen, raw documentary about the harsh reality of the street life in Los Scandalous - Skid Row. The homeless capital of The United States. Watch through my lens, as I show the true gutter life in Los Angeles; from prostitution, homelessness, hard addiction, the drug dealers perspective, police corruption and the system designed to keep them all there. My name is Shanks Rajendran and I'm a 28 year old Australian filmmaker. I shot this documentary to uncover the truth about Skid Row, the people, the place, and the politics behind it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8b8ca051031a03b6f70bd8b687eb5f8e9fc4da6","amp;dn":"Los+Scandalous+-+Skid+Row+%282014%29+-+YKH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8b8ca051031a03b6f70bd8b687eb5f8e9fc4da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,184,202,5,16,49,160,59,111,112,189,139,104,126,181,248,233,252,77,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
