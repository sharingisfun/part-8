Pour 'Em Kinda Strong\n\n\nLike jeggings for men and the upcoming reboot of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ALF,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ gallows-humored, apocalypse-minded Canadian singer-songwriters are, apparently, an idea whose time has come.\n\nSelf-described Ã¢â‚¬Å“dissident countryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ singer Corb Lund has been nibbling at the margins of success since his 1995 debut; his seventh and latest studio disc, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cabin Fever,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ feels like a breakthrough at last. Written Bon Iver-style in a backwoods cabin outside of Edmonton, Canada, and recorded live-to-tape with his band, the HurtinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Albertans, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cabin FeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a doozy Ã¢â‚¬â€ a soft-hearted, ice-pick-eyed album that toggles between old-school honky-tonk and rambling, misfit folk.\n\nOpening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“GettinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Down on the MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers a guide to survival when the petrol runs out (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think I see a rip in the social fabricÃ¢â‚¬â€°/ Brother, can you pass the ammo?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) and makes a case for Lund as the spiritual offspring of Molly Ivins and Hayes Carll.\n\nThe latter shows up in human form on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bible on the Dash,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ about a touring band that relies on a purloined copy of the Good Book to get out of speeding tickets (Ã¢â‚¬Å“My foot is heavy with redemptionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and worse.\n\nLund is a revelation, laconic and scary smart, with a devilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye for details. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cabin FeverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ flags only occasionally. Even the pulpy Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Gothest Girl I CanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Priceless Antique Pistol Shoots Startled OwnerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Despite my injuries good sirÃ¢â‚¬â€°/ I cannot lieÃ¢â‚¬â€°/ It remains an elegant and stylish way to dieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), with its Olympic-caliber yodeling, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live up to the promise of their titles.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef52f680f371638a9eec13bccf8904ff57ba9173","amp;dn":"Corb+Lund+Band+-+Cabin+Fever+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef52f680f371638a9eec13bccf8904ff57ba9173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,82,246,128,243,113,99,138,158,236,19,188,207,137,4,255,87,186,145,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
