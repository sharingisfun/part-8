Its history in the role of the Process Industries has been quite honorable, and techniques and products have contributed to improve health, welfare and quality of life. Today, industrial enterprises, which are still a major source of wealth, have to deal with new challenges in a global world. They need to reconsider their strategy taking into account environmental constraints, social requirements, profit, competition, and resource depletion.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Systems thinkingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a prerequisite from process development at the lab level to good project management. New manufacturing concepts have to be considered, taking into account LCA, supply chain management, recycling, plant flexibility, continuous development, process intensification and innovation.\nThis book combines experience from academia and industry in the field of industrialization, i.e. in all processes involved in the conversion of research into successful operations. Enterprises are facing major challenges in a world of fierce competition and globalization. Process engineering techniques provide Process Industries with the necessary tools to cope with these issues. The chapters of this book give a new approach to the management of technology, projects and manufacturing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b139d83f49d1fd3f04d9e1e021c79823708234c","amp;dn":"Process+Engineering+and+Industrial+Management","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b139d83f49d1fd3f04d9e1e021c79823708234c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,19,157,131,244,157,31,211,240,77,158,30,2,28,121,130,55,8,35,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
