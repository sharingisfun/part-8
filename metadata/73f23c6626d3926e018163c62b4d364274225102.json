These people have often experienced lifelong underachievement; they feel misunderstood and have not received the help they need. Reflecting the growing awareness of this problem, ADHD in Adults provides a comprehensive account of the presentation of adulthood ADHD, its assessment and treatment.\n\n\nWritten by experienced practitioners in the field, the book introduces a cognitive behavioural model of ADHD from which the authors developed the Young-Bramham Programme. This is a unique, modular framework for assessing and treating people with adulthood ADHD and associated problems using practical intervention techniques. The book is accompanied by the Young-Bramham Programme Companion Website, www.wiley.com/go/adhdadults that provides downloadable materials for use by clients and therapists.\n\n\nADHD in Adults is invaluable reading for clinicians working with adult ADHD clients in many different settings including primary care, adult mental health, learning disability, forensic, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology. It will also be a useful self-help resource for ADHD clients, friends, family and supporters. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f23c6626d3926e018163c62b4d364274225102","amp;dn":"ADHD+in+Adults+A+Psychological+Guide+to+Practice+%282006%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f23c6626d3926e018163c62b4d364274225102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,242,60,102,38,211,146,110,1,129,99,198,43,77,54,66,116,34,81,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
