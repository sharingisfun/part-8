It was originally released in December 1972, with a US release in April 1973, and became a commercial and critical success.\n\nThe band were well known for their strong stage act, and had privately recorded several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company decided it would be good for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not particularly interested in the album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.\n\nThe album was an immediate commercial success, particularly in the US, where it was accompanied by the top five hit, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, and became a steady seller throughout the 1970s.\n\n4 CD DELUXE EDITION + SINGLE DISC 1972 MIX REMASTER [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1: Osaka 15th August 1972\n\n    Highway Star\n    Smoke on The Water\n    Child In Time\n    The Mule (Drum Solo)\n    Strange Kind Of Woman\n    Lazy\n    Space TruckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nDisc 2: Osaka 16th August 1972\n\n    Highway Star\n    Smoke on The Water\n    Child In Time\n    The Mule (Drum Solo)\n    Strange Kind Of Woman\n    Lazy\n    Space TruckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nDisc 3: Tokyo 17th August 1972\n\n    Highway Star\n    Smoke on The Water\n    Child In Time\n    The Mule (Drum Solo)\n    Strange Kind Of Woman\n    Lazy\n    Space TruckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nDisc 4: Encores from all three nights\n\n    Black Night Ã¢â‚¬â€ Osaka, August 15\n    Speed King Ã¢â‚¬â€ Osaka, August 15\n    Black Night Ã¢â‚¬â€ Osaka, August 16\n    Lucille Ã¢â‚¬â€ Osaka, August 16\n    Black Night Ã¢â‚¬â€ Tokyo, August 17\n    Speed King Ã¢â‚¬â€ Tokyo, August 17\n\n1CD edition\n\n    2013 remaster of the original 1972 mix of the album\n\n \t&quot;Highway Star&quot;   \tOsaka on 16 August \t6:52[nb 1]\n\t&quot;Child in Time&quot;   \tOsaka on 16 August \t12:25\n \t&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;   \tOsaka on 15 August \t7:32\n\t&quot;The Mule&quot;   \tTokyo on 17 August \t9:50\n. \t&quot;Strange Kind of Woman&quot;   \tOsaka on 16 August \t9:36\n \t&quot;Lazy&quot;   \tTokyo on 17 August \t10:51\n\t&quot;Space Truckin'&quot;   \tOsaka on 16 August \t19:42\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:628da5f6540ff43567d57a269ab18472aa4760a1","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+In+Japan+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"628da5f6540ff43567d57a269ab18472aa4760a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,141,165,246,84,15,244,53,103,213,122,38,154,177,132,114,170,71,96,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
