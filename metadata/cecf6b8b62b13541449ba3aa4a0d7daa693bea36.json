Despite what many in the media would have you believe, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no such thing as a rainbow variety of orgasmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not sexually inadequate if you arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t having them every night, all night.\n\nWhether you plan to give or receive, believe us when we tell you that there is only one kind of orgasm. And this is very good news!\n\nOrgasms are simply the explosive release of sexual tension. How that tension is generated doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and humans (particularly females), in their vast sexual plasticity, can have an orgasm from nearly any kind of stimulation, given practice and a sexy context.\n\nMostly women have an orgasm via clitoral stimulationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn in a bit, the clitoris is everywhere you want it to be. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s VAST. Women can also have an orgasm via shallow or deep vaginal penetration, internal or external anal stimulation, inner thigh or breast stimulation, earlobes, toes, backs of the knees, small of the back, arches of the feetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ pretty much if thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sensation, you can learn to have orgasms from it. In fact, some women can even have an orgasm just by thinking about it.\n\nAnd orgasms can feel different, too. A g-spot generated orgasm can feel very different from a clitorally-generated orgasm. (YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about how to give and receive both in this guide.) Orgasms are as heterogeneous as women are.\n\nSo remember, there are lots of ways to generate sexual tension, but only one orgasmic response. Whatever way you get there is completely groovy, and if you want to learn how to give or get them in new ways, practice, practice practice.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what this guide is all about. You and your partner are going to learn loads about the female body and how it works, get to know your sexual response and arousal, discover how to locateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and stimulateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½your g-spot, and even explore fun, sexy stuff like multiple and simultaneous orgasms...............\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cecf6b8b62b13541449ba3aa4a0d7daa693bea36","amp;dn":"Female+Orgasms-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cecf6b8b62b13541449ba3aa4a0d7daa693bea36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,207,107,139,98,177,53,65,68,155,163,170,74,13,125,170,105,59,234,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
