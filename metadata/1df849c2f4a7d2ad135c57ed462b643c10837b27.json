Its content is based upon the Jake Gimbel Sex Psychology Lectures over which Dr. Berne presided at the University of California in April and May of 1966.\nOne reviewer compared Sex in Human Loving to the book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. While this comparison is somewhat accurate, Sex in Human Loving takes a more serious and academic approach to the subject of Sex. Berne addresses many topics, including sex education, the biology of sex, human relationships and sex, and sexual games. Berne discusses some sexual games that he described in Games People Play, but he also introduces some new sexual games and elaborates on other games from Games People Play, such as Rapo.\nThis book is recommended for those readers interested in a more in-depth discussion of sexual games, as well as a discussion of sex within the context of Transactional Analysis.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDr Eric Berne, as the originator of transactional analysis, was always recognized as an important innovator in the field, but it was not until his Games People Play became an international bestseller that his methods achieved wide popularity. In his writings, until his death in 1970, Dr Berne outlined the principles of his system in works such as Games People Play, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry, Sex in Human Loving, and Principles of Group Treatment. Dr Berne was a practicing psychiatrist in Carmel, California, and held many important posts in professional psychiatric organizations and clinics.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df849c2f4a7d2ad135c57ed462b643c10837b27","amp;dn":"Eric+Berne+-+Sex+In+Human+Loving+%5B1973%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df849c2f4a7d2ad135c57ed462b643c10837b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,248,73,194,244,167,210,173,19,92,87,237,70,43,100,60,16,131,123,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
