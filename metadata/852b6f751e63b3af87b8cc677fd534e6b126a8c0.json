The book provides unique links to industry applications in the upper crust, including petroleum and groundwater geology, which highlight the importance of structural geology in exploration and exploitation of petroleum and water resources. Topics range from faults and fractures forming near the surface to shear zones and folds of the deep crust. Students are engaged through examples and parallels drawn from practical everyday situations, enabling them to connect theory with practice. Containing numerous end-of-chapter problems, e-learning modules, and with stunning field photos and illustrations, this book provides the ultimate learning experience for all students of structural geology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852b6f751e63b3af87b8cc677fd534e6b126a8c0","amp;dn":"Structural+Geology+-+1st+Edition.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852b6f751e63b3af87b8cc677fd534e6b126a8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,43,111,117,30,99,179,175,135,184,204,103,127,213,52,230,177,38,168,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
