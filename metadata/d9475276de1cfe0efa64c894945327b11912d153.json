Each was the most popular at the time it first aired on television*. The data has been left in its original state, without any re-encoding. File names have also been unaltered so that the original source of each is clear and so that those who already downloaded each episode can start seeding immediately with minimal effort.\n\nsource: HDTV\nreleaser: KILLERS, LOL, ASAP\n\nresolution: 720x404*\nfile size: ~180 MiB*\nvideo encoding: x264\n\n\n*The only exception is episode 21. A few seconds of the most popular release of it were corrupted, so the second most popular version was used instead. This version happened to be 720p, so that's why it's so much bigger than the others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9475276de1cfe0efa64c894945327b11912d153","amp;dn":"Brooklyn+Nine-Nine+Season+2+HDTV+x264+various","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9475276de1cfe0efa64c894945327b11912d153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,71,82,118,222,28,254,14,250,100,200,148,148,83,39,177,25,18,209,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
