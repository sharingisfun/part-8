Will they succeed or will their owner's dreams remain an unfinished pile of timber, concrete and brick? Special features exclusive to the DVD include four 'revisited' sections and more.\n\n\n1)  Regency Villa \nKevin McCloud meets a woman determined to build the house of her dreams, an enormous Georgian-style mansion. Helen Saunders and her husband Mark Eisenstadt finally found the perfect plot of land in Farnham, and have spent years planning every aspect of their new home. Having undergone extensive preparation, they don't foresee too many problems, but once the build gets underway their dream soon turns into a nightmare.\n\n2)  New England Gable House \nKevin McCloud visits the Sussex Downs to follow the construction of a New England-style kit house bought and designed entirely on the internet. Self-builder Jane Warren loves the New England style, and when she discovered that she could replicate it in the UK by buying an entire kit house, she just had to have one. Will Jane realise her dream of celebrating her first anniversary with her new husband Willem Mulder, in her new home or will her New England kit house become a living hell?\n\n3)  Wool Mill \nKevin McCloud meets Chris and Jill Heleine, who have chosen to build their dream home in Huddersfield. Some time ago they bought a deserted textile mill, which they dream of giving a light, modern interior. The build has been organised like a military operation, their filing system has left nothing to chance and Chris will even be doing some of the work himself. But will their dream home turn out exactly as they expected?\n\n4)  Isolated Cottage \nKevin McCloud travels to Wales to visit Adrian and Corrina, who have decided that their first home will be a 300-year-old ruin. The cottage is set in the Brecon Beacons National Park, Corrina and Adrian have a very small budget and an enormous amount of work to do to return the ruin to its former glory but they are eager and seemingly undaunted by the scale of the project. But how will they cope when the elements suddenly turn on them?\n\n5)  Isolated Cottage Revisited \nKevin McCloud travels to Wales to revisit Adrian and Corrina\n\n6)  Cruciform House \nKevin McCloud meets Rupert and Julie Upton, who are building a very experimental idea in the Lambourn Valley. Their dream is to create an amazing cross-shaped house made of oak and glass, strikingly modern with the most superb views. But each piece of wood has to be custom made and the design itself is incredibly complex. Few people would have the courage to take on such an experimental build - will Rupert and Julie's bravery pay off?\n\n7)  Cruciform House Revisited \nKevin McCloud catches up with Rupert and Julie Upton. The three-year build on the picturesque slopes of the Berkshire Downs was wracked with hold-ups, set-backs and spiralling costs but the gardens have now been landscaped, and the timber frame has aged in colour from honey to silver as the property settles down into its outstanding rural setting.\n\n8)  Self Build \nKevin McCloud checks out a housing scheme in Birmingham. It's near impossible for many people, particularly those on a low income, to buy their own home. However, a Birmingham Housing Association along with Angela and Peter has set up a scheme that allows people to build one instead. The group of 11 men and women will build, not just their own property, but each other's homes as well. None of these budding self-builders have previous experience in the trade and have undergone extensive training to teach them the ropes.\n\n9)  Self Build Revisited \nKevin catches up with Angela, Peter and the housing association people of Birmingham\n\n10)  Jewel Box \nKevin McCloud visits a couple who are looking to build their hi-tech modern house in a quiet north London street. Sarah Jordan and Coneyl Jay have long dreamt of the perfect work and living space. Unable to find what they were looking for they decided to build their own. However the site they have found is situated in a predominately Edwardian street. While they wait to see if the council approve their plans, they employ architect Mike Tonkin to realise their vision but can their ambitious project ever become reality?\n\n11)  Derelict Barns \nKevin McCloud travels to south Devon to meet Sue Charman and Martin Whitlock, whose dream is to create a family home which feels part of the earth, using old English building techniques. They are not starting from scratch, but rebuilding two ancient run-down barns. Environmental concerns are extremely important to them, but will they manage to realise their vision of rebuilding the barns in same meticulous way they were built originally, whilst incorporating energy efficient, 21st century technology?\n\n12)  Derelict Barns Revisited \nKevin catches up with Sue Charman and Martin Whitlock in Devon whose dream of rebuilding two ancient run-down barns and to create a family home\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/148/5j5i.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img841.imageshack.us/img841/148/5j5i.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3640/czd4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3640/czd4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/4861/dvpx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/4861/dvpx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3262/odn0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3262/odn0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7042/tqk7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7042/tqk7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/7825/vpmp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/7825/vpmp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9048/cb36.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/9048/cb36.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/7884/zwhs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/7884/zwhs.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/301/p7un.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/301/p7un.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;337e525a5d737f001d03&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1948 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.500 (3:2)\n * Video: Resolution: 720 x 480\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 50mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 12\n * Part Size: 679 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84cd43f901d217b290629f7740ec9a4ae2728438","amp;dn":"Ch4+Grand+Designs+Collection+2+06of12+The+Cruciform+House+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84cd43f901d217b290629f7740ec9a4ae2728438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,205,67,249,1,210,23,178,144,98,159,119,64,236,154,74,226,114,132,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
