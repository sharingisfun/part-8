It is set in the middle \nof the 12th century, primarily during the time sometimes called \nthe Anarchy, between the time of the sinking of the White Ship \nand the murder of Thomas Becket. The book traces the development \nof Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque \narchitecture and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory against \nthe backdrop of actual historical events of the time.\n\nBefore this novel was published, Follett was known for writing \nin the thriller genre. The Pillars of the Earth became his \nbest-selling work. The book was listed at no. 33 on the BBC's \nBig Read, a 2003 survey with the goal of finding the &quot;nation's \nbest-loved book.&quot; The book was also selected for Oprah's Book \nClub in 2007. A sequel, entitled World Without End, was \nreleased in October 2007.\n\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly:\n\nTom Builder's dream is to build a cathedral, but in the meantime, he must \nscrounge about to find a lord that will hire him. His search pulls him and \nhis family into the politics of 12th-century England, as different lords \nvie to gain control of the throne in the wake of the recently deceased \nking. Prior Phillip, a man raised in the monastery since childhood, also \nfinds himself drafted into the brewing storm as he must protect the \ninterests of a declining church.\n\n\nFrom Ken-Follett.com\n\n...He then surprised readers by radically changing course with The Pillars \nof the Earth, a novel about building a cathedral in the Middle Ages. \nPublished in September 1989 to rave reviews, it was on the New York Times \nbestseller list for eighteen weeks. It also reached the No. 1 position on \nlists in Canada, Greatand Italy, and was on the German bestseller \nlist for six years.\n\nIt was voted the third greatest book ever written by 250,000 viewers of \nthe German television station ZDF in 2004, beaten only by The Lord of the \nRings and the Bible. When The Times of London asked its readers to vote \nfor the 60 greatest novels of the last 60 years, The Pillars of the Earth \nwas placed at No.2, after To Kill a Mockingbird [see my torrents for that\ngreat book -FB]. (The sequel, World Without End, was No.23 on the same \nlist.) In November 2007 'Pillars' became the most popular ever choice of \nthe Oprah Winfrey Book Club, returning to No.1 on the New York Times \nbestseller list. \n\nIn a time of civil war, famine and religious strife, there rises a \nmagnificent Cathedral in Kingsbridge. Against this backdrop, lives entwine: \nTom, the master builder, Aliena, the noblewoman, Philip, the prior of \nKingsbridge, Jack, the artist in stone and Ellen, the woman from the forest \nwho casts a curse. At once, this is a sensuous and enduring love story and \nan epic that shines with the fierce spirit of a passionate age.\n\n\nThe Pillars of the Earth mini-series (TV/Cable):\nIan McShane, Rufus Sewell, Matthew Macfadyen, Eddie Redmayne, Hayley Atwell \nand Donald Sutherland headline the star-studded cast for the eight-hour \nmini-series of The Pillars of the Earth, which premiered in the United States \nand Canada on Friday 23 July, 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918e81c980348da45da88943a2dc47dfa04ee506","amp;dn":"THE+PILLARS+OF+THE+EARTH+-+Ken+Follett.+John+Lee+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918e81c980348da45da88943a2dc47dfa04ee506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,142,129,201,128,52,141,164,93,168,137,67,162,220,71,223,160,78,229,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
