Today, they are a brand name for cheese in Ireland, Europe, and the United States. Their distinctively branded crackers and biscuits are available at more than seventy retailers, such as Dean &amp; DeLuca, Murrayâ€™s, and Zingermanâ€™s. Together, they are a veritable cheese master class: absolutely everything you could possibly want to know about not only the great cheeses of the world but also the fascinating little handcrafted cheeses, those individual masterworks that showcase some cheese makerâ€™s genius, and also the specialty cheeses you may not think of first but may find that you enjoy far more than some of the bigger names.\r\n\r\nSheridansâ€™ Guide to Cheese is a complete guide to cheese for both novice cheese lovers and mature connoisseurs alike. Thereâ€™s not much Kevin and Seamus have to say on the subject that isnâ€™t worth hearingâ€”or readingâ€”and this compendium is an indispensable handbook on cheese. Inside youâ€™ll find a country-by-country and style-by-style guide to cheeses of the world and heaps of practical advice on selecting, buying, aging, and storing cheese, as well as tasting notes to help you appreciate every kind you try. This is also an invaluable resource for assembling an ideal cheese plate, wine- and flavor-pairing notes, and even, here and there, a few useful recipes (such as a simply perfect risotto, which Seamus was taught in Italy by a parmesan maker).\r\n\r\nSkyhorse Publishing, along with our Good Books and Arcade imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of cookbooks, including books on juicing, grilling, baking, frying, home brewing and winemaking, slow cookers, and cast iron cooking. Weâ€™ve been successful with books on gluten-free cooking, vegetarian and vegan cooking, paleo, raw foods, and more.

While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638997c8a92bcb87b0ff0b827a14fd0105dc8493","amp;dn":"Sheridan%27s+Guide+to+Cheese+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638997c8a92bcb87b0ff0b827a14fd0105dc8493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,137,151,200,169,43,203,135,176,255,11,130,122,20,253,1,5,220,132,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
