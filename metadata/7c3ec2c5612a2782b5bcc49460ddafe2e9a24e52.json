In fact, every frame of footage has been lovingly restored from the vaults of Peter Capaldi's fertile imagination.\n\n The show will take viewers from the early silent movie experiments of Arthur Sim, through the 1930s comedies of Florrie Fontaine and the glory years of the &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; movies, to the 1970s exploitation horror movies starring Lionel Crisp, and the ultimate folie de grandeur of Terry Gilliam's Professor Hypochondria's Magical Odyssey which finally destroyed the studios in the early 1980s.\n\n Peter Capaldi says: &quot;It's weathered many a storm but the British film industry is, thankfully, still afloat. However, more than a few souls have been thrown overboard along the way and I'm therefore delighted that BBC Four has allowed me to explore the lives of some of these now forgotten icons of British cinema. Finally, the role of Cricklewood Studios and its greats will be recognised. It's a privilege to be able to shine the spotlight on them once more.&quot;\n\n \n \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cricklewood_greats/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/cricklewood_greats/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nThe Cricklewood Greats\n \n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : The Cricklewood Greats.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 500 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 43mn 36s\nTotal bitrate               : 1 603 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 43mn 36s\nBitrate                     : 1 404 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.187\nStream size                 : 438 MB (88%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 43mn 36s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 59.9 MB (12%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave preload          : 504 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3ec2c5612a2782b5bcc49460ddafe2e9a24e52","amp;dn":"The+Cricklewood+Greats+-+Comedy+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3ec2c5612a2782b5bcc49460ddafe2e9a24e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,62,194,197,97,42,39,130,181,188,196,148,96,221,175,226,233,162,78,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
