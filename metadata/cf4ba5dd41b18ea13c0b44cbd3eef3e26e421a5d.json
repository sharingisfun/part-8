Prompted to leave this activity and enter another trade, \nLeach self-incorporates as a company called ICF - a front for the young \nentrepreneur's drug-dealing activities. Soon, Carlton's business flourishes \nfirst with cocaine, then with ecstasy and heroin (as time rolls forward \nfrom the self-serving 80s into the 1990s), but with it comes severe \naddiction and, disturbingly, wave after wave of nerve-wracking violence. \nMore hardened, more severe criminals turn up to do business with Carlton's \nassociates, forcing Carlton to recruit tougher and more psychopathic \nelements to protect himself - particularly when the goods from a heroin \nshipment disappear and Turkish thugs begin closing in.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Ricci Harnett.\n=&gt;-Terry Stone.\n=&gt;-Craig Fairbrass.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Julian Gilbey.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Crime : Adventure.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2007.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.69 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 783 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 15mn.\n=&gt;-Rise of the Footsoldier....: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rise-of-the-footsoldier/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 666 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 228 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4ba5dd41b18ea13c0b44cbd3eef3e26e421a5d","amp;dn":"Rise+Of+The+Footsoldier+-+Limited+Extreme+Extended+Edition+2007+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4ba5dd41b18ea13c0b44cbd3eef3e26e421a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,75,165,221,65,177,142,161,60,11,68,203,211,238,243,226,110,66,26,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
