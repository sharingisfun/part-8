Richard Conte plays Nick Garcos, an American GI who returns from WWII to find that his father Yanko (Morris Carnovsky), a produce trucker, has lost the use of both legs because of a fight with crooked truck driver Mike Figlia (Lee J. Cobb). Nick is a clean-cut guy who was set on marrying his sweetheart Polly Faber (Barbara Lawrence). Instead, Nick gets embroiled in his father's feud with Mike, buying a truck and falling deeper into racketeering. He delivers a truckload of apples to Mike as part of a scheme to expose his cheating. A prostitute, Rica (Valentina Cortesa), tells Nick that Mike has his own plot to trap him. Nick and Rica help Mike's henchmen learn that Mike has also been cheating them, and Nick eventually gets his revenge. But Nick has permanently lost Polly because of his involvement with the gangsters and his change in personality from a good guy to a more sinister businessman. Director Jules Dassin was blacklisted from Hollywood for supposed communist sympathies after making this 1949 picture, but he went on to have success with more caper movies while in exile in France. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Thieves Highway (1949).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 662 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 1 522 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.207\n      Stream size : 1.00 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 57.1 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 38.5 MiB (3%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 322 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 16.5 --abr 64\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 62.0 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 64.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 41.8 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 297 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 16.5 --abr 64\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041958/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041958/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDual English audio (film and commentary); English subpack, French, Spanish and Portuguese srt.\n\nCredits to unclemeat, at Karagarga\n\nJules Dassin - Thieves' Highway (1949)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4abcc86c0c8a87c05048eaf4bc76799cbb7360","amp;dn":"Jules+Dassin+-+Thieves%5C%27+Highway+%281949%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4abcc86c0c8a87c05048eaf4bc76799cbb7360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,74,188,200,108,12,138,135,192,80,72,234,244,188,118,121,156,187,115,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
