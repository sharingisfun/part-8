Jesus is Jewish. He always was and He always will be. He never Ã¢â‚¬Å“convertedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to anything. But it almost seems as though this fact is something to be spoken of in whispers. How could GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son be one of them? How could the very founder of Christianity, that great, Ã¢â‚¬Å“non-JewishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ religion, get away with being Jewish?\n\nAbout the author:\n Zola Levitt was a Jewish Christian who shared the gospel &quot;through Jewish eyes.&quot; He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a German Reform Jewish family. Zola accepted Yeshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ) as his Messiah in 1971. He had held music degrees from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and completed doctoral course work Indiana University. He later received an honorary Th.D. from Faith Bible College in Dallas, Texas. Zola loved music and played the oboe, English horn, recorder and piano","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78773cad8289f0e574ad3f9bb087853dd52a701","amp;dn":"Jesus%3A+The+Jew%27s+Jew+-+Zola+Levitt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78773cad8289f0e574ad3f9bb087853dd52a701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,135,115,202,216,40,159,14,87,74,211,249,187,8,120,83,221,82,167,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
