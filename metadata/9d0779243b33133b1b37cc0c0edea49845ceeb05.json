Called the &quot;Godmother of Punk&quot;, her work was a fusion of rock and poetry. Smith's most widely known song is &quot;Because the Night&quot;, which was co-written with Bruce Springsteen and reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1978. In 2005, Patti Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2007, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On November 17, 2010, she won the National Book Award for her memoir Just Kids. She is also a recipient of the 2011 Polar Music Prize.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\n\nCountry: USA (New York)\nGenre: Rock / Protopunk / punk rock / art punk\nQuality: 320 kbps\nAlbum List:\n\n(1975) Patti Smith - Horses\n(1976) Patti Smith - Radio Ethiopia\n(1978) Patti Smith - Easter\n(1979) Patti Smith - Wave\n(1988) Patti Smith - Dream Of Life\n(1996) Patti Smith - Gone Again\n(1997) Patti Smith - Peace And Noise\n(2000) Patti Smith - Gung Ho\n(2002) Patti Smith - Land\n(2004) Patti Smith - Trampin'\n(2007) Patti Smith - Twelve\n(2012) Patti Smith - Banga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d0779243b33133b1b37cc0c0edea49845ceeb05","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+Studio+Albums%5B1975+-2012%2C+12+studio+albums+%40+320+kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d0779243b33133b1b37cc0c0edea49845ceeb05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,7,121,36,59,51,19,59,27,55,204,12,14,222,164,152,69,206,235,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
