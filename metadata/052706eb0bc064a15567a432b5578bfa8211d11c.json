His nineteenth studio album, it has been called &quot;risky&quot; but successful. The album was Bowie's &quot;highly anticipated&quot; reunion with Brian Eno, whom Bowie had worked with most famously on his Berlin Trilogy. Subtitled &quot;the Ritual Art-Murder of Baby Grace Blue: A non-linear Gothic Drama Hyper-Cycle,&quot; Outside centres around the characters of a dystopian world on the eve of the 21st century. The album put Bowie back into the mainstream scene of rock music with its singles &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot;, &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;, and &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; (notably remixed by Pet Shop Boys).\n\n\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nQuality: FLAC+.cue (lossless)\n\nTracklist:\n1 Leon Takes Us Outside 1:25\n2 Outside 4:04\n3 The Hearts Filthy Lesson 4:57\n4 A Small Plot of Land 6:34\n5 Segue - Baby Grace (A Horrid Cassette) 1:39\n6 Hallo Spaceboy 5:14\n7 The Motel 6:50\n8 I Have Not Been to Oxford Town 3:49\n9 No Control 4:33\n10 Segue - Algeria Touchshriek 2:03\n11 The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (As Beauty) 4:21\n12 Segue - Ramona A.
