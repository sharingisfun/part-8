This Advanced Edition features PDF versions of:\n\n* The Player's Handbook\n* The Judge's Handbook\n\nThat is all you need to play the game along with some friends, paper, pencils and d100 (2 ten sided dice rolled simultaneously to get a number from 001-100).\n\n\nAdditional materials in PDF form include:\n* The Ultimate Powers Book (more powers and refinements for your heroes and villains)\n* Weapons Locker (more equipment, vehicles, weapons,etc.)\n* Realms of Magic volumes 1-3 (a comprehensive magic system to add to game play)\n* Aliens - vs - Predators ( a sourcebook for including both popular sci-fi monsters into the game system)\n\n\nBut wait, there's more!!!\n\nI also included:\n* .gif templates to be colored in to bring your characters to life\n* Many handy references pulled from the books and pasted onto .doc pages for easy use\n* Custom made Character Sheet blank (in .doc format)\n* Premade Characters (On filled in Character Sheets and colored in Templates) of my own creation\n* My own magic cult to use as villains (supported by Realms of Magic sourcebooks)\n* My own rendering of Anne Rice style vampires into game terms with powers and rules plus many vampire characters (on completed character sheets and templates)\n\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is the easiest, fastest RPG system to learn and run. It is fun and fast once initial character setup is complete. Provides hours of fun, skillful play and ease of use. The best of the classic role playing games as it is simpler than Dungeons and Dragons, yet retains a full and satisfying approach to characters, adventure and game play dynamics...\n\n\nI hope you enjoy the game and the custom extras I provided.\n\n\nSeeding help and feedback (comments, quality ratings) would be wonderful.\n\n\nThanx,\nCrowed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faoDMAaDc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faoDMAaDc&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4adda38e16bfebf3504114b0844d3a66345dafc5","amp;dn":"TSR+Marvel+Superheroes+RPG+complete+%2B+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4adda38e16bfebf3504114b0844d3a66345dafc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,221,163,142,22,191,235,243,80,65,20,176,132,77,58,102,52,93,175,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
