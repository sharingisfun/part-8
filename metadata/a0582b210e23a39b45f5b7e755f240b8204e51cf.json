Das et al. (Wiley, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nIntroduction to nanofluids--their properties, synthesis, characterization, and applications\r\n\r\nNanofluids are attracting a great deal of interest with their enormous potential to provide enhanced performance properties, particularly with respect to heat transfer. In response, this text takes you on a complete journey into the science and technology of nanofluids. The authors cover both the chemical and physical methods for synthesizing nanofluids, explaining the techniques for creating a stable suspension of nanoparticles. You get an overview of the existing models and experimental techniques used in studying nanofluids, alongside discussions of the challenges and problems associated with some of these models.\r\n\r\nNext, the authors set forth and explain the heat transfer applications of nanofluids, including microelectronics, fuel cells, and hybrid-powered engines. You also get an introduction to possible future applications in large-scale cooling and biomedicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0582b210e23a39b45f5b7e755f240b8204e51cf","amp;dn":"Nanofluids+Science+and+Technology+-+Sarit+K.+Das+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0582b210e23a39b45f5b7e755f240b8204e51cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,88,43,33,14,35,163,155,69,245,183,231,85,242,64,184,32,78,81,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
