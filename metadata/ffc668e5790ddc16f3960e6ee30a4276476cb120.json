GP, released in 1973, and Grievous Angel, released posthumously in 1974, are the only two studio albums on which Parsons served as the lone bandleader. With the help of Elvis Presley's backing band and a then unknown singer named Emmylou Harris on harmony vocals, Parsons wrapped up bluegrass, honky tonk, traditional country, R&amp;B, and rock &amp; roll in one delicious package.\n\n- - -\n\nGram Parsons - GP, Grievous Angel 1973-1974\n(Warner 1990)\n\n 1.
