Online, location-based databases now help users to connect with like-minded people seeking romance, but sometimes, this facility has a dark and dangerous side. This film explores all elements of how the digital world has integrated itself into modern dating, to get to the heart of a phenomenon that has taken the UK by storm.\nThanks to dating apps and websites, those looking for love (or something a little less U-rated) have an ever-expanding number of potential suitors at their fingertips.\nBut this doc offers a warning: never has &quot;quality over quantity&quot; been more appropriate. As the daters here attest, using an app like Tinder - which finds other users nearby - often means withstanding a barrage of explicit, barely legible pick-up lines, especially for women. Anyone who doesn't open a conversation with &quot;U r hot&quot; is practically marriage material in comparison.\nFor those with niche interests (ever heard of &quot;puppy play&quot;?) apps can be an efficient way to meet like-minded people, and there is apparent success for a couple of serial ditherers. But the picture is generally rather bleak: &quot;You're only as good as your worst Tinder picture,&quot; says one battle-hardened dater.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c189a8a6a9818df5eff0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3175 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 47mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.03 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc009db82617638c1e352fc9824581669e7d6a31","amp;dn":"The.Secret.World.Of.Tinder.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc009db82617638c1e352fc9824581669e7d6a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,0,157,184,38,23,99,140,30,53,47,201,130,69,129,102,158,125,106,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
