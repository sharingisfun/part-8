A 6'1&quot; red-haired Dane, Storm spent his teens with a biker gang or in jail. But after converting to Islam he embarked on a transformation that led from a militant madrassa in Yemen to a close friendship with Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who would emerge as al-Qaeda's greatest threat to the West.\n\n\nThen Storm's story took another dramatic twist. He lost his faith and was recruited by the CIA, MI6 and MI5, becoming a double agent. His ultimate mission: to bring down his mentor al-Awlaki.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:764367a71363194e1ad181f554baccb6e56abe46","amp;dn":"Agent+Storm%3A+My+Life+Inside+al-Qaeda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"764367a71363194e1ad181f554baccb6e56abe46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,67,103,167,19,99,25,78,26,209,129,245,84,186,204,182,229,106,190,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
