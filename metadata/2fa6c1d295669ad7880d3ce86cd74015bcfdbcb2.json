She is also part woman, part swan. Jack Walser, an American journalist, is on a quest to discover Fevvers's true identity: Is she part swan or all fake? Dazzled by his love for Fevvers, and desperate for the scoop of a lifetime, Walser joins the circus on its tour. The journey takes himÃ¢â‚¬â€and the readerÃ¢â‚¬â€on an intoxicating trip through turn-of-the-century London, St. Petersburg, and SiberiaÃ¢â‚¬â€a tour so magical that only Angela Carter could have created it.
