Through\ninterviews with current members - some recently returned from prison\nothers still awaiting trial - as well as writers, academics and major\nplayers in various 'raids', the film traces the collective's breathtaking\nevolution from merry pranksters to a full-blown global movement, one armed\nwith new weapons of civil disobedience for an online world.\n\nIn recent years, Anonymous has been associated with attacks or 'raids'\non hundreds of targets. Angered by issues as diverse as copyright abuse\nand police brutality, they have also taken on targets such as the Church\nof Scientology.\n\nSeries Editor - Nick Fraser\nDirector - Brian Knappenberger\n\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 546 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 311 Kbps\nDuration 58mn 15s\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 200 Kbps / 1 200 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.167\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource me.lol\n\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 160 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 02nd of March 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c08d4863723cdcfa0e25c0b0adf299b109e511","amp;dn":"BBC+-+How+Hackers+Changed+the+World++We+Are...Legion+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c08d4863723cdcfa0e25c0b0adf299b109e511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,192,141,72,99,114,60,220,250,14,37,192,176,173,242,153,177,9,229,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
