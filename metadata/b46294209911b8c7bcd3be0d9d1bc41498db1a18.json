This book rejects dominant views that needy groups readily gain help from selfless nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Instead, they face a Darwinian struggle for scarce resources where support goes to the savviest, not the neediest. Examining Mexico's Zapatista rebels and Nigeria's Ogoni ethnic group, the book draws critical conclusions about social movements, NGOs, and &quot;global civil society.&quot;\n\n\nBiography\nClifford Bob is an author and professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He studies and teaches about human rights, activism, foreign policy, and globalization. In an earlier incarnation, he worked as a lawyer at a New York City law firm. Today, he enjoys traveling, international cooking, and biking - preferably with his lovely wife, Joan, and grown children, Alex and Natalie.\n\nHis latest book, The Global Right Wing, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2012. An earlier book, The Marketing of Rebellion, won several awards and was featured on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition with Scott Simon. \n\nPaperback: 256 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (June 6, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521607868\nISBN-13: 978-0521607865\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Rebellion-Insurgents-International-Contentious/dp/0521607868/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372876709&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Marketing+of+Rebellion%3A+Insurgents%2C+Media%2C+and+International+Activism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Rebellion-Insurgents-International-Contentious/dp/0521607868/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372876709&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Marketing+of+Rebellion%3A+Insurgents%2C+Media%2C+and+International+Activism&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b46294209911b8c7bcd3be0d9d1bc41498db1a18","amp;dn":"The+Marketing+of+Rebellion%3A+Insurgents%2C+Media%2C+and+International","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b46294209911b8c7bcd3be0d9d1bc41498db1a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,98,148,32,153,17,184,199,188,211,190,13,157,27,196,20,152,219,26,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
