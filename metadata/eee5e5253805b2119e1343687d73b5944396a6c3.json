Most of these are my rips, the oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that are not is Switch (2005), Original Sin (2010), All Juiced up (1994), Dekadance (1983) and Max Q Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Way of the World Single (1989) so thank you to the original uploaders. Live Baby Live ripped using CDex due to EAC having issues with the disc. Inxs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Underneath The Colours taken from the 2 CD Remastered Compilation Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stay Young The Deluxe YearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This is the only studio album to be remastered within this torrent. Audiochecker folder included for rips that are not mine but as before with some of my other torrents some albums report Errors and/or MPEG rips but rest assured these are authentic flacs. Audiochecker is prone to false positives and there are some with this particular torrent. If anybody has anymore Inxs, especially some more of the rare stuff (I'm thinking of the other Dekadance EP), please do make available in Lossless!\n\n\nKit \n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nINXS (pronounced &quot;in excess&quot;) is an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney.[1][2] Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax.[3] For twenty years, they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose &quot;sultry good looks&quot; and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band.[1][3] Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style,[1] including funk and dance elements. INXS achieved international success with a series of hit recordings through the 1980s and 1990s, including the albums Listen Like Thieves, Kick, X and Welcome to Wherever You Are and the singles &quot;Original Sin&quot;, &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;, &quot;Devil Inside&quot; and &quot;New Sensation&quot;.[4][5][6][7] Hutchence died in 1997 and INXS did not perform publicly for a year,[1]. The band made appearances with several guest singers including Jimmy Barnes, Terence Trent D'Arby, and Jon Stevens; Stevens formally joined the band for a tour and recording session in 2002.[2] In 2005, members of INXS participated in a reality television series, broadcast worldwide, culminating in the selection of their new lead singer, Canadian J. D. Fortune, and the release of &quot;Pretty Vegas&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot; as singles, and its album Switch.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee5e5253805b2119e1343687d73b5944396a6c3","amp;dn":"Inxs+-+Discography+Rare+and+Solo+1980+-+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee5e5253805b2119e1343687d73b5944396a6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,229,229,37,56,5,178,17,158,19,67,104,125,115,181,148,67,150,166,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
