The Moss Hart-Myles Connolly  screenplay largely disregards the facts concerning Denmark's great storyteller, opting for a fanciful blend of comedy, fantasy, romance and music. As played by Kaye, Hans Christian Andersen starts out as a small-town cobbler whose gift for spinning fairy tales is keeping the local kids from attending school. Asked to leave town, Hans heads to Copenhagen to seek his fortune as a writer. After having his heart broken by the beautiful ballerina Doro (Jeanmaire), Hans finds solace--and happiness--in the knowledge that hundreds of thousands of children the world over are devoted to his enchanting fantasy stories. The lilting Frank Loesser  score includes such tunes as &quot;No Two People,&quot; &quot;The King's New Clothes,&quot; &quot;Wonderful Copenhagen,&quot; &quot;Inchworm,&quot; &quot;The Ugly Duckling,&quot; &quot;Thumbelina,&quot; and the title song. Though Hans Christian Andersen  was a smashing box-office success, and as a bonus earned five Oscar nominations. Originally released at 112 minutes, the film is generally available in its 104-minute TV-release form. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044685/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044685/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-9815&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-9815&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:47:43\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x528 1.36:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1860 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d01950e9a113cbbf4c260daca95add68d99510","amp;dn":"Hans+Christian+Andersen+%281952%29+Danny+Kaye+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d01950e9a113cbbf4c260daca95add68d99510","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,208,25,80,233,161,19,203,191,76,38,13,172,169,90,221,104,217,149,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
