So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories.\n\nBut TrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human natureÃ¢â‚¬â€and of herselfÃ¢â‚¬â€while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love.\nGenre: Fiction, Young Adult\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2fd0441304f208739d5f3f1e627ecf3c30c54a","amp;dn":"%5BMegafileupload%5DAllegiant+-+Veronica+Roth.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2fd0441304f208739d5f3f1e627ecf3c30c54a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,47,208,68,19,4,242,8,115,157,95,63,30,98,126,207,60,48,197,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
