Studying the predictable things people do as they age is the ultimate tool for understanding trends. For instance, Dent can tell a client exactly when people will spend the most on potato chips. And he can explain why our economy has risen and fallen with the peak spending of generations, and why we now face a growing demographic cliff with the accelerating retirement of the Baby Boomers around the world.\nDent predicted the impact of the Boomers hitting their highest growth in spending in the 1990s, when most economists saw the United States declining. And he anticipated the decline of Japan in the 1990s, when economists were proclaiming it would overtake the U.S. economy.\nBut now, Dent argues, the fundamental demographics have turned against the United States and will hit more countries ahead. Inflation rises when a larger than usual block of younger people enter the workforce, and it wanes when large numbers of older people retire, downsize their homes, and cut their spending. The mass retirement of the Boomers won't just hold back inflation; it and massive debt deleveraging will actually cause deflationÃ¢â‚¬â€weakening the economy the most from 2014 into 2019.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e752c3d74a461f38ca41bdc65e1b79ca81a292db","amp;dn":"The+Demographic+Cliff+by+Harry+S.+Dent+Jr.+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e752c3d74a461f38ca41bdc65e1b79ca81a292db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,82,195,215,74,70,31,56,202,65,189,198,94,27,121,202,129,162,146,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
