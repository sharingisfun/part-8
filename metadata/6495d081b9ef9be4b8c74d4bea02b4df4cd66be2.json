From the White House under siege by the homeless to a 190-year-old woman perpetually near death and dimly glowing, each tale unfolds the illogical extremes of humanity in the late twentieth century. Highsmith transmogrifies the face of daily existence to lay bare its manifold dark motives. These stories leave us haunted with Ã¢â‚¬Å“afterimages that will trembleÃ¢â‚¬â€but stayÃ¢â‚¬â€in our mindsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The New Yorker).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6495d081b9ef9be4b8c74d4bea02b4df4cd66be2","amp;dn":"Tales+of+Natural+and+Unnatural+Catastrophes+-+Patricia+Highsmith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6495d081b9ef9be4b8c74d4bea02b4df4cd66be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,149,208,129,185,239,155,228,184,199,77,75,234,2,180,223,76,214,107,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
