The material here is strong enough to stand out on its own merits, though. This album should be especially interesting to Angra fans because of obvious similarities to the Angra debut. In fact, Matos reportedly left Viper when the band wanted to go in a different direction, while Matos pushed to continue the stylish neo-classical/power/progressive sound of this album. He did just that after finding the rest of Angra members.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685489bc2f57c40ae132c6138dd9deb104222919","amp;dn":"Viper+-+Theatre+of+Fate+-+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685489bc2f57c40ae132c6138dd9deb104222919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,84,137,188,47,87,196,10,225,50,198,19,141,217,222,177,4,34,41,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
