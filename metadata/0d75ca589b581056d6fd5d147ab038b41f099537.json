Avi won the competitionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s award for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best Rhythm Section,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the first year that this award had ever included a vocal bass (the award was called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best Vocal PercussionistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ before AviÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victory prompted the language change).  In his third year at Mt. San Antonio, Avi joined Sincopation, an award-winning jazz ensemble that won the Monterey Jazz Festival Competition in his first year. He has performed at venues worldwide, including New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.\n\nKEVIN Ã¢â‚¬Å“K.O.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ OLUSOLA\nKevin grew up in the small town of Owensboro, Kentucky, the son of a Nigerian psychiatrist and a Grenadian nurse.
