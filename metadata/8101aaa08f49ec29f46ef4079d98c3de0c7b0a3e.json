After all, Grosse Pointe Blank and Romy &amp; Michele&amp;#039;s High School Reunion, two other &amp;#039;80s-themed films with predominantly new wave soundtracks, spun off two hit albums apiece, and none of those four albums sold as well as The Wedding Singer. If you overlook the fact that Wedding Singer 2 is a cash-in, just like any other soundtrack sequel, you may find that the album is quite an enjoyable new wave compilation. Of course, there are a number of familiar items here, including &quot;Too Shy,&quot; &quot;Private Idaho,&quot; and &quot;Money,&quot; plus &quot;True&quot; and &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record),&quot; two items showcased in the film itself, so their absence from the first album was puzzling. Nevertheless, what makes this fun is the appearance of songs that usually don&amp;#039;t make new wave comps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ not only is Depeche Mode&amp;#039;s &quot;Just Can&amp;#039;t Get Enough&quot; here (it provided the title for Rhino&amp;#039;s exhaustive new wave series, but never appeared on any of the 15 discs), but so is the forgotten Flock of Seagulls&amp;#039; tune &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot; and Madonna&amp;#039;s &quot;Holiday,&quot; which rarely appears on comps. Also, it&amp;#039;s nice to hear the Cars&amp;#039; &quot;It&amp;#039;s All I Can Do&quot; instead of &quot;My Best Friend&amp;#039;s Girl,&quot; and it&amp;#039;s cool to have the J. Geils Band&amp;#039;s &quot;Love Stinks&quot; and Hall &amp; Oates&amp;#039; timeless &quot;You Make My Dreams&quot; thrown into the mix. It&amp;#039;s all entertaining enough to make Adam Sandler&amp;#039;s album closer &quot;Grow Old with You&quot; tolerable for those who don&amp;#039;t git wit his style of humor.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Too Shy - Kajagoogoo [3:39]\n02 - It&amp;#039;s All I Can Do - The Cars [3:43]\n03 - True - Spandau Ballet [5:34]\n04 - Space Age Love Song - A Flock of Seagulls [3:45]\n05 - Private Idaho - The B-52&amp;#039;s [4:04]\n06 - Money (That&amp;#039;s What I Want) - The Flying Lizards [2:31]\n07 - You Spin Me &amp;#039;Round (Like a Record) - Dead or Alive [4:27]\n08 - Just Can&amp;#039;t Get Enough - Depeche Mode [3:35]\n09 - Love Stinks - J.
