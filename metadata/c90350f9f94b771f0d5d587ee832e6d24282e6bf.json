Anyone who has had personal information taken because of a hacked email account can understand the need for cryptography and the importance of encryptionÃ¢â‚¬â€essentially the need to code information to keep it safe. This detailed volume examines the logic and science behind various ciphers, their real world uses, how codes can be broken, and the use of technology in this oft-overlooked field\n\n\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c90350f9f94b771f0d5d587ee832e6d24282e6bf","amp;dn":"Cryptography-+Cracking+Codes+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c90350f9f94b771f0d5d587ee832e6d24282e6bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,3,80,249,249,75,119,31,13,93,88,126,232,50,230,210,66,130,230,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
