It may be religion, education or, as here in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWaiting for HappinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, cultural differences. It has often been pointed out, that Iranic cinema deals with self reflection: This also is true for this particular branch of African cinema, as Sissako himself points out: &quot;Creation is a search of oneself... And not only creation, but also all that one does.&quot;\n\nOn the edge of the desert lies a small coastal town. While it is as rural as can be, its location allows it to serve as a transit town, for those traveling to Europe. Here, Abdallah is visiting his mother become traveling to Europe. Unfamiliar with local costume and the dialect, he is a stranger in a strange land, that it self is estranged, as it on one side maintains local costumes and on the other side tries to allow progress to enter. We are constantly introduced to elements, which doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to fit in: red sneakers, television, karaoke and even something as simple as a childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s toy, while at the same time being shown how tradition is taught from elders to the young.\n\nThroughout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWaiting for HappinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Sissako sets up situations where people have to talk to each other. It is curious, that in a film almost empty of dialogue, the act of communication is one of the central themes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe intention to communicate is more important than communication itself. If somebody wants to speak to me, it means I exist in their eyes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Sissako.\n\nSissako made ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWaiting for HappinessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ without any script and with non actors, having taken characters already existing and put into the location, also already existing. As he says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt is all there for the camera to captureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. For Sissako it is important that it is the images that tell the story, that with almost poetic simplicity examinants the conflict between western progress and native (Islamic) tradition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with a healthy portion of self irony and humour.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Heremakono.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,462,075,392 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:31:28\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x384 (AR: 1.667)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1930 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.314 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308363/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308363/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench and Hassanya audio; English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by crasus, whom we thank\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0107949b85fd8bc32b01d9e366156e63d92e8ddb","amp;dn":"Abderrahmane+Sissako+-+Heremakono+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0107949b85fd8bc32b01d9e366156e63d92e8ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,7,148,155,133,253,139,195,43,1,217,227,102,21,110,99,217,46,141,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
