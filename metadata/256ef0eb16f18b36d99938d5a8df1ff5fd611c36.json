He claims that he and the FBI have the same interests: bringing down dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will co-operate, but insists that he will speak only to Elizabeth Keen, a rookie FBI profiler. Keen questions Reddington's sudden interest in her, though he claims that Keen is very special. After the FBI brings down a terrorist he provided information on, Reddington reveals that the terrorist is only just the first of many. In the last two decades, he's made a list of criminals and terrorists he believes the FBI cannot find because they did not know they exist and that they matter the most. Reddington calls it &quot;The Blacklist&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256ef0eb16f18b36d99938d5a8df1ff5fd611c36","amp;dn":"The.Blacklist.S01E05.HDTV.XviD-FUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256ef0eb16f18b36d99938d5a8df1ff5fd611c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,110,240,235,22,241,139,54,217,153,56,213,168,223,31,245,253,97,28,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
