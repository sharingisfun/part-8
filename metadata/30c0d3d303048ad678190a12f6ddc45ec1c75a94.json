Yet instead of being showered with respect, drummers are often viewed with derisionÃ¢â‚¬â€stereotyped as crazy, borderline psychotic, or just plain dumb. But as every musician knows, to have a great band you need a great drummer: Ginger Baker. John Bonham. Chad Smith. Stewart Copeland. Lars Ulrich. Neil Peart.\n\nFor the first time, journalist Tony Barrell shines a long overdue spotlight on these musicians, offering an exciting look into their world, their art, and their personalities. In Born to Drum, Barrell explores the extraordinary history of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most primitive instrument and the musicians who have made it legend. He interviews some of the most famous and revered and well-known drummers of our timeÃ¢â‚¬â€including Chad Smith, Ginger Baker, Clem Burke, Sheila E, Phil Collins, Nick Mason, Patty Schemel, Butch Vig, and Omar HakimÃ¢â‚¬â€who share astonishing truths about their work and lives. He investigates the stories of late, great drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, analyzes many of the greatest drum tracks ever recorded, and introduces us to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest drummer, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loudest drummer, and the first musician to pilot a Ã¢â‚¬Å“flying drum kitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on stage.\n\nFascinating and filled with little known details, Born to Drum elevates drummers and their achievements to their rightful place in the culture of the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30c0d3d303048ad678190a12f6ddc45ec1c75a94","amp;dn":"T%2CBarrell%2C+Born+to+Drum%2CTruth+About+the+Worlds+Greatest+Drummers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30c0d3d303048ad678190a12f6ddc45ec1c75a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,192,211,211,3,4,138,214,120,25,10,18,246,221,196,94,193,199,90,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
