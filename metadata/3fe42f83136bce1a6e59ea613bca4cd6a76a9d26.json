The band consists of singer/guitarist Glen Phillips, guitarist Todd Nichols, bassist Dean Dinning, and drummer Randy Guss. The band enjoyed chart success in the 1990s with the singles &quot;Walk on the Ocean,&quot; &quot;All I Want,&quot; &quot;Something's Always Wrong,&quot; and &quot;Fall Down,&quot; among others. The band officially broke up in 1998 to pursue other projects and have not released a new studio album since 1997, but continue to tour the United States as a band in small-venue, short-run tours.\n\n\n\nEarly career\n\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket was formed in 1986 at San Marcos High School just outside of Santa Barbara, California, when singer/songwriter Glen Phillips was only 16; the other members were 17 and juniors. The band originally contained another junior, Adam Olis, who was kicked out of the band before any major success. The band drew its name from the Eric Idle monologue &quot;Rock Notes&quot; on Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album from 1980, although the name is featured in a parody of The Old Grey Whistle Test on Rutland Weekend Television in 1975. The band's first public appearance was at an open-mic talent contest in September 1986. The band lost the competition.\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket's first album was released in 1989. Bread &amp; Circus was self-financed through their label, Abe Records. The album spawned the singles &quot;Way Away&quot; and &quot;One Little Girl&quot;, which made the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, but received little attention.\n\nThe follow-up to Bread &amp; Circus, Pale, was released in 1990 and saw their sound mature. During the recording of the album, Toad signed to Columbia Records while declining the opportunity to re-record Pale, but negotiating to have Columbia Records reissue Bread &amp; Circus.[1] Featuring the singles &quot;Jam&quot; and the Modern Rock Chart hit &quot;Come Back Down&quot;, the album was still not a success; but the singles received heavy airplay on college radio stations and the band's first music video (for &quot;One Little Girl&quot;) was directed by Mark Miremont and aired on MTV's 120 Minutes.\n\n\nCommercial breakthrough\n\n\n\nThe band finally achieved fame with their third album, Fear. The album was released in 1991, and saw the singles &quot;All I Want&quot; and &quot;Walk on the Ocean&quot; reach the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100. The album became the band's first RIAA-certified platinum album.\n\nIn 1992, the cult classic Buffy the Vampire Slayer featured the song &quot;Little Heaven&quot; and was included in the movie soundtrack.\n\nIn 1993, the Mike Myers feature film So I Married an Axe Murderer included the song &quot;Brother&quot; on its soundtrack. &quot;Brother&quot; later appeared on the In Light Syrup compilation album, as well as on the 2004 release of the live album Welcome Home: Live at the Arlington Theatre, Santa Barbara 1992.\n\nIn 1994, after years of heavy touring, the band released Dulcinea, their follow-up to Fear. This album spawned the hit singles &quot;Fall Down&quot;, which reached #1 on the US Modern Rock charts, as well as #5 on the Mainstream Rock chart, and &quot;Something's Always Wrong&quot;, which also charted. Like Fear, this album was certified platinum by the RIAA.\n\nA compilation album of b-sides and rarities, In Light Syrup, was released in 1995; it included the singles &quot;Good Intentions&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack for the television show Friends, as well as the aforementioned &quot;Brother&quot;. The compilation was certified as a gold album in 2001.\n\nThe release of Coil in 1997 acted as the proper follow up to 1994's Dulcinea. Featuring a more electric, rock sound, it featured the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock hit &quot;Come Down&quot;, as well as the singles &quot;Crazy Life&quot; (previously featured on the soundtrack for the film Empire Records) and &quot;Whatever I Fear&quot;, which did not chart. The album, despite the success of &quot;Come Down&quot; as a single, failed to reach any sales benchmarks. This failure is often attributed to the label doing a poor job of promoting the album.[citation needed]\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket formally broke up in July 1998, citing creative differences.\n\n\n\nToad since the breakup\n\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket, though officially broken up since 1998, has worked together off and on over the years. They performed on several occasions in 1999, although only short sets. Also in 1999, they recorded two studio tracks for a compilation release, P.S. A Toad Retrospective, including one of the first songs they wrote together as a band, &quot;P.S.&quot;.\n\nThe band temporarily reunited in late 2002, playing a benefit for the Rape Crisis Center in Santa Barbara, and opening a few shows for Counting Crows. The group then played a few months of full-length shows in early 2003. Although seemingly successful, at the end of the tour the band decided to continue on their separate paths and careers.\n\nIn 2004, Toad released an album of a live show that was put to tape in 1992. This album, Welcome Home: Live at The Arlington Theatre, Santa Barbara 1992, showcased the height of their popularity during the tour for Fear.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, the band reunited for a 34-date nationwide tour of the United States.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007 they played several shows with lead singer Glen Phillips serving as their opening act.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, the band reunited once again to play two shows - one in St. Petersburg Florida then the next night at the House of Blues Orlando prior to joining The Rock Boat VIII.\n\nOn January 25, 2008, the band played a set at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nOn June 11 &amp; 12, 2008, they played in Philadelphia and New Jersey at the Trocadero and Starland Ballroom respectively.\n\nOn June 14, 2008, they played at the 27th Annual Alexandria Red Cross Waterfront Festival.[2]\n\nOn June 15, 2008, the band performed at The Norva in Norfolk, VA. One of the show's highlights was the band performing Glen Phillip's solo hit &quot;Everything But You&quot;.\n\nOn December 19, 2008, the band performed on The Adam Carolla show at the Canyon Club in Agoura Hills, CA.\n\nIn May 2009 they played a four show mini-tour including two nights at the intimate 400 seat venue The Ark in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and also in an outdoor venue at Neptunes Park in Virginia Beach, VA. The Virginia Beach show was very successful and the patrons were very appreciative of a very good playlist and good showing.\n\nContinuing throughout the 2009 summer, the group played a second 12-stop mini tour which started with a show at the House of Blues in Houston, TX. During the show, the band noted that it had been some time since they had played a venue in Texas. However, noting the positive crowd response and energetic atmosphere, Philips stated that the group &quot;would try to make it an annual stopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the future.[3]\n\n\n\nGlen Phillips' solo career\n\n\nImmediately after the July breakup in 1998, Glen Phillips began his own solo career. He has toured almost constantly up to the present time, usually just him and his guitar, but often with regular guest musicians. He has a close friendship with the members of Nickel Creek, and they often perform together; they recorded a studio album called Mutual Admiration Society in 2000, released in 2004. In addition to that collaboration, Glen has released three solo studio albums, Abulum (2000), Winter Pays For Summer (2005) and Mr. Lemons (2006), along with a live album, Live At Largo (2003).\n\nAlso, in spring 2006, Glen released a studio EP titled Unlucky 7, featuring outtakes from his &quot;Winter Pays For Summer&quot; studio sessions (and one track, &quot;The Innocent&quot;, from his scrapped 2002 &quot;Tornillo&quot; album). In February 2008, Glen released another EP entitled &quot;Secrets of the New Explorers&quot; consisting of six songs inspired by private space travel. In March 2008, Glen and Works Progress Administration, which includes Sean and Sara Watkins of Nickel Creek, finished mixing a self-titled album that was released on August 28, 2009. Also on tap for this prolific songwriter is an album with Garrison Starr and Nielson Hubbard to be released under the band name Plover. Glen is also mixing another EP to be released in 2009 before starting work on his next full length record for a 2010 release.\n\n\n\nLapdog\n\n\nTodd, Dean and Randy have also continued in music. In the late 1990s, Todd and Dean formed a new band called Lapdog. They recorded and released the studio album Near Tonight (2001), and toured minimally. After this, Dean quit the band to split his time between recording and producing local music and pursuing his acting career, and Randy joined Lapdog as their drummer. Again Lapdog recorded and released an album, called Mayfly (2002). Since then Lapdog has kept a fairly low profile, though they still occasionally perform publicly.\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket released five studio albums, two live EPs, a rarities compilation, a posthumous live album and a hits compilation for Columbia Records. The band was also featured on a number of soundtracks and uncatalogued singles and tapes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBread &amp; Circus 1989\n\n\nBread &amp; Circus is an album by Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1989. It is the band's debut album, recorded while the four were still in high school for a total bill of $650.\n\nIn May of 2009, the band announced plans to re-release &quot;Bread And Circus&quot;, out of print since 2001, in a remastered 20th Anniversary edition with expanded artwork and bonus tracks culled from the album sessions that didn't make it onto the album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Way Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n2.\t&quot;Scenes From a Vinyl Recliner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n3.\t&quot;Unquiet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:54\n4.\t&quot;Know Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n5.\t&quot;When We Recovered&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n6.\t&quot;One Wind Blows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n7.\t&quot;Pale Blue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n8.\t&quot;Always Changing Probably&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n9.\t&quot;One Little Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n10.\t&quot;Covered in Roses&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPale 1990 \n\n\nPale is the second album by Toad the Wet Sprocket. Recorded independently in 1989 for roughly $6000, the band negotiated a deal with Columbia Records to release this without any alterations, along with their 1988 release &quot;Bread And Circus&quot;, &quot;Pale&quot; was released in January 1990 and &quot;Come Back Down&quot; was serviced to radio as the leadoff single.\n\nThe album has a slower, darker, more dirge-like quality than the band's debut.\n\nIn May 2009, the band announced plans to re-release &quot;Pale&quot;, out of print since 2001, in a remastered 20th Anniversary edition with expanded artwork and bonus tracks culled from the album sessions that didn't make it onto the album. Their debut, &quot;Bread And Circus&quot; will also get the same anniversary re-issue.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Torn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n2.\t&quot;Come Back Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n3.\t&quot;Don't Go Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n4.\t&quot;High On The Riverbed&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n5.\t&quot;I Think About&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23\n6.\t&quot;Corporal Brown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n7.\t&quot;Jam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n8.\t&quot;Chile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n9.\t&quot;Liars Everywhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n10.\t&quot;Nothing Is Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n11.\t&quot;She Cried&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFear 1991\n\n\nFear is an album by Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1991. The album was preceded by the single &quot;Is It For Me&quot;, which failed to chart well.\n\nIts best known single, the second commercial release &quot;All I Want&quot;, which reached #15 on the Billboard Hot 100, helped launch their career. On November 6, 1992, Fear was certified gold and on September 1, 1994, it was certified platinum\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Walk on the Ocean&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n2.\t&quot;Is It For Me?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n3.\t&quot;Butterflies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n4.\t&quot;Nightingale Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:03\n5.\t&quot;Hold Her Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n6.\t&quot;Pray Your Gods&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03\n7.\t&quot;Before You Were Born&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n8.\t&quot;Something to Say&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n9.\t&quot;In My Ear&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n10.\t&quot;All I Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n11.\t&quot;Stories I Tell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n12.\t&quot;I Will Not Take These Things for Granted&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Live 1992\n\n\nFive Live is a live EP by alternative rock band Toad the Wet Sprocket. The EP was a limited pressing of 5,000 copies bundled with the first pressing of the album fear. Recorded at the Whisky A Go-Go in 1992, it contains 4 live songs from their prior albums as well as a live version of &quot;Hold Her Down&quot; which is from the fear album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Jam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n2.\t&quot;One Little Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19\n3.\t&quot;Scenes From a Vinyl Recliner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n4.\t&quot;Come Back Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n5.\t&quot;Hold Her Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDulcinea 1994\n\n\nDulcinea is an album by Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1994. It is their fourth studio album with Columbia Records and the follow-up to their popular album fear, which was released in 1991. Two songs from Dulcinea reached Top 40 designation on the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts: &quot;Fall Down&quot; and &quot;Something's Always Wrong&quot;. Dulcinea was RIAA Certified Gold on September 1, 1994 and Platinum on July 31, 1995.[1]\n\nThe album's name is a reference to the love interest in Miguel de Cervantes' classic Spanish novel, Don Quixote. At least two songs on the album allude to themes found in the novel. &quot;Crowing&quot; is a song about a man who does not know how to keep a hold of his lover. &quot;Windmills&quot; is a metaphorical song about how people spend much of their lives chasing absurd or impossible pursuits (the allusion being to a specific scene in Don Quixote where the title character uselessly attacks a windmill).\n\nDulcinea also delves into some spiritual themes. &quot;Fly from Heaven&quot; is sung from the perspective of James, who is portrayed as Jesus' literal brother and upset about the manipulation of His word. &quot;Begin&quot; and &quot;Reincarnation Song&quot; each explore questions about death and the afterlife.\n\nFrom a musical perspective, Dulcinea is a return by Toad to the basics of a four-person band. The band leaves behind the overdubbed and orchestral aspects of Fear for a cleaner acoustic sound (possibly with the exception of &quot;Fall Down&quot;).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Fly from Heaven&quot; (Glen Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n2.\t&quot;Woodburning&quot; (Todd Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n3.\t&quot;Something's Always Wrong&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:59\n4.\t&quot;Stupid&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n5.\t&quot;Crowing&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n6.\t&quot;Listen&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n7.\t&quot;Windmills&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n8.\t&quot;Nanci&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n9.\t&quot;Fall Down&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24\n10.\t&quot;Inside&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n11.\t&quot;Begin&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n12.\t&quot;Reincarnation Song&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Light Syrup 1995\n\n\nIn Light Syrup is an album of B-sides and rare tracks by Toad the Wet Sprocket, released in 1995. In Light Syrup was RIAA Certified Gold on June 4, 2001.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Brother&quot; (Glen Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n2.\t&quot;Little Heaven&quot; (Todd Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n3.\t&quot;Good Intentions&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n4.\t&quot;Hobbit On The Rocks&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n5.\t&quot;Are We Afraid&quot; (Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n6.\t&quot;So Alive&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n7.\t&quot;All In All&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n8.\t&quot;All Right&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:46\n9.\t&quot;Janitor&quot; (Toad the Wet Sprocket) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n10.\t&quot;Chicken&quot; (Toad) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n11.\t&quot;Hope&quot; (Nichols, Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n12.\t&quot;All She Said&quot; (Toad) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoil 1997\n\n\nCoil is an album by Toad the Wet Sprocket released in 1997. It is their fifth studio album, and the final one before the band broke up in 1998. As with previous albums, Coil was released under the Columbia Records label and produced by Gavin MacKillop.\n\nThis album has been praised by some as the band's most mature album. It combines themes explored in all of their previous albums - including love, spirituality and the virtues of an uncomplicated life - and it continues the straightforward acoustic sound found in Dulcinea. One song from the album hit the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock Charts, &quot;Come Down,&quot; and the single &quot;Crazy Life&quot; explores the perceived injustices experienced by Leonard Peltier.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Whatever I Fear&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n2.\t&quot;Come Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n3.\t&quot;Rings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n4.\t&quot;Dam Would Break&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n5.\t&quot;Desire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n6.\t&quot;Don't Fade&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n7.\t&quot;Little Man Big Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n8.\t&quot;Throw It All Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n9.\t&quot;Amnesia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n10.\t&quot;Little Buddha&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n11.\t&quot;Crazy Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n12.\t&quot;All Things In Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fe42f83136bce1a6e59ea613bca4cd6a76a9d26","amp;dn":"Toad+the+Wet+Sprocket+-+Discography+1988+-+1997+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fe42f83136bce1a6e59ea613bca4cd6a76a9d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,228,47,131,19,107,206,26,110,89,234,97,59,202,76,214,167,106,157,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
