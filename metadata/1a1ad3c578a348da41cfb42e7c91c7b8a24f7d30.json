Been away for a while, I hope to get you by times some things I like the way I think they should be ... etc.\n\tAnyway, here is the new version of Scott Adams' God's Debris and The Religion War; I made a combination of two books that should go together, and it is here for the other upload just is ... not up to it, so I took some effort to do it right.\n\t \n\tPersonally I think it is for the first part a load of bull, but I just got annoyed with the upload of the second part.\n\tMistakes? Errors? Do it better yourselves, and reload.\n\tWhat you get is a .pdf and a .pdb, it's been read and most mistakes are out. Do not hesitate to improve.\n \n\tEnjoy.\n\n\tRabitinque\n\n\tFiles:\n\tRar;\n\tContents:\n\tAdams Scott - God's Debris - Religion War.pdb\n\tAdams Scott - God's Debris - Religion War.pdf\n\n\tSeed.
