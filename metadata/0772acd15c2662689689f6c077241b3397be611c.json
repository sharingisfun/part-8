Our hero Captain J.B. Coldyron, police robotics genius and ranch owner, whose dialogue was all dubbed by a different actor and written by a different species? The goofy office robot who somehow possesses more sophisticated intelligence than the dangerous Ã¢â‚¬Å“advancedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ prototype on the loose, aka R.O.T.O.R.? Or what the acronym R.O.T.O.R. itself stands for: Robotic Officer of the Tactical Operations Research. Yes, the last word in the killer police robotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name is Research, for some reason. Except later in the movie, when it suddenly stands for Reserve instead. Why? If you want an explanation, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better ask Shoeboogie, the wacky Native American janitor who loves to dance. Actually, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask Shoeboogie anything, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably best to avoid all eye contact with Shoeboogie.\n\nColdyron! Research! Shoeboogie! If you say those words real fast they kind of sound like a song, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also three of the many reasons you should join Mike, Kevin, and Bill for the wonder of wonders that is R.O.T.O.R.!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0772acd15c2662689689f6c077241b3397be611c","amp;dn":"Rifftrax+-+R.O.T.O.R.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0772acd15c2662689689f6c077241b3397be611c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,114,172,209,92,38,98,104,150,137,246,192,119,36,27,51,151,190,97,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
