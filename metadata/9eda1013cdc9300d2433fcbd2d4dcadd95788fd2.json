As an ex magicianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assistant, trained contemporary dancer, St MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alumna with an MA in theatre direction, a performer in burlesque show and dance club, and an actress, Paloma has been mixing artistic media throughout her adult life. A few years ago she introduced music into the equation, at first mimicking the blues and soul singers she admired, but eventually finding her own voice.\n\nDo You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful? is the debut album by English singer Paloma Faith.
