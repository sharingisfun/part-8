Drawing on years of experience, Meyers explains how to write software that is more effective: more efficient, more robust, more consistent, more portable, and more reusable. In short, how to write C++ software thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just plain better.\n\nMore Effective C++ includes:\n\n- Proven methods for improving program efficiency, including incisive examinations of the time/space costs of C++ language features\n- Comprehensive descriptions of advanced techniques used by C++ experts, including placement new, virtual constructors, smart pointers, reference counting, proxy classes, and double-dispatching\n- Examples of the profound impact of exception handling on the structure and behavior of C++ classes and functions\n- Practical treatments of new language features, including bool, mutable, explicit, namespaces, member templates, the Standard Template Library, and more. If your compilers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet support these features, Meyers shows you how to get the job done without them.\n\n\nMore Effective C++ is filled with pragmatic, down-to-earth advice youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use every day. Like Effective C++ before it, More Effective C++ is essential reading for anyone working with C++.\n\nTable of Contents\n- Basics\n- Operators\n- Exceptions\n- Efficiency\n- Techniques\n- Recommended Reading\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 336 pages\nPublisher: Addison-Wesley Professional (December 1995)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 020163371X\nISBN-13: 978-0201633719\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da640c214d1f8143965135f58e9181c51e18add2","amp;dn":"More+Effective+C%2B%2B+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da640c214d1f8143965135f58e9181c51e18add2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,100,12,33,77,31,129,67,150,81,53,245,142,145,129,197,30,24,173,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
