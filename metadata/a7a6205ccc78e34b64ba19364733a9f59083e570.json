Fujio is beautiful, talented, well-heeled, and engaged to Munechika, a rising young diplomat. She has promised him a gold watch, a family heirloom, as an emblem of their engagement. But she falls in love with Ono, a student employed to tutor her in English, who is attracted by her beauty and wealth. Ono is himself bound by an engagement to Sayoko, the daughter of his mentor, Professor Inoue. The self-centered Fujio is ready to forsake everything for Ono, but he is prevailed upon to go ahead with his marriage to Sayoko. Fujio then offers the watch to Munechika who, perceiving FujioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true feelings, hurls the watch into the sea.\n\nRip Specs (DVD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : Gubijinso.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 460 Kbps\nLength            : 1.17 GiB for 1h 8mn 11s 40ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 999 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 1 channel, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : ja\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : fr\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026444/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026444/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, French\n\nMy rip\n\nGubijinsÃƒÂ´ AKA Poppy (Kenji Mizoguchi, 1935)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a6205ccc78e34b64ba19364733a9f59083e570","amp;dn":"Gubijins%26ocirc%3B+AKA+Poppy+%28Kenji+Mizoguchi%2C+1935%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a6205ccc78e34b64ba19364733a9f59083e570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,166,32,92,204,120,227,75,100,186,25,54,71,51,169,245,144,131,229,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
