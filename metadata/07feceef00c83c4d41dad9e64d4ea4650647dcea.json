Both are now adults; many of life's great discoveries have been made, its vagaries and losses have been suffered. Through it all, the women's friendship has remained the gravitational center of their lives. Both women once fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew upâ€”a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received novels. In this final book, she has returned to Naples. Lila, on the other hand, never succeeded in freeing herself from the city of her birth. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity to the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Nearness to the world she has always rejected only brings her role as its unacknowledged leader into relief. For Lila is unstoppable, unmanageable, and unforgettable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07feceef00c83c4d41dad9e64d4ea4650647dcea","amp;dn":"Elena+Ferrante-The+Story+of+the+Lost+Child","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07feceef00c83c4d41dad9e64d4ea4650647dcea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,254,206,239,0,200,60,77,65,218,217,230,77,78,164,101,6,71,220,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
