OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Conner and Stewart Kellerman explode the misconceptions that have led generations of language lovers astray. They reveal why some of grammarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-known Ã¢â‚¬Å“rulesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€œand never wereÃ¢â‚¬â€œrules at all. They explain how Brits and Yanks wound up speaking the same language so differently, and why British English isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily purer. This playfully witty yet rigorously researched book sets the record straight about bogus word origins, politically correct fictions, phony franÃƒÂ§ais, fake acronyms, and more. English is an endlessly entertaining, ever-changing language, and yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blooper could be tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bon motÃ¢â‚¬â€œor vice versa! Here are some shockers: Ã¢â‚¬Å“TheyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was once commonly used for both singular and plural, much the way Ã¢â‚¬Å“youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is today. And an eighteenth-century female grammarian, of all people, is largely responsible for the all-purpose Ã¢â‚¬Å“he.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The authors take us wherever myths lurk, from the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s English to street slang, from Miss GrundyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s admonitions to four-letter unmentionables. This eye-opening romp will be the toast of grammarphiles and the salvation of grammarphobes. Take our word for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be903af30cffa7e68ed146481c96e898310f570d","amp;dn":"Origins+of+the+Specious%3A+Myths+of+the+English+Language+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be903af30cffa7e68ed146481c96e898310f570d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,144,58,243,12,255,167,230,142,209,70,72,28,150,232,152,49,15,87,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
