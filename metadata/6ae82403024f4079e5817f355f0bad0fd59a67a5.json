His first career-retrospective album, and fourth official greatest-hits album overall, it was released in the United Kingdom, and in other countries such as Japan and Australia, but not in the United States.  The album spans his second album Elton John in 1970 to the successful then most-recent 1989 album Sleeping with the Past. After the huge hit that was the double A-sided &quot;Sacrifice&quot;/&quot;Healing Hands&quot; single, which was the third best-selling single of 1990 in the United Kingdom, the album became an instant smash in that country. It spent its first two weeks at #1 and then nine strong weeks at #2. It was kept from the top during all nine weeks by Madonna's Immaculate Collection. In all the album spent 145 weeks inside the UK top 200 album chart, making a total of 11 re-entries, and it was certified 9Ãƒâ€” Platinum by the BPI on 1 March 1995.  It includes a total of 28 hit singles plus the new songs &quot;Easier to Walk Away&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Love Someone&quot;, which also made the charts between 1990 and 1991.\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Your Song\n[02] Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time)\n[03] Honky Cat\n[04] Crocodile Rock\n[05] Daniel\n[06] Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\n[07] Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\n[08] Candle In The Wind\n[09] Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\n[10] Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\n[11] Philadelphia Freedom\n[12] Someone Saved My Life Tonight\n[13] Pinball Wizard\n[14] The Bitch Is Back\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:07m:18s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Don't Go Breaking My Heart - - - Elton John &amp; Kiki Dee\n[02] Bennie And The Jets\n[03] Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\n[04] Song For Guy\n[05] Part-Time Love\n[06] Blue Eyes\n[07] I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\n[08] I'm Still Standing\n[09] Kiss The Bride\n[10] Sad Songs (Say So Much)\n[11] Passengers\n[12] Nikita\n[13] I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That\n[14] Sacrifice\n[15] Easier To Walk Away\n[16] You Gotta Love Someone\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:10m:41s\n\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:17m:59s\nTotal File Size....................... 847mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
