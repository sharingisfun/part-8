Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. Forty years later more than 80% of Americans still believe there was a conspiracy to kill the President and that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. Peter Jennings Reporting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy attempts to separate fact from conspiracy theories to get to the truth.\n\nBeyond Conspiracy employs stunning forensic technology that makes it possible for the first time to be an eyewitness to this crime of the century Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to see precisely what happened that November day in Dallas. Award-winning animator Dale Myers spent the last decade creating a computer-generated reconstruction of the assassination based on maps, blueprints, physical measurements, over 500 photographs, the Zapruder film and crime-lab and autopsy reports. His work was independently evaluated and given the highest marks by the foremost practitioners of this type of forensic analysis. Myers reconstruction brings viewers as close as anyone could come to actually being in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963.\n\nBeyond Conspiracy producers conducted extensive interviews with more than 70 friends and family of both Oswald and his killer, Jack Ruby; former officials from the CIA, FBI, Russian KGB, and the Dallas Police; members of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations; and participants in the various official investigations, including the Warren Commission. The program makes use of many of the more than four million documents relating to the assassination that have been released in just the last few years.\n\nBeyond Conspiracy is a program that counters speculation and theory with rational conclusions based on hard evidence as it examines a tragedy that still haunts the American psyche.\n\n \nThe Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy first aired November 20, 2003 on ABC.\n\nUPLOADERS NOTE - If you are one of the folks who think Oswald did NOT act alone, watch this. Check out the CGI. You may have your mind changed. There was no conspiracy, just one dumb lone nut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6979b718307f7de210cfdeb8a1e5e952ce4fb099","amp;dn":"The+Kennedy+Assassination+-+Beyond+Conspiracy+%5B2004%5D+ABC+News","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6979b718307f7de210cfdeb8a1e5e952ce4fb099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,121,183,24,48,127,125,226,16,207,222,184,161,229,233,82,206,79,176,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
