Scott has been introduced to the rave scene, and Ecstasy, by Craig. The two of them go out on the weekends, with some of CraigÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s friends, and stay up all night, dancing in a drug-fueled trance. Occasionally, they bring Heather and Sam along for the ride. While some Dad's might fancy a trip to the park or to a game, scott prefers the drug soaked night life for his precious little ones.\n\nHeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s also aware of his role as a protector. One lengthy sequence documents a party at which Sam and Heather want to take Ecstasy for the first time. Scott is there, and is already ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½rollingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ himself, and thinks maybe tonight is good night for Sam to try it also. Sam is only 13, and clearly giving your teen son drugs is A-OK with Scott. He gives them the money, and he even guides them through the experience, saying things like &quot;feel good, Sam?&quot; While his 13 year old son pupils rool around in his head and he can barely open his eyes. Parenting at it's finest.\n\nThank God, ScottÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s ex-wife doesn't seem to think this is a good idea. When she reads one of her daughterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s letters and finds out about the drug use, she calls the sheriff, and Scott is arrested for drug possession. The filmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s second half revolves around his legal problems, the extremely limited, supervised custody heÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s grudgingly granted, and the tear-stained faces of his children, who want to see him as much as he wants to see them. Or maybe they just want to do more drugs with pop, who knows. Regardless, it makes for one of the most fascinating and controversial documentaries out there.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337719/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337719/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------\n\nThis cautionary program pulls no punches as it tracks the downward spiral of a successful suburban husband and father who, at 40, becomes addicted to the drug ecstasy and ruins his family and his marriage. A powerfully unsettling firsthand account of middle-class drug abuse, the program documents Scott's dive into the rave scene, where he encourages his teenage children to do drugs with him; his acrimonious divorce and custody battle; his arrest on drug charges; and his children's fruitless attempt to help him get straight. The emotional devastation and brain damage resulting from drug abuse are emphasized. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5dcd8dceb5d8dc252914d46378c60e3d4265bba","amp;dn":"Small+Town+Ecstasy+-+HBO+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5dcd8dceb5d8dc252914d46378c60e3d4265bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,220,216,220,235,93,141,194,82,145,77,70,55,140,96,227,212,38,91,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
