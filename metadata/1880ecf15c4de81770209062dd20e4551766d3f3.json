Taylor, formerly of alt-country rock group The Court &amp; Spark. 'Bad Debt' is his debut solo outing, a showcase for his comforting vocals which have been compared to the likes of Towns Van Zandt, John Martyn and Neil Young. As that implies, Taylor's voice has the qualities required to spin out a captivating yarn in the folk, blues, country or even gospel modes, imbued with a classic sensibility which gives his deeply lyrical meditations on sin, sacrifice and redemption the gravity to really affect the soul.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1880ecf15c4de81770209062dd20e4551766d3f3","amp;dn":"Hiss+Golden+Messenger...Bad+Debt%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1880ecf15c4de81770209062dd20e4551766d3f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,128,236,241,92,77,232,23,112,32,144,98,221,32,228,85,23,102,211,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
