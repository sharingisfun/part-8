No subs. Source is unknown to me (not an original DVD), I got it from a shady internet store in America on DVDR. Sound is MPGEG-1, so probably a VHS or AVI rip. I also have Mondo trasho and will probably upload it after this one. My upload is very slow, so it&amp;#039;ll probably take a while!\n\nI&amp;#039;m still looking for Serial mom, Pecker, The Diane Linkletter story, Eat your makeup, Roman candles and Hag in a black leather jacket.
