Heinlein\nPages: 149 A4\nAwards: 1967 Hugo Award, Best Novel (Win)\nSci-FI\n\nIn 2075, underground colonies are scattered across the Moon (Luna). Most &quot;Loonies&quot;, as the residents are called, are either criminals, political exiles or their descendants. Anyone who stays longer than a few months undergoes &quot;irreversible physiological changes and can never again live in comfort and health in a gravitational field six times greater than that to which their bodies have become adjusted.&quot; Thus, transportees, having served their sentences, have no choice but to remain. The total population is about three million, with men outnumbering women two to one, down from ten to one in the early days. This has a profound effect on society. For example, polyandrous forms of marriage are the norm.\n\nAlthough the Earth-appointed Protector of the Lunar Colonies (universally called the Warden and just as universally reviled) holds power, in practice there is little intervention in the loose Lunar society. There is work enough for anyone who wants it.\n\nHOLMES IV (High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV) is the Lunar Authority's master computer. It has gradually been given almost total control of Luna's facilities as a cost-saving measure; it is cheaper (though not as safe) to have a single main computer and expand its capacity than to have multiple independent systems.[3]\nDjvu2 reader &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ds6.ovh.org/djvu2-reader-read-djvu.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ds6.ovh.org/djvu2-reader-read-djvu.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df62efff0c5084bb61cfbcbfff07f35238f52333","amp;dn":"Heinlein%2C+Robert+Anson+-+The+Moon+Is+A+Harsh+Mistress+%5Bsci-fi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df62efff0c5084bb61cfbcbfff07f35238f52333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,98,239,255,12,80,132,187,97,207,188,191,255,7,243,82,56,245,35,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
