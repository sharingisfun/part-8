Robert Pois and Philip LangerÃ¢â‚¬â€one a historian, the other an educational psychologistÃ¢â‚¬â€study seven cases of military command failures, from Frederick the Great at Kunersdorf to HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invasion of Russia. While the authors recognize the value of psychological theorizing, they do not believe that one method can cover all the individuals, battles, or campaigns under examination. Instead, they judiciously take a number of psycho-historical approaches in hope of shedding light on the behaviors of commanders during war. The other battles and commanders studied here are Napoleon in Russia, George B. McClellanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Peninsular Campaign, Robert E. Lee and PickettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Charge at Gettysburg, John Bell Hood at the Battle of Franklin, Douglas Haig and the British command during World War I, &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris and the Strategic Bombing of Germany, and Stalingrad.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f180996bc8d9ace9b9c90e93043c7439a80d3a","amp;dn":"Command+Failure+in+War%3A+Psychology+and+Leadership","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f180996bc8d9ace9b9c90e93043c7439a80d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,241,128,153,107,200,217,172,233,185,201,14,147,4,60,116,57,168,13,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
