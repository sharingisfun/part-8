Unfortunately providing the JP               \n  skit voices was not enough to undo this.\n  \n  Figuring out what they changed took a lot of analysis, made extra\n  annoying due to a large amount of localization changes compiled\n  into the game ... something like looking for a particular needle\n  in a haystack full of needles.\n  \n  Fortunately, I got fresh motivation every time I saw one of those\n  mute skits; now you can thank me each time you hear one. ;)\n  \n  Event, skit, battle and movie voices are now Japanese.  Yes, the\n  few movies lack subtitles; live with it.  The temporarily missing\n  voice bug in 1.01 is also fixed.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Consider multi-language or special-edition releases with the\n  original high quality Japanese voices.\n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125f1b208a81c581ad39a60267efe88652c83f50","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Abyss+USA+UNDUB+2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125f1b208a81c581ad39a60267efe88652c83f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,95,27,32,138,129,197,129,173,57,166,2,103,239,232,134,82,200,63,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
