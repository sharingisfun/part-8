Orthopedic Emergencies focuses on the acute management and stabilization of orthopedic injuries with specific recommendations on procedures and the stabilization of fractures and dislocation. The topics are organized anatomically with additional chapters on Procedures, Reduction Techniques, and Immobilization and Splinting. The information needed for a rapid diagnosis is available instantly through the bullet-point-style text, diagrams, images, pearls and pitfalls. There are specific recommendations on which splint to apply and how to position the affected limb, as well as advice on when to arrange follow up with an orthopedist or sports medicine physician. The spiral binding allows the book to lay flat for easy use at the bedside, making Orthopedic Emergencies the ideal companion for all emergency medicine providers including emergency department physicians, sports clinics, family medicine practitioners and mid-level providers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5fb9b09a2bb1f9fa1f7a8384f1eb5b7b18f35f9","amp;dn":"Orthopedic+Emergencies%2C+Expert+Management+%28Cambridge%29+%5BEpub%5D+%5BSt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5fb9b09a2bb1f9fa1f7a8384f1eb5b7b18f35f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,251,155,9,162,187,31,159,161,247,168,56,79,30,181,183,177,143,53,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
