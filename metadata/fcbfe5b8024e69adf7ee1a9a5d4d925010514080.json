At her funeral, a film producer thinks back over the past two weeks and the part he might have played in her death. He&amp;#039;d gone to Corfu to track her down, pushing himself into her island villa, where she lived with a nurse, an old countess, and the plastic surgeon who&amp;#039;s success at keeping her looking young is amazing. We see her mental stability fail as the producer offers her a script for &quot;Anna Karenina;&quot; soon she&amp;#039;s locked away in a Parisian asylum and the producer is in the hospital with a concussion. His reverie ended, the countess takes up the narration and completes Fedora&amp;#039;s story.\n\n\n\n\tWilliam Holden\t... \tBarry &amp;#039;Dutch&amp;#039; Detweiler\n\tMarthe Keller\t... \tFedora\n\tHildegard Knef\t... \tCountess Sobryanski\n\tJosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Ferrer\t... \tDoctor Vando\n\tFrances Sternhagen\t... \tMiss Balfour\n\tMario Adorf\t... \tHotel Manager\n\n\tStephen Collins\t... \tYoung Barry\n\n\tHenry Fonda\t... \tPresident of the Academy\n\n\tMichael York\t... \tHimself\n\tHans Jaray\t... \tCount Sobryanski\n\tGottfried John\t... \tKritos\n\n\tArlene Francis\t... \tNewscaster\n\tJacques Maury\t... \tHead Usher\n\tChristine Mueller\t... \tYoung Antonia\n\tEllen Schwiers\t... \tNurse\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcbfe5b8024e69adf7ee1a9a5d4d925010514080","amp;dn":"Fedora+%281978%2C+Billy+Wilder%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcbfe5b8024e69adf7ee1a9a5d4d925010514080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,191,229,184,2,78,105,173,247,238,26,154,93,77,146,80,16,81,64,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
