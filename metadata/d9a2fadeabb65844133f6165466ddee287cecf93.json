Their stunning debut-album was a seminal blend of flamenco and progrock and paved the way to flamenco-inspired progrock in Spain, culminating in bands like AZAHAR, CAI, ALAMEDA, QUALDAQUIVIR, MEZQUITA and MEDINA AZAHARA. The story of TRIANA started in Seville, the beating heart of the flamenco. Jesus de la Rosa (keyboards/vocals) was a known musician in the local music scene and he even had international success with &quot;Los Bravos&quot; and their single &quot;Black Is Black&quot;. But he wanted to form his own band to make progressive rock, so he recruited Eduardo Rodriquez Rodway (vocals/guitar) and Juan Jose Palacios 'Tele' (drums/percussion). The trio called themselves TRIANA, named after the most traditional part of the town and they moved to Madrid. With some help they were allowed to record their music in a studio with highly advanced equipment. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a2fadeabb65844133f6165466ddee287cecf93","amp;dn":"Triana+discografia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a2fadeabb65844133f6165466ddee287cecf93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,162,250,222,171,182,88,68,19,63,97,101,70,109,222,226,135,206,207,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
