Extreme mood swings, impulsive behaviors, and suicidal tendenciesÃ¢â‚¬â€common conduct among those who suffer from the disorderÃ¢â‚¬â€leave family members feeling confused, hurt, and helpless.\n\n\nIn her pioneering first book Stop Walking on Eggshells, co-authored with Paul T. Mason, Randi Kreger outlined the fundamental differences in the way that people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) relate to the world. Now, with The Essential Family Guide to Borderline Personality Disorder, she takes readers to the next level, giving them straightforward tools to get off the emotional roller coaster and repair relationships with loved ones with BPD. Kreger answers the questions family members most want to ask about:  the symptoms and treatment of BPD, including why BPD is so misdiagnosed; how symptoms can differ by age and gender; and how addiction and other disorders complicate BPD. She then outlines how families can set boundaries and communicate differently in order to help themselves and their loved ones cope with this bewildering form of mental illness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b009bd88caf835c5adfb056d4bba32405f4201f3","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Family+Guide+to+Borderline+Personality+Disorder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b009bd88caf835c5adfb056d4bba32405f4201f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,9,189,136,202,248,53,197,173,251,5,109,75,186,50,64,95,66,1,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
