The album was executively produced by Eminem, who had recently released his hugely successful second studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, a year earlier. The album's title comes from the Devil's Night tradition, recognized in and around Detroit in which abandoned homes are set ablaze. This practice was so popular in Detroit that it was depicted in the film 8 Mile. The album produced three singles: &quot;Purple Pills&quot;, &quot;Ain't Nuttin' But Music&quot;, and &quot;Fight Music&quot;. The album featured a hidden track by Eminem called &quot;Girls&quot;, which is a diss track aimed at Limp Bizkit, DJ Lethal, and Everlast. Devil's Night was also the first album to be released on Eminem's Shady Records label, although the label has been active since 1999. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 372,000 copies sold on the week of release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32c64112c694071ce5a4398e6ce25798b064211","amp;dn":"D12+-+Devil%27s+Night+%282001%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32c64112c694071ce5a4398e6ce25798b064211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,44,100,17,44,105,64,113,206,90,67,152,230,206,37,121,139,6,66,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
