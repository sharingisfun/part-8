I Can Lift A Car\n\nMoon Rocks\nBy Eric Webb\n\nI get it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s summer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hot. You have too much time on your hands, or you want to feel like you do. Your calves have taken sweet flight from their pants prisons. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve considered accepting popsicles instead of money as payment for goods and services rendered (cream-filled, of course Ã¢â‚¬â€ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not a fool).\n\nYou probably want a summer soundtrack or something donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you? Something to pipe through the olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ earholes and pretend you know the words to whilst in the car? OK. Fine. You jackals.\n\nBe smart: Go spend your next popsicle-check on Walk the MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled album.\n\nIn a fit of coincidence (or predestination, for all you Calvinists), I heard lead single Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anna SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the radio the night before this album dropped and ShazamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d it. Then I watched the music video. Then I added it to my Ã¢â‚¬Å“JamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ playlist. Then I wept openly, for in the deepest chasm of my eÃ¢â‚¬â„¢er pining heart, I knew that civilization had achieved its zenith: an album I could listen to while I jog and not have to skip any tracks.\n\nSo. I guess itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a pretty good, then.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e0f1a809bf1abdb5df4ef4cbfd7f153b8d3e747","amp;dn":"Walk+The+Moon+-+Walk+The+Moon+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e0f1a809bf1abdb5df4ef4cbfd7f153b8d3e747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,15,26,128,155,241,171,219,93,244,239,76,191,215,241,83,184,211,231,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
