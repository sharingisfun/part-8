Here based Northern Fleet. Sailors of transport fleet, warships and aircraft were doing everything possible to convoys - a special form of transport ships and escort ships - to reach the port of destination. In the struggle for delivery to the Soviet Union of essential goods the vast Norwegian and Barents seas great battle was unfolded. Her protagonists were sailors and airmen of Soviet Northern Fleet and the allies. Delivery of goods from the U.S. and the UK took place in three main ways. The shortest and most dangerous of them was way over the north direction - from the ports of Iceland and Scotland to Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. The first Arctic convoy, received the name of &quot;Dervish&quot; came to Arkhangelsk August 31, 1941 without losses. But since the spring of 1942, the German High Command, realizing the importance of the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union, took drastic measures, focusing in Northern Norway over a hundred warships, including three battleships headed by giant &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, about 30 submarines and more than 300 bombers. To prevent the enemy from using the path along the coast of Norway, the Soviet command concentrated here 23 submarines. Preparing the boat to sail took about a month and consisted of several stages. And the sea and the crew and the boat itself lived by special laws. Soviet bombers and torpedo-bombers provided cover for the Arctic convoys, bringing great victory. Among them are many heroes of the Soviet Union.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1839/jivhq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1839/jivhq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8523/4s9x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8523/4s9x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9394/co4l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9394/co4l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2393/m8ab.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/2393/m8ab.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9059/ehsn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/9059/ehsn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1809/roz6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/1809/roz6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5374/iv2d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/5374/iv2d.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/7017/e7oa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/7017/e7oa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6025/r2uc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6025/r2uc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6360/n9qpk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/6360/n9qpk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8382/z9vz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8382/z9vz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3564/jrbt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3564/jrbt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1872/lmih.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1872/lmih.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3690/fjio.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3690/fjio.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/815/zpwj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/815/zpwj.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/2597/f1oc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/2597/f1oc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2045 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.875:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:23.400\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 705 MB / average\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Liberators:_The_Soldiers_of_the_Red_Army&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Liberators:_The_Soldiers_of_the_Red_Army&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ef557b183ac203422f7154044d687e07a36501","amp;dn":"TV+Rossiya+Liberators+The+Soldiers+of+the+Red+Army+12of12+Northe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ef557b183ac203422f7154044d687e07a36501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,239,85,123,24,58,194,3,66,47,113,84,4,77,104,126,7,163,101,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
