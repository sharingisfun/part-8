The large number of pedagogical devices employed in this text will guide a student through the course. Integrated throughout the text, students and instructors will find Explore-Discuss boxes which encourage students to think critically about mathematical concepts. In each section, the worked examples are followed by matched problems that reinforce the concept being taught. In addition, the text contains an abundance of exercises and applications that will convince students that math is useful. A MathZone site featuring algorithmic exercises, videos, and other resources accompanies the text.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 770 pages\n# Publisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 9 edition (January 19, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0077350103\n# ISBN-13: 978-0077350109\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c07db2d8aa132ce22db4e38e53e6bc21d35da38","amp;dn":"College+Algebra+with+Trigonometry+%2C9th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c07db2d8aa132ce22db4e38e53e6bc21d35da38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,7,219,45,138,161,50,206,34,219,78,56,229,62,107,194,29,53,218,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
