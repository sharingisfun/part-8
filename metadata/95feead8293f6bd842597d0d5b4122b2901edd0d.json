On the other hand, dicks are everywhere! They cut in line, talk behind our backs, recline into our seats, and even have the power to morph into trolls online. Their powers are impressive, but with a little foresight and thoughtfulness, we can take a stand against dickishness today. How Not to Be a Dick is packed with honest and straightforward advice, but it also includes playful illustrations showing two well-meaning (but not always well behaved) young people as they confront moments of potential dickishness in their everyday lives. Sometimes they falter, sometimes they triumph, but they always seek to find a better way. And with their help, you can too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95feead8293f6bd842597d0d5b4122b2901edd0d","amp;dn":"How+Not+to+Be+a+Dick%3A+An+Everyday+Etiquette+Guide+%282013%29epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95feead8293f6bd842597d0d5b4122b2901edd0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,254,234,216,41,63,107,216,66,89,125,13,91,65,34,178,144,30,221,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
