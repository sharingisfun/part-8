Formed in early 1994 while the members were teenagers, the trio's first recorded song earned them a deal with Iceland's Bad Taste label. Their sprawling debut LP, Von (Hope), was released in 1997, followed the next year by a collection of remixes from that album, Recycle Bin. Kjartan Sveinsson joined the band on keyboards and the band recorded 1999's strings-heavy Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis Byrjun (Good Start), earning themselves numerous accolades in their homeland and achieving platinum status in sales. Agust then departed and was quickly replaced by Orri PÃƒÂ¡ll DÃƒÂ½Rason.\n\n  Svefn-G-Englar, their first release to be distributed outside of their native country, was hailed as NME's Single of the Week during September of 1999, launching a press hype steamroller in the U.K. and -- to a lesser extent -- in the U.S. The &quot;NÃƒÂ½ Battery&quot; single was issued in early 2000, the band's break-out year. British independent Fat Cat began distributing the band, stretching their reach beyond Icelanders and rabid journalists. April dates in England with Godspeed You Black Emperor! were capped off by an appearance at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, and they also opened several dates of Radiohead's European tour before year's end.\n\n  Sigur RÃƒÂ³s spent the first three months of 2001 off from the road, setting up their own studio and making their third album. Meanwhile, Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis Byrjun found a label in the U.S. and world-wide press became increasingly positive and varied; both Entertainment Weekly and The Wire ran features on the band. The group began touring again in April, playing more shows in Europe, a handful in the States, and several more in Japan throughout the remainder of the year. By the end of the year, Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis Byrjun had won the Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music; it was also declared Iceland's Best Album of the Century.\n\n  ( ), Sigur RÃƒÂ³s' third album, was released in 2002. The majority of the material was honed on the road prior to being recorded at Alafoss, the group's studio, located outside Reykjavik. The album featured a raw sound in comparison to its predecessors and scaled back the extreme highs and lows that were prominent on Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis Byrjun. Three years later, they issued 2005's Takk..., featuring some tighter arrangements and brighter tones. In 2007 they released the documentary film Heima, which chronicled the band's tour of Iceland the previous year alongside an intimate acoustic show at a coffee shop in the small town of Borg.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a6943b2caf7c8c5a792b2e7206009fdef3f49f8","amp;dn":"Sigur+Ros+-+Kveikur+%282013%29+%28Japan%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a6943b2caf7c8c5a792b2e7206009fdef3f49f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,105,67,178,202,247,200,197,167,146,178,231,32,96,9,253,239,63,73,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
