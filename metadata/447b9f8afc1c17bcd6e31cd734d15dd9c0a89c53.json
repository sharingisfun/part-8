Fitzsimmons is perhaps best known for his songs &quot;Passion Play&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Go,&quot; which aired during pivotal scenes in ABC's medical drama Grey's Anatomy.[1] His first two full-length albums, Until When We Are Ghosts (2005) and Goodnight (2006) were completely self-produced and recorded by Fitzsimmons at his former home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His most recent effort, 2008's The Sparrow And The Crow was his first studio record, and impressively reached #1 on the iTunes Top Folk Albums chart, and #56 on the iTunes Top Albums chart. In addition to the above, his music has also been featured on ABC's Brothers &amp; Sisters, MTV's Life of Ryan, The CW's One Tree Hill, ABC Family's Greek, and Lifetime's Army Wives, and he has been given reference in Billboard, Rolling Stone, Paste, Spin, Musikexpress, Uncut, Q Magazine, and Performing Songwriter Magazine.\n\n\n\nDerivatives, a new collection from William Fitzsimmons, is a multicolored re-imagining of several prominent tracks from The Sparrow and the Crow, Fitzsimmons' well-received 2009 release on Mercer Street Records / Downtown Records.
