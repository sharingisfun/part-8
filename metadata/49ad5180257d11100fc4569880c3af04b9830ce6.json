What better way to celebrate than to upload some good lossless music for you fellow audio junkies out there? Black Mountain&amp;#039;s In the Future is a great rock album with influences from tons of other genre&amp;#039;s and mp3s really don&amp;#039;t do it justice. So kick back and give it a listen in FLAC.  Put it on a CD and play it on your nice home stereos.  It&amp;#039;s not worth the larger download to play this through laptop speakers, so if that&amp;#039;s your plan then save the bandwidth for someone who will really appreciate this.\n\nAlso, this is the deluxe edition of the album which came with a bonus CD and only 10,000 were produced. Here is the track list:\n\nCD 1:\n01. Stormy High    [0:04:33.53]\n02. Angels    [0:03:07.58]\n03. Tyrants    [0:08:02.50]\n04. Wucan    [0:06:02.72]\n05. Stay Free    [0:04:29.70]\n06. Queens Will Play    [0:05:16.56]\n07. Evil Ways    [0:03:26.12]\n08. Wild Wind    [0:01:42.38]\n09. Bright Lights    [0:16:41.21]\n10. Night Walks    [0:03:56.43]\n\nCD 2:\n01. Bastards of Light    [0:05:09.27]\n02. Thirteen Walls    [0:07:06.54]\n03. Black Cat    [0:02:51.28]\n\nRipped with EAC 0.99 (log files included) and checked with AccurateRip.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for future releases, leave them here in th e comments.  I am new to uploading lossless torrents so let me know if I should do something differently.\n\nI really love this band and think that everyone should support them and buy a CD if you really like it, but I want everyone to hear it, too.  Support Black Mountain and see a show if they come to your area at least.\n\nWatch for more...\n\n - slavetothesound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ad5180257d11100fc4569880c3af04b9830ce6","amp;dn":"Black+Mountain+-+In+the+Future+Deluxe+Edition+-+slavetothesound+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ad5180257d11100fc4569880c3af04b9830ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,173,81,128,37,125,17,16,15,196,86,152,128,195,175,4,185,131,12,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
