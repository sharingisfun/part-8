Ã¢â‚¬Å“This year I celebrates my half a century. If it is true that a picture can explain more than thousand words, I am what you see on the selfportrait above. The picture says I love drawing and I love the graphite (also said I have an ugly face, but you are kind and pretend not to notice) I always had overwhelming passions, and the drawing is one of them. For a long time I have left to devote to other things, but I returned three years ago. Unfortunately I did not study art, and everything I know I learned from experience and from reading some manual drawing.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e19734c0a212322f2809cf1ceccc843a85574f6","amp;dn":"Franco+Clun+ArtWorks+%28Art+Pencil+Drawings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e19734c0a212322f2809cf1ceccc843a85574f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,25,115,76,10,33,35,34,242,128,156,241,206,204,200,67,168,85,116,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
