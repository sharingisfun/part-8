She's a consummate artist, playing to her strengths while trying to subtly, but surely, extend her reach, and always following her own muse, even when it takes her into dissonant territory. Most of her albums are out of print even on CD, and sell for collector's prices when they can be found. This is too bad, because Clark has assembled a solid, if quirky, and passionately honest body of work. This best-of issued by Beehive is truly that. It features 24 tracks and clocks in at over 75 minutes. Many of these are Clark's most lovely songs, such as &quot;The Sitting Room,&quot; &quot;All Night Party&quot; (with Vini Reilly of Durutti Column), the &quot;12&quot; remix&quot; of &quot;Our Darkness,&quot; and &quot;The Last Emotion,&quot; as well as instrumental themes such as &quot;Swimming&quot; and &quot;An Ordinary Life.&quot; Simply put, without being able to collect her singles or albums, this is as good as you can do without getting ripped off in the bargain. \nAnne Clark's best-of presents a wonderfully deep portrait of a complex and misunderstood artist who deserves far more in terms of the recognition she has thus far received. \nThis is truly a beautiful collection by a great poet and composer.
