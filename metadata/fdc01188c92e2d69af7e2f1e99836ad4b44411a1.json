Upon discovering Celtic music and European symphonic metal, Leah realized she was home; these were the genres that resonated with her soul. Songwriting followed thereafter as Leah found comfort and strength in her musical self-expression. LeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hypnotizing voice has drawn comparisons to Enya, Delain, and Loreena McKennitt as she can elegantly slip between the soothingly ethereal, the grippingly powerful, and lyrical folk styles with fluid ease.\n\nHer music is equally diverse. Braiding a hypnotising fusion of celestial vocals and sparkling strings, rippling piano, galloping drums and sharp guitar work, she leads her listeners on a passionate journey through haunting sonic landscapes. Her poetic lyrics draw from the inkwells of fantasy, passion, tragedy, and folklore, telling stories that are as arrestingly beautiful as the music. It is not by mere fancy or chance that LeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music has a medieval flavor and Celtic overtones: Leah has Irish and Scottish blood in her veins and her heritage can be traced back to the ancient highlands of the British Isles. Innovating with her creative imagination, experience, and her Gaelic ancestry, Leah crafted songs that would eventually be recorded for her first album, Of Earth and Angels.\n\nOf Earth and Angels, June 2012\n\nGiven LeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streak of rugged individualism, it should be no surprise that she recorded and produced her first album under her own independent label, Ex Cathedra Records. Lyrically, the album blended earthly tales of struggle with the inspiration of angelic folklore. It also defined LeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique sound: a dichotomy of seraphic melody and symphonic metal, steeped in Celtic influences.\n\nThe road was not easy, however. As a young mother committed to raising and educating her children at home, Of Earth and Angels was two years in the making from start to finish. However, the long journey was worth it. Released in June of 2012, Of Earth and Angels was an immediate success as the reaction from both the listeners and the media was universally positive. Fueled only by word of mouth and social media, listeners became enamored with the auburn-haired singer\nand her musical vision. Though Leah did not have any major-label support to promote her album, her grass-roots popularity spread the earth like wildfire.\n\nWithin months, Leah transitioned from an untested newcomer to an internationally acclaimed artist. However, this meteoric success also plunged her into the turbulent atmosphere of the metal world. She found herself on unfamiliar terrain as her homegrown music faced professional critics, industry insiders, and the global scrutiny of symphonic metal fans who compared LeahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music to long-established artists. Yet, like gold tested by fire, Leah emerged with validated purity: Of Earth and Angels earned multiple awards, coveted placement on many Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best Of the YearÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lists, critical acclaim by reviewers, airplay by radio stations, and a\nmassive international following of devoted fans.\n\nLet All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence EP, December 2012\n\n\nNot one to close the creative spigot for too long, Leah recorded a three-track EP in time for Christmas, 2012, entitled Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence. This EP interpreted three traditional Christmas carols in symphonic metal form.\n\nOtherworld EP, Last Quarter 2013\n\nDuring the long months of 2013, Leah returned to the songwriting table and composed a new EP called Otherworld. This EP further explores the Celtic tones of Of Earth and Angels, combining ethereal vocals with a balanced mix of hypnotically peaceful melodies and galloping rockers that transports the listener to a prior era. Each song has a poignant story to tell, ranging from issues of loss, struggle, and aspiration. Otherworld also marks the first time Leah has collaborated with a guest vocalist. The legendary Eric Peterson of Testament and DragonLord provided his signature vocals on one track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dreamland.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The EP was further enriched by the talented music producer Christian Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoschusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Moos at Spacelab Studios and the famed MA. Jan Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ãƒâ€“rkkiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yrlund of Darkgrove Design, who produced the stunning album art.\n\nIn a time when the symphonic metal world is overpopulated by homogeneous newcomers and formulaic musical recipes, Leah is a fresh Irish Sea breeze of originality that captures the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention, enchants the heart and electrifies the imagination. She continues her songwriting, remains in touch with her fan base, and looks forward to musical projects in the future. Leah is not about to rest: her story has just begun!\n\n\nLeah Official Site\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Kings &amp; Queens\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Arcadia\n2. Save the World\n3. Angel Fell\n4.

SiÃƒÂºil a RÃƒÂºn (Bonus Rock Version)\n\n\nSymphonic metal artisan Leah's 2012 debut Of Earth &amp; Angles was an addictive and very cohesive collection of songs (not to mention a nominee for Symphonic Metal Album Of The Year in 2012's Metal Storm Awards). It was easy to sing along with the metal-infused rock and each track had a unique personality. Now we are treated to her sophomore album, Kings &amp; Queens, which takes a different, far more mature approach, and is a singular wave of beautiful metal music.\n\nThis album reminds me of the ocean, vast and gorgeous. Each wave is unique in size and form, and each wave washes over you in a different way. However, these swells and crests are not as important as the whole, the sometimes smooth, sometimes stormy, eternal being that is the ocean.\n\nThis is a grand symphonic opus that manages to be very heavy-hitting throughout and even very power metal at times (for example, the wondrous &quot;Enter The Highlands&quot; ). Leah enjoys a broad spectrum of world music and while known for her Celtic and new-age influence, here she incorporates middle-eastern elements more than ever in a very Cirque du Soleil-like melting pot of brilliance. Featuring Blind Guardian's live bassist Barend Courbois, and Timo Somers and Sander Zoer of Delain, the performances are of course top-notch to carry out this blooming soundscape.\n\nMy only complaint is in the mix. Instruments are beautifully balanced but Leah's sumptuous vocals are treated as if they're another of these instruments. In the past, Leah introduced us to a strong, luxurious, and versatile voice. She brought each song to life with her magic. If you're familiar with her previous work, Kings &amp; Queens may sound as if that voice is buried in the mix (hopefully new listeners will not find this an issue). It may be an aesthetic choice that does in fact yield a beautiful finished product but I can't help but wonder how much more vital these songs could have been if her opulent voice had been more prominent.\n\nIt is what it is, however, and it is still a jewel of an album. Bold colors and lovely melodies stream through tracks such as &quot;Palace Of Dreams,&quot; &quot;Alpha And Omega,&quot; and many others. Whether you loved Leah's previous music or are new to her work, your ears will dance to the fantasia laid out before us. The album is out January 30th in Europe and February 3rd in North America and worldwide via Inner Wound Recordings. Hear the track &quot;Enter The Highlands&quot; and pre-order at her Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nGenre: Others\nSubgenre: Symphonic Celtic Metal / Female Vocal\nBitrate: 320 k\nSize: 191.92 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n15 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc01188c92e2d69af7e2f1e99836ad4b44411a1","amp;dn":"Leah+-+Kings+And+Queens+%282015%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc01188c92e2d69af7e2f1e99836ad4b44411a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,192,17,136,201,46,45,105,175,126,47,30,153,131,106,212,180,68,17,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
