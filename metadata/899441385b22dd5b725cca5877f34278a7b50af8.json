It is a revised and enlarged version of\nhis 1977 book entitled &quot;Fractals : form, chance and dimension&quot;.\n====================================================================================\n\n\n\nBear with me for a moment - this file is in .djvu format. What's .djvu? I didn't know, but apparently it's a file format that is especially good at compressing black and white images - like textbooks/text. You'll have to get a .djvu viewer to view this document. Don't press the back button tho... Y'know how .pdf files get huge and bloated? And yknow how .pdf files have huge, bloated, viewers, like the adobe reader one? .djvu viewers are way faster, and better IMO. On the flipside .djvu files don't support as rich of text, but this is a scan of a book anyways.\n\n\nMy review of the book? Trippy stuff! You really can't use this book as your only source of learning material for fractals. I recommend http://classes.yale.edu/fractals/ for learning, or another book on fractals, like http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4714221/Fractal_Geometry__Mathematical_Foundations_and_Applications\n\n\nMy advice is to ignore most of the math lingo (there isn't a full explanation of some symbols or topics, they're just thrown in there, when you really need a more formal education on them to understand them). Look at the pictures, and get hyped up about order and chaos and attractors and inversions and systems and dimensions and shit! THEN look at follow up material, if you're interested in math.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899441385b22dd5b725cca5877f34278a7b50af8","amp;dn":"Benoit+Mandelbrot+-+The+Fractal+Geometry+of+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899441385b22dd5b725cca5877f34278a7b50af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,148,65,56,91,34,221,91,114,92,202,88,119,243,66,120,167,181,10,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
