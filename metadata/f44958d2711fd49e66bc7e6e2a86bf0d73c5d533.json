WeberÃƒÂ¢??s film traces the manÃƒÂ¢??s career from the 1950s, when he was in his prime, playing with jazz greats like Charlie Parker and Gerry Mulligan, to the 1980s, when he had become a skid row junkie unable to get a decent gig. By juxtaposing these two decades, Weber presents a sharp contrast between the younger, handsome Baker ÃƒÂ¢?? the statuesque idol who resembled a mix of James Dean and Jack Kerouac ÃƒÂ¢?? to what he became, ÃƒÂ¢??a seamy looking drugstore cowboy-cum-derelict,ÃƒÂ¢?? as J. Hoberman put it in his Village Voice review.[1]\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢??s Get Lost begins near the end of BakerÃƒÂ¢??s life, on the beaches of Santa Monica, and ends at the Cannes Film Festival. Weber uses these moments in the present as bookends to the historic footage contained in the bulk of the film. The documentation ranges from vintage photographs by William Claxton in 1953 to appearances on The Steve Allen Show and kitschy, low budget Italian films Baker did for quick money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44958d2711fd49e66bc7e6e2a86bf0d73c5d533","amp;dn":"Chet+baker+-+Let%5C%27s+Get+Lost+-+by+Bruce+weber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44958d2711fd49e66bc7e6e2a86bf0d73c5d533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,73,88,210,113,31,212,158,102,188,126,110,42,134,191,13,115,197,213,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
