It follows standards-based principles, but also teaches readers ways around problems they are likely to face using (X)HTML. \nWhile XHTML is the &quot;current&quot; standard, the book still covers HTML because many people do not yet understand that XHTML is the official successor to HTML, and many readers will still stick with HTML for backward compatibility and simpler/informal Web pages that don't require XHTML compliance. \nThe book teaches basic principles of usability and accessibility along the way, to get users into the mode of developing Web pages that will be available to as many viewers as possible from the start. The book also covers the most commonly used programming/scripting language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ JavaScript ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and provides readers with a roadmap of other Web technologies to learn after mastering this book to add more functionality to their sites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:834687ff980e070c64b896ad8c404986294c2ce3","amp;dn":"Beginning+Web+Programming+with+HTML%2C+XHTML%2C+and+CSS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"834687ff980e070c64b896ad8c404986294c2ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,70,135,255,152,14,7,12,100,184,150,173,140,64,73,134,41,76,44,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
