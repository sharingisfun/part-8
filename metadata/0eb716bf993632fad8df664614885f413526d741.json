A British sergeant in the 95th Rifles saves the life of Arthur Wellesley, and finds himself promoted to Lieutenant and in charge of a company of Rifles that do not respect him, to carry out a dangerous and vital mission.\n\nSharpe may come to personify the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars in the same way that Horatio Hornblower does the Royal Navy. He becomes the leader of a force of Rifles cut off behind lines during the disastrous English retreat from Spain and battles not only crack French dragoons but also the fierce winter weather and the hostility of his men. A Spanish major offers aid if Sharpe will help with his own desperate mission to guarantee a Spanish victory. A crackling adventure yarn, sure to delight Sharpes many fans.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb716bf993632fad8df664614885f413526d741","amp;dn":"Sharpe%5C%27s+Enemy.S01E04.ENGSUB.DVDRip.XviD.+-+Lindoff+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eb716bf993632fad8df664614885f413526d741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,183,22,191,153,54,50,250,216,223,102,70,20,136,95,65,53,38,215,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
