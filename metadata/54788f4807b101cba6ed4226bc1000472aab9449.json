May 3] 1891 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ March 10, 1940) was a Soviet writer and playwright active in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his novel The Master and Margarita, which has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. \n\nDuring his life, Bulgakov was best known for the plays he contributed to Konstantin Stanislavsky's and Nemirovich-Danchenko's Moscow Art Theatre. Stalin was known to be fond of the play Days of the Turbins (1926), which was based on Bulgakov's novel The White Guard. His dramatization of MoliÃƒÂ¨re's life in The Cabal of Hypocrites (1936) is still performed by the Moscow Art Theatre. Even after his plays were banned from the theatres, Bulgakov wrote a comedy about Ivan the Terrible's visit into 1930s Moscow. His play Batum (1939) about the early years of Stalin was prohibited by the premier himself.\n\nBulgakov began writing prose with The White Guard (1924, partly published in 1925, first full edition 1927Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1929, Paris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a novel about a life of a White Army officer's family in civil war Kiev. In the mid-1920s, he came to admire the works of H. G. Wells and wrote several stories with elements of science fiction, notably The Fatal Eggs (1924) and Heart of a Dog (1925). He intended to compile his stories of the mid-twenties (published mostly in medical journals) that were based on his work as a country doctor in 1916Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1918 into a collection titled Notes of a Young Doctor, but he died before he could publish it.\n\nThe Fatal Eggs tells of the events of a Professor Persikov, who, in experimentation with eggs, discovers a red ray that accelerates growth in living organisms. At the time, an illness passes through the chickens of Moscow, killing most of them and, to remedy the situation, the Soviet government puts the ray into use at a farm. Due to a mix-up in egg shipments, the Professor ends up with chicken eggs, while the government-run farm receives the shipment of ostrich, snake and crocodile eggs ordered by the Professor. The mistake is not discovered until the eggs produce giant monstrosities that wreak havoc in the suburbs of Moscow and kill most of the workers on the farm. The propaganda machine turns on Persikov, distorting his nature in the same way his &quot;innocent&quot; tampering created the monsters. This tale of a bungling government earned Bulgakov his label of counter-revolutionary.\n\nHeart of a Dog features a professor who implants human testicles and a pituitary gland into a dog named Sharik (means &quot;Little Balloon&quot; or &quot;Little Ball&quot; - a popular Russian nickname for a male dog). The dog becomes more and more human as time passes, resulting in all manner of chaos. The tale can be read as a critical satire of liberal nihilsm and the communist mentality. It contains a few bold hints to the communist leadership; e.g. the name of the drunkard donor of the human organ implants is Chugunkin (&quot;chugun&quot; is cast iron) which can be seen as a parody on the name of Stalin (&quot;stal'&quot; is steel). It was adapted as a comic opera called The Murder of Comrade Sharik by William Bergsma in 1973. In 1988 an award-winning movie version Sobachye Serdtse was produced by Lenfilm, starring Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, Roman Kartsev and Vladimir Tolokonnikov.\n\n\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\n* A Country Doctor's Notebook (1975)\n\n* Diaboliad (1990)\n\n* Heart of a Dog (1968)\n\n* Notes on the Cuff &amp; Other Stories(1991)\n\n* The Fatal Eggs (1993)\n\n* The Master and Margarita (1967)\n\n* The White Guard (1926)\n\n\n\nRead the following articles, check out the websites, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/mar/20/will-self-white-guard-bulgakov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/mar/20/will-self-white-guard-bulgakov&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview19&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview19&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.masterandmargarita.eu/estore/pdf/emen037_sokolov.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.masterandmargarita.eu/estore/pdf/emen037_sokolov.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54788f4807b101cba6ed4226bc1000472aab9449","amp;dn":"Mikhail+Bulgakov+-+Novels+and+Short+Stories+%287+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54788f4807b101cba6ed4226bc1000472aab9449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,120,143,72,7,177,1,203,166,237,66,38,188,16,0,71,42,171,148,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
