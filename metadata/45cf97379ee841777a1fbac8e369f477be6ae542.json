The lead character, a young athlete, named Morgan Oliver (played by Leo Manaya), is first seen wallowing in a state of depression, drowning his sorrows in beer as he watches bicycle racing (the sport that at once defined his sense of purpose and drove him to his catalytic accident) on television.\n\nWhile in rehabilitation, he meets Dean Kagan (played by Jack Kesy) who helps him through the way and a romantic relationship develops between the two. Once Morgan knows about the New York Haven Cycle Race, he decides to take part in the race with the help of Kagan and sponsorship from Tread Bike Shop.\n\n\nEnglish hard-coded sub.\n\n\n01:26:54\n624x344\n23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45cf97379ee841777a1fbac8e369f477be6ae542","amp;dn":"2012+Morgan+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45cf97379ee841777a1fbac8e369f477be6ae542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,207,151,55,158,232,65,119,122,31,186,200,227,105,244,119,190,106,229,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
