They have two teenaged daughters. They have built a life together. Forty-three year old Gabby is the last person to have an affair. She canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t relate to the way her friends desperately try to cling to the beauty and allure of their younger yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAnd yet, she too knows her youth is quickly slipping away. She could never imagine how good it would feel to have a handsome younger man show interest in herÃ¢â‚¬â€until the night it happens.
