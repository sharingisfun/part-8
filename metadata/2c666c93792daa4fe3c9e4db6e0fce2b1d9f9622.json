Le Guin:\r\n\r\n&quot;I read her nonstop growing up and read her still. What makes her so extraordinary for me is that her commitment to the consequences of our actions, of our all too human frailties, is unflinching and almost without precedent for a writer of such human optimism.&quot;â€”Junot Diaz\r\n\r\n&quot;A lot of her work is about telling stories, and what it means to tell stories, and what stories look like. She's been extremely influential on me in that area of what I, as a beginning writer, thought a story must look like, and the much more expan-sive view I have now of what a story can be and can do.&quot;â€”Karen Joy Fowler\r\n\r\n&quot;She was and remains a central figure for me.&quot;â€”Michael Chabon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c666c93792daa4fe3c9e4db6e0fce2b1d9f9622","amp;dn":"Words+Are+My+Matter+Writings+About+Life+and+Books+2016+WWRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c666c93792daa4fe3c9e4db6e0fce2b1d9f9622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,102,108,147,121,45,170,79,227,201,228,219,110,15,206,43,29,159,150,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
