Georg's highest wish is to become a father himself. But his biggest fear is to become like Frank, an intolerable paranoiac. While still sane, he starts to write letters to his future son as he continues to search for a worthwhile mother for him. Meanwhile, the favored young brother Terje (33) and their mother Bente (59) struggle to keep up with everyday life. When an unknown member of the family suddenly shows up, the members of this broken family realize they aren't rid of each other just yet.\n\nTrailer:\n\nDVDRip XviD MP3 Avi - 640 x 352 - 6x58 min\n\nIf you like it: Buy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1b1f9403ee6f1c41003e6f67af0b69f87e68c1","amp;dn":"Koselig+med+peis+%5BNorwegian+Cozy%5D+%282010%29+Thomas+Torjussen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1b1f9403ee6f1c41003e6f67af0b69f87e68c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,27,31,148,3,238,111,28,65,0,62,111,103,175,11,105,248,126,104,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
