In her interviews she credits the diary of Anne Frank, which she first read in middle school, with opening her eyes to writing as an outlet for self-expression. Ogawa studied creative writing in college and began producing works in earnest upon graduation, marking her professional debut by winning the 1998 Kaien Prize for New Writers with the story Agehacho ga kowareru toki (Disintegration of the Butterfly). She went on to receive numerous honors, including the 1990 Akutagawa Prize for her novella Ninshin karenda (Pregnancy Calendar, later translated as Pregnancy Diary) and, most notably, the 2003 Yomiuri Prize for Literature and the inaugural Booksellers Award for her best-selling novel The Housekeeper and the Professor (English translation from Picador, 2009). Other notable works include the Izumi Kyoka Prize-winning Burafuman no maiso (Brahman's Burial, 2004) and Hitojichi no rodokukai (The Hostage's Reading, 2011). Three of Ogawa's booksÃ¢â‚¬â€The Housekeeper and the Professor, The Diving Pool: Three Novellas (Picador, 2008) and Hotel Iris (Picador, 2010)Ã¢â‚¬â€have been translated into English.
