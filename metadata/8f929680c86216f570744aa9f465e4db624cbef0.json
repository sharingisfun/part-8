Provost and Keri L. Colabroy\r\nWiley | May 2016 | ISBN-10: 1118674200 | 544 Pages | PDF | 38.7 mb\r\n\r\nWritten as a textbook with an online laboratory manual for students and adopting faculties, this work is intended for non-science majors / liberal studies science courses and will cover a range of scientific principles of food, cooking and the science of taste and smell.  Chapters include: The Science of Food and Nutrition of Macromolecules; Science of Taste and Smell; Milk, Cream, and Ice Cream, Metabolism and Fermentation; Cheese, Yogurt, and Sour Cream; Browning; Fruits and Vegetables; Meat, Fish, and Eggs; Dough, Cakes, and Pastry; Chilies, Herbs, and Spices; Beer and Wine; and Chocolate, Candy and Other Treats. Each chapters begins with biological, chemical, and /or physical principles underlying food topics, and a discussion of what is happening at the molecular level. This unique approach is unique should be attractive to chemistry, biology or biochemistry departments looking for a new way to bring students into their classroom. There are no pre-requisites for the course and the work is appropriate for all college levels and majors.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface xi\r\nAbout the Authors xiii\r\nAbout the Companion Website xvii\r\n1 The Science of Food and Cooking: Macromolecules 1\r\n2 The Science of Taste and Smell 55\r\n3 Milk and Ice Cream 93\r\n4 Metabolism of Food: Microorganisms and Beyond 127\r\n5 Cheese, Yogurt, and Sour Cream 159\r\n6 Browning 193\r\n7 Fruits and Vegetables 227\r\n8 Meat and Fish 273\r\n9 Eggs, Custards, and Foams 311\r\n10 Bread, Cakes, and Pastry 343\r\n11 Seasonings: Salt, Spices, Herbs, and Hot Peppers 381\r\n12 Beer and Wine 423\r\n13 S weets: Chocolates and Candies 469\r\nIndex 513\r\n \nhttps://s32.postimg.org/m0l2u47jp/The_Science_of_Cooking.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f929680c86216f570744aa9f465e4db624cbef0","amp;dn":"The+Science+of+Cooking+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f929680c86216f570744aa9f465e4db624cbef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,146,150,128,200,98,22,245,112,116,74,169,244,101,228,219,98,76,190,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
