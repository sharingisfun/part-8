The band as it was at the time consisted of Jesper, Johan Larsson and Glenn LjungstrÃƒÂ¶m. A demo was recorded and soon after the band got a record deal and released Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lunar StrainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and it did not take long before the album was a classic in the fast growing Scandinavian death metal scene.\n\nWith a new line up consisting of Jesper, Johan &amp; Glenn along with two new additions: Anders FridÃƒÂ©n on vocals and BjÃƒÂ¶rn Gelotte on drums, In Flames signed a license deal with Nuclear Blast Records and soon started recording the follow up: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Jester RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Jester RaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quickly became a big hit all across Europe and Japan.\n\nAfter the recording of Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoracleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 1997 Johan and Glenn decided to leave the band and Peter Iwers (bass) joined. Niclas Engelin (Gardenian, Engel) was temporarily in the band filling in on guitars. With a fresh line up the band set sails and headed out on tour. Short after a very successful European tour Niclas had to focus on his other projects, and BjÃƒÂ¶rn switched from drums to guitar and Daniel Svensson joined the band, and this is the In Flames as we know it today. With the completion of the line up Ã¢â‚¬Å“ColonyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was recorded and released in 1999.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ColonyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ took In Flames to a new level and the band sold out venues across Europe, USA and Japan and quickly became one of the biggest and most popular Melodic Death Metal acts around.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ClaymanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was released in 2000 even topped its predecessor and the awards started pouring in and the band kept growing in popularity. In 2001 Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Tokyo ShowdownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, In Flames first live album was released, and gave the public and insight to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live competence.\n\nModern and more mature Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reroute To RemainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2002) again confirmed the status of In Flames and marked another milestone in their career. Two years later and it was time to take In Flames to a new level. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Soundtrack To Your EscapeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ did just that and was the logical continuation after Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reroute To RemainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn Flames continued to tour the world and documented these escapades, which resulted in the release of the phenomenal DVD/CD package Ã¢â‚¬Å“Used And Abused Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In Live We TrustÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2005. With an incredibly successful world tour behind them, In Flames recorded the masterpiece Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come ClarityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which was released in March 2006. The song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take This LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the album is featured on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guitar Hero IIIÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game.\n\nA game which has been deemed the bestselling video game of all times.\n\nIn September 2007 In Flames entered IF STUDIOS, in Gothenburg, Sweden, to record A Sense Of Purpose. The album was Recorded and produced by the band together with Daniel Bergstrand (vocals) and Roberto Laghi (Bass, guitar &amp; drums) and mixed by Toby Wright in LA (Metallica, Slayer, Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss, Motley Crue etc) and mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Marcussen mastering studios in LA.\n\nIn April 2008 A Sense Of Purpose entered charts all over the world incl # 1 in Sweden and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest ever entry on the American Billboard top 200 with an amazing #28. In Canada In Flames achieved the very same thing with a #7 on the Canadian Billboard top 200. Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Sense Of PurposeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was at the time of release the 7th most sold album in the whole of Europe!\n\n2008 was spent touring, starting with a main support slot to Megadeth in North America, followed by breaking the attendance record at the famous Swedish GrÃƒÂ¶na Lund with 15.500 people in the audience. NO other Swedish artist has ever had that many people at a single show there. Moving on to 18 European summer festivals, in front of a total of 300 000 people.\n\nAfter that the band finished what became In Flames biggest ever European headline tour at the time attended by over 60 000 people ending with 4 completely sold out Swedish shows attracting 13 000 people. 2008 ended in style with the most successful North American Headline tour to date for the band.\n\n2009 started off with IN FLAMES performing live at the Swedish Grammi Awards, the most prestigious of all Swedish awards. The band also won a Grammi for best metal band.\n\n2009 continued where 2008 left off, with heavy touring: South America, Australia, Japan, Eastern Europe.\n\nOn May 21st 2009 Ã¢â‚¬Å“DisconnectedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was released on Guitar Hero World Tour as a downloadable track. This is the second In Flames track featured on Guitar Hero. In Flames have previously been featured on Guitar Hero III Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Legends Of Rock\n\nThe summer of 2009 saw In Flames conquer some of the biggest European festivals leading right into the third Canada/USA tour on this album (2nd Headline tour).\n\n2009 ended in style with the hugely successful Rockstar Taste Of Chaos Tour, which the band headlined. In Sweden the band played their biggest ever headline gigs so far in their career. Over three shows more than 19 000 people attended and established In Flames as one of the biggest bands in Sweden, all categories.\n\nIn the beginning of 2010 the band took some well-deserved time off. Only three shows played over the summer. One of them was Metal Town in Gothenburg where over 25 000 people saw one of the biggest productions in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career. It was well liked. In fact when all 50 000 feet jumped the pier on which the festival is set was set in motion and in its turn it set off the Ã¢â‚¬Å“earthquake alarmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the nearby bridge because it was moving too much. Now THATÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S a crowd!\n\nIn September 2010 In Flames once again entered their own IF Studios together with Roberto Laghi, Daniel Bergstrand and Ãƒâ€“rjan Ãƒâ€“rnkloo to start the recording of the new album. The album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sounds Of A Playground FadingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is planned for release sometime in the first half of 2011.\n\n                  \nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. In Plain View\n2.
