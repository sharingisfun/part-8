Here is a samples gallery of these pictures. On the Mazaika page you can see screenshots and few mosaic examples. There are lot more example pictures at gallery section. Besides many small pictures there are some very hi res pictures which you can print as big as A3 or even larger. \n\nUsing Mazaika you can make professional looking mosaic pictures from almost any kind and type of image files. You can use even simple icon files (at size 32x32 pixels) to create very impressive mosaic pictures. If you have a digital camera, you can use your own pictures as tiles. Note that even in trial version of Mazaika you have no limit on the image database size and you could use as many of your own custom picture tiles as you want - or rather, as you have :-). \n\nIn the Mazaika Users Gallery section of our site you may find a number of real photographic mosaic examples created by the users of our software. \n\nMazaika is the ONLY photo mosaic application that allows manual changes to every single tile in the finished mosaic. If you don&amp;#039;t like an image, substitute it with another matching candidate image! And even more! You might insert custom images as a sort of personal signature, or as a hidden picture riddle (as in a &quot;Where are they?&quot; puzzle book). Or you might need to make sure that a particularly well-liked image is not passed over as a tile; for example that Uncle Ernie appears somewhere in your final mosaic. \n\nIf you&amp;#039;re short on image files - you can download some of our image collections (for instance, about 3500 lp/cd covers or windows icon collection). Also we have placed a part of our postcard collection that we have used for mosaic creation. There are 700+ vintage Soviet New Year postcards here\n\n\nenjoy//rj","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42301a50e25f50bb68226b29445398f00c85095f","amp;dn":"Mazaika+2.7+include+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42301a50e25f50bb68226b29445398f00c85095f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,48,26,80,226,95,80,187,104,34,107,41,68,83,152,240,12,133,9,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
