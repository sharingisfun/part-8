It is a depiction of the Second Coming of Christ and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ surrounded by prominent saints including Saints Catherine of Alexandria, Peter, Lawrence, Bartholomew, Paul, Sebastian, John the Baptist, and others. The work took four years to complete and was done between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall began in 1535.) Michelangelo began working on it twenty five years after having finished the Sistine Chapel ceiling","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7769bbeb4286de5a258e1a13c85cf567cdac1c","amp;dn":"Michelangelo+-+The+Last+Judgment+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7769bbeb4286de5a258e1a13c85cf567cdac1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,119,105,187,235,66,134,222,90,37,142,26,19,200,92,245,103,205,172,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
