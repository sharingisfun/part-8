After ten days, the bank no longer existed, its assets sold under duress to rival JPMorgan Chase. The effects would be felt nationwide, as the country suddenly found itself in the grip of the worst financial mess since the Great Depression. William Cohan exposes the corporate arrogance, power struggles, and deadly combination of greed and inattention, which led to the collapse of not only Bear Stearns but the very foundations of Wall Street.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Finance&gt; Current Events\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05f444f2627b1fef693a5bfb16fb5cfaab02a319","amp;dn":"House+of+Cards_+A+Tale+of+Hubris+and+Wretched+Excess+on+Wall+Str","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05f444f2627b1fef693a5bfb16fb5cfaab02a319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,244,68,242,98,123,31,239,105,58,91,251,22,251,92,250,171,2,163,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
