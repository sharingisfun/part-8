These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration, and made possible the voyages of discovery that ensued. The molecules resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine and law; they determined what we now eat, drink, and wear. A change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous alterations in the properties of a substance-which, in turn, can result in great historical shifts.\n\nWith lively prose and an eye for colorful and unusual details, Le Couteur and Burreson offer a novel way to understand the shaping of civilization and the workings of our contemporary world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4329564b94fad1592619957f834ea129b2edae5e","amp;dn":"Napoleon%27s+Buttons+-+How+17+Molecules+Changed+History.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4329564b94fad1592619957f834ea129b2edae5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,41,86,75,148,250,209,89,38,25,149,127,131,78,161,41,178,237,174,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
