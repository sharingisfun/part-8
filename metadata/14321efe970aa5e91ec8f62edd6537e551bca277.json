In each topic, key ideas are introduced and basic formulas to understand phenomenological outcomes are derived. Experimental techniques to detect them are also explained. Finally, most recent data and future prospects are reviewed. The book can be used to give a quick view of specialized topics to high energy and theoretical physicists as well as to astronomers and graduate students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14321efe970aa5e91ec8f62edd6537e551bca277","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Standard+Model+of+Elementary+Particle+Physics+%5B2014%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14321efe970aa5e91ec8f62edd6537e551bca277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,50,30,254,151,10,165,233,30,200,246,46,221,101,55,229,81,188,162,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
