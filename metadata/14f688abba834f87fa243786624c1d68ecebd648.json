It&amp;#039;s just a shame that the same dynamics were born with Husker Du, minted by The Pixies, and perfected by Nirvana while Bush were still gigging their way around London&amp;#039;s fleapits, waiting for their big break. No, Razorblade Suitcase--like Bush&amp;#039;s debut, Sixteen Stone--isn&amp;#039;t actually that bad. It&amp;#039;s just perplexing to see a band this successful make a career out of stepping in other band&amp;#039;s footsteps. Steve Albini, producer of Razorblade Suitcase does his erstwhile best to pervert Bush&amp;#039;s radio-clean grunge, as on &quot;Insect Kin&quot;--but as he was the producer of Nirvana&amp;#039;s In Utero, you can&amp;#039;t help but feel that Razorblade Suitcase apes that record&amp;#039;s fractured angst as surely as Sixteen Stone crept in on the tail of Nevermind.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f688abba834f87fa243786624c1d68ecebd648","amp;dn":"Bush+-+Razorblade+Suitcase","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f688abba834f87fa243786624c1d68ecebd648","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,246,136,171,186,131,79,135,250,36,55,134,98,76,29,104,236,235,214,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
