The band is led by vocalist and guitarist John Haughm and so far have released five full-length albums, four limited EPs, two demos, one split album, one compilation album and one live video album.\nFormation and early years (1995Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1997)\n\nAgalloch began as the creation of John Haughm and Shane Breyer, named after the resinous wood of the Agarwood (Aquilaria agallocha). In early 1996, the duo began producing songs and, during the summer, Don Anderson joined the band to further refine the material. These songs would later become the From Which of This Oak demo tape in the autumn of that year. This recording showed a large amount of black metal influence, with an amount of material which would later appear on subsequent albums in one form or another. Shortly after the recording, Jason William Walton was added to the line up as bassist.\nPale Folklore and Of Stone, Wind and Pillor (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2001)\n\nIn 1998, the three recorded a new demo tape solely for labels. It caught the attention of The End Records, who offered them a record contract, resulting in the Pale Folklore album. The album features less of a black metal influence than before, many totally reworked demo songs, more folk elements and neoclassical interludes. The album was met with much critical acclaim. After the recording was complete, Breyer departed from the band lineup due to lack of interest in music.\n\nAfter a period of quiet, the band released an EP of unreleased material from 1998-2001 entitled Of Stone, Wind and Pillor, revealing more of a neoclassical and experimental element. The EP also includes a cover of neofolk band Sol Invictus' &quot;Kneel to the Cross&quot; that would later be released on Sol Lucet Omnibus, French label Cynerfierrd's tribute compilation to Sol Invictus.\nThe Serpent &amp; The Sphere (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nOn October 13, 2013, Agalloch stated they have &quot;a new album in the works&quot;On January 31, 2014 Agalloch announced that their new album The Serpent &amp; The Sphere would be released on May 13. The album, just like their previous album Marrow of the Spirit, will be released on Profound Lore Records.\nStyle\n\nAgalloch performs a progressive and avant-garde style of folk metal that encompasses an eclectic range of tendencies including neofolk, post-rock, black metal and doom metal.\n\nCommon themes in Agalloch's imagery and subject matter are natural beauty, melancholy and allusions to ancestral Heathenry.\n\nOne of the non-traditional instruments Agalloch has been known to use is the skull of a deer. In the song &quot;The Lodge&quot; John Haughm strikes the deer skull in order to create an unusual clicking sound.\n\nIn a 1999 interview done by Dan Tobin with Jason William Walton and John Haughm the band members have cited other influences including Katatonia, Ulver, The 3rd and the Mortal, Swans, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. In another interview with metal-rules.com, the band cites filmmakers such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Jim Jarmusch, and Ingmar Bergman as influences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0cd166ac051abad76e707d71e5aae1d31057378","amp;dn":"Agalloch+-+The+Serpent+And+The+Sphere%28Japanese+Edition%29+mp3+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0cd166ac051abad76e707d71e5aae1d31057378","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,205,22,106,192,81,171,173,118,231,7,215,30,90,174,29,49,5,115,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
