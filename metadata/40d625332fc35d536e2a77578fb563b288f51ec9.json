Programmers using the Visual Basic 2008 language have the ability to write applications ranging from simple user-friendly front-end interfaces to complex database applications. VB 2008 applications can be deployed as stand-alone or web-based applications. This tutorial by Arthur Lee assumes no prior programming background and uses a building block approach beginning with simple programming features and examples while gradually introducing more complex features. Where appropriate, new features that have been introduced in the 2008 version of Visual Basic will be explained. Coding examples are provided to be referenced by the user to enhance their learning experience.\n\nExercise Files are Included\n\n1. Extract Exercise Files with 7-zip\n\n2.
