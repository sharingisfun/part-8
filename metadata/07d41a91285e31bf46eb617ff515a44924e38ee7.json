A hell-raising maverick with no patience for fools, he is admired by his friends, feared by his enemies, and desired by the world's loveliest women. Acting as a 21st privateer, Randolph broke the political strangle-hold on space exploration, and became one of the world's richest men in the bargain.\n\nNow an ecological crisis threatens EarthÃ¢â‚¬â€and the same politicians that Randolph outwitted the first time want to impose a world dictatorship to deal with it.\n\nDan Randolph knows that the answer lies in more human freedom, not lessÃ¢â‚¬â€and in the boundless resources of space. But can he stay free long enough to give the world that chance?\n\n\nNarrated by: Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 11 hrs and 49 mins \nSeries: Grand Tour (Bova), Book 3\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:02-26-10\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07d41a91285e31bf46eb617ff515a44924e38ee7","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Empire+Builders++%28The+Grand+Tour+%233%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07d41a91285e31bf46eb617ff515a44924e38ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,212,26,145,40,94,49,191,70,235,97,127,245,21,164,73,36,227,142,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
