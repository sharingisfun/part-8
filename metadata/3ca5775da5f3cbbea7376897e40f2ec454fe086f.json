Part cookbook, part travelogue, filled with gorgeous photography, stunning recipes, and interviews with locals, and packed with the often quirky secrets to a long life that Ikarians are spoon-fed at birth, Ikaria is award-winning author Diane KochilasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethno-culinary paean to this magical island.\n\nHere, Kochilas will marry lore to lesson and recipe to interview: weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet a 101-year-old weaverÃ¢â‚¬â€the best on the islandÃ¢â‚¬â€and taste the combinations of herbs that he cooks with and that he believes give him life. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about the life-giving benefits of delicious salads both raw and cooked, the gorgeous breads and savory pies that are a part of every meal, the bean dishes that are passed down through generations, and the seafood that is at the root of the Ikarian culinary culture. filled with mouthwatering recipes and remarkable stories, this book will introduce many Americans to food as life, as only the Ikarians know it.\n\nAbout the Author\nAward-winning author DIANE KOCHILAS divides her time between New York, Athens, and her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancestral island, Ikaria, where she and her husband, Vasilis Stenos, run the Glorious Greek Kitchen cooking school.
