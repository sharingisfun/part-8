She possessed a voice of beauty and power, combining extraordinary agility, accurate intonation, pinpoint staccatos, a splendid trill and a tremendous upper register, although music critics often complained about the imprecision of her diction. Her friend Luciano Pavarotti once called Sutherland the &quot;Voice of the Century&quot;, while Montserrat CaballÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© described the Australian's voice as being like &quot;heaven&quot;. Her highest note was a high F-sharp in altissimo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cac4ca690b9b04c0c1b965fc865ea471749cdc7","amp;dn":"Joan+Sutherland+-+Greatest+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cac4ca690b9b04c0c1b965fc865ea471749cdc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,172,76,166,144,185,176,76,12,27,150,95,200,101,234,71,23,73,205,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
