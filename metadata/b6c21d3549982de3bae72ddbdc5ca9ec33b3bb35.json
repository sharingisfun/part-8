It's about creating a personalized weight loss planÃ¢â‚¬â€your own easiest path to naturally thin. While you can lose weight with almost any diet, keeping the weight off is much more difficult, requiring permanent changes in eating and exercise habits. This book provides a science-based approach for making those changes in a way that works best for you, without wasting time, money, or effort.\n\n\nDr. Spencer explains why we gain weight and why the fat lost by dieting almost always comes back. He then presents an array of practical weight loss tools for controlling emotional eating, calming cravings, boosting metabolism, and improving nutrition and exercise. In the final chapter he has you create a natural weight loss plan based on your unique set of needs, abilities, and preferences. Simple recipes are provided for weight loss foods that reduce cravings and prolong satisfaction.\n\nWhat this book offers is a solid approach to weight lossÃ¢â‚¬â€self-directed, gradual, and lastingÃ¢â‚¬â€in contrast to the quick but fleeting weight loss offered by most one-size-fits-all diet plans.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c21d3549982de3bae72ddbdc5ca9ec33b3bb35","amp;dn":"The+Diet+Dropout%27s+Guide+to+Natural+Weight+Loss%3A+Find+Your+Easie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c21d3549982de3bae72ddbdc5ca9ec33b3bb35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,194,29,53,73,152,45,227,186,231,45,219,220,92,169,236,51,179,187,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
