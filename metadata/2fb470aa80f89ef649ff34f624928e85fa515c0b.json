The era (1983) saw smaller trains, usually between 40 and 50 cars.\n\nThe Denver &amp; Rio Grande was able to compete with other roads by running short, fast, trains over their mountainous profile.\n\nAccurate D&amp;RGW locomotives, including EMD GP30, SD45, and SD40T-2 &quot;Tunnel Motors&quot;\n27 pieces of high quality rolling stock\nAll locomotives and rolling stock come with cabviews, detailed physics characteristics and high quality 22 khz audio\n180 miles of busy single track railroading\nCTC Signaling\nDetailed scenery and terrain objects\nChallenging Activities\nCustom sounds and cab views","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb470aa80f89ef649ff34f624928e85fa515c0b","amp;dn":"msts.addon.drgw.greenriver.route.%5BFrankFoo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb470aa80f89ef649ff34f624928e85fa515c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,180,112,170,128,248,158,246,73,255,52,246,36,146,142,133,250,81,92,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
