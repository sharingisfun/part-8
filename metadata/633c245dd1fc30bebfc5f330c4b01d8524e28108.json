One of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, he transformed philosophy and can lay claim to being one of the greatest philosophers of all time. He was a Nobel Prize winner for Literature and was imprisoned several times as a result of his pacifism. His views on religion, education, sex, politics and many other topics, made him one of the most read and revered writers of the age. This, his autobiography, is one of the most compelling and vivid ever written.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633c245dd1fc30bebfc5f330c4b01d8524e28108","amp;dn":"The+Autobiography+Of+Bertrand+Russell+%5Bpdf+scan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633c245dd1fc30bebfc5f330c4b01d8524e28108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,60,36,93,209,252,48,190,191,197,243,48,196,176,29,133,36,226,129,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
