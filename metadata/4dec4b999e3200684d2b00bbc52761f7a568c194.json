Based on the Royal Shakespeare Company's acclaimed stage production, Gregory Doran's film for BBC Television sets the action in post-independence Africa. With echos of the recent overthrow of dictators during the 'Arab Spring', the production explores the implications of political assassination and the unpredictability of its aftermath.&quot; -- Container.\n\n\nThe Making of RSC Julius Caesar;   43 mins. 29 sec.\n\n   An important interview with the director in which Doran describes how Julius Caesar was widely read as a text in Africa before this RSC production was made with an all black cast and filming done not only on stage but also on location.  The message about regime change was understood well on the African continent.\n\n\nShakespeare Unlocked;  58 mins. 43 sec.\n\n   This was a series broadcast in the summer of 2012.  In the Unlocked episode of the RSC Julius Caesar we see how the actors preparation was made for the production.\n\n\nMy notes\n\n   The torrent is given to bring together the RSC production of Julius Caesar and the extras which are on the DVD but also for the separate episode of Shakespeare Unlocked.  Here again, I encourage viewers of these torrents to request that their libraries acquire the originals so that more may enjoy and experience this remarkable production.\n\nNotes written October 17, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dec4b999e3200684d2b00bbc52761f7a568c194","amp;dn":"Royal+Shakespeare+Company+Julius+Caesar+%282012%29+includes+extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dec4b999e3200684d2b00bbc52761f7a568c194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,236,75,153,158,50,0,104,77,43,0,187,197,39,97,247,165,104,193,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
