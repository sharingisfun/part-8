For most of its existence, Everclear consisted of Art Alexakis (vocals and guitar), Craig Montoya (bass guitar and vocals), and Greg Eklund (drums, percussion and vocals). Eklund replaced original drummer Scott Cuthbert in 1994. Montoya and Eklund departed the band in 2003, but Alexakis continued the band with Dave &quot;Davey&quot; French (lead guitar), Josh Crawley (keyboards), Sam Hudson (bass guitar), and Tommy Stewart (drums, percussion).
