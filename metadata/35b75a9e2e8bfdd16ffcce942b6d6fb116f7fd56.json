As the Red Army rampages through Berlin, Hitler and his\nstaff have retreated to the bunker under the Reich Chancellery. They are all\nhereÃ¢â‚¬â€Himmler, Goebbels, Speer, the entire fascinating, loathsome crew of\ncommanders, mad visionaries, and toadies (all brilliantly acted)Ã¢â‚¬â€and, leading\nthem still, a man so physically ill and constricted in movement that he looks\nlike a broken-down puppet from a Bavarian traveling circus. The puppet comes to\nlife, of course, in appalling self-pitying rants that are borderline funny. The\nentire movie teeters on the edge of sick comedy-in particular such scenes as the\ndeath of the Goebbels children, one by one, at the hands of their motherÃ¢â‚¬â€and at\ntimes one longs for a coldly malicious ironist like Brecht or Fassbinder to come\nin and take over. The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always\nbeen morally and imaginatively questionableÃ¢â‚¬â€a compromise with the unspeakable\nthat borders on complicity with it.\n\n\nTorrent released August 11, 2006, re-uploaded Jun 16, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b75a9e2e8bfdd16ffcce942b6d6fb116f7fd56","amp;dn":"Der+Untergang+%2F+Downfall+%28Extended+Edition%29+2004+DVDRip+-+German","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b75a9e2e8bfdd16ffcce942b6d6fb116f7fd56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,183,90,158,46,139,253,209,111,252,206,148,43,109,111,177,22,247,253,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
