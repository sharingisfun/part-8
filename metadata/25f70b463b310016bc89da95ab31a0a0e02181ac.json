Taken from the Japanese words wabi, which translates to less is more, and sabi, which means attentive melancholy, wabi sabi refers to an awareness of the transient nature of earthly things and a corresponding pleasure in the things that bear the mark of this impermanence. As a design style, wabi sabi helps us to appreciate the simple beauty in imperfection--of a chipped vase or a rainy day, for example.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f70b463b310016bc89da95ab31a0a0e02181ac","amp;dn":"Wabi+Sabi+-+The+Japanese+Art+of+Impermanence+%28Art+Design+Philoso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f70b463b310016bc89da95ab31a0a0e02181ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,247,11,70,59,49,0,22,188,137,218,149,171,49,160,160,224,33,129,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
