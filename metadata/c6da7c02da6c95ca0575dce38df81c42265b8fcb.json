Along with his direct lyrical style, these gentler aspects help shape the album into an intimate listening experience..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6da7c02da6c95ca0575dce38df81c42265b8fcb","amp;dn":"Terry+Allen+-+Bottom+of+the+World%5B2012%5D+%5BEAC.Log%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6da7c02da6c95ca0575dce38df81c42265b8fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,218,124,2,218,108,149,202,5,117,220,227,141,248,28,66,38,91,143,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
