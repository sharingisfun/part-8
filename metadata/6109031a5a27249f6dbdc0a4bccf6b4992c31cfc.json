Griffith - Orphans of the Storm (1921)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012532/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012532/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[quote]D.W. Griffith has tossed two orphans onto the tempestuous sea of the French Revolution and uses the ride-to-the-rescue for a finale, with an orphan under the guillotine and 'Danton five miles away'. This scene is drawn out agonizingly but does not let down in any spot.\n\nThe cavalry ride through the town, the storming of the moated guillotine gates, the last-minute reprieve and the hesitating release trigger on the guillotine all make for a dramatic final reel with a Griffith thrill that will compensate those who are not won by the unbelievable fidelity of the entire film historically.\n\nThe plot [based on the French play Les Deux Orphelines, by D'Ennery and Cormon] carries the two orphan girls, one blind, into Paris. Dorothy Gish is the blind girl, and this step from comedienne roles into a role of unlimited emotional possibilities reveals new capabilities in the less famous of the two Gish girls.[/quote]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img122.imageshack.us/img122/2420/orphansofthestormdriffithcover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img122.imageshack.us/img122/2420/orphansofthestormdriffithcover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[quote]&quot;No more gorgeous thing has ever been offered on the the screen. It has motion within motion, action within action, and it builds up to crashing climaxes with all that superb deftnition which makes Mr Griffith first and always the showman&quot;. So read one review in Moving Picture World after Orphans of the Storm premiered. After watching the film you might agree that the comments are exaggerated, yet still relevant more that 70 years after they were written. D.W. Griffith, the father of the motion picture, was directing his favourite actress, Lillian Gish, and her sister Dorothy, in this melodramatic epic set in revolutionary France.\n\nThe story has Henriette and Louise as the orphaned sisters enduring a series of tribulations designed to tug your heart strings. Louise is blind, and cruelly separated from her sister, raised by thieves, and Henriette is the sweet innocent plundered by lecherous aristocrats. It's an implausible tale, but casting that aside it's also a beautiful fairy story with an excellent climax that has Henriette facing the guillotine. Griffith and Lillian Gish together made a series of films that are truly &quot;classic&quot; - Birth Of A Nation, Broken Blossoms, Hearts Of The World, Intolerance, True Heart Susie and Way Down East. Most are only known to film buffs and historians, becoming slightiy creaky after the passage of time. They were all silent movies, and different to anything then or since, and Orphans is one of the best examples that captures the particular mood and magic Griffith could create.\n\nGriffith also subtly put in an anti-communist message, with title cards like &quot;The tyranny of kings and nobles is hard to bear, but the tyranny of the maddened mob under blood-lusting rulers is intolerable&quot; and others that stab at anarchy and bolshevism. But he was mainly interested in making a good film that would enthrall its audience.[/quote] \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o1-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o1-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o2-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o2-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o3-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o3-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o4-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o4-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o5-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o5-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o6-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/o6-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------my rip-------\n\nMy source did not have any of the color tints which I believe the original film did. \n\nAfter a lot of trial and error I was able to clean up the interlacing nicely and restore the framerate to 20FPS using\n\ntdeint(order=-1)\nDecimate(cycle=3)\n\n~~~~~~ Orphans of the Storm.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................2,069,397,504                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:29:56                \nFrame Count:....................................179726             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................688                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................512                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.344                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................19.980          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1736                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.247&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................32000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................96                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2\n\n[quote]Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
