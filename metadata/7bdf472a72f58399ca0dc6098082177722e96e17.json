Just individual songs downloaded from Itunes... God, Lennon is rolling over in his grave.  This is why Neil Aspinhall quit Apple Records!  I took the time to convert the 2009 remastered Box Set using dBpoweramp to MP3 using the VBR setting -V2.5 estimated bit rate 180kps encoding slow (high quality). Obviously my FLAC files sound much better but the music here peaks at 256-320kps.  Everything fits nicely on one CDR to share with the uninitiated younger generations... or to play in your car set on shuffle.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bdf472a72f58399ca0dc6098082177722e96e17","amp;dn":"BEATLES+Discography+%282009+Stereo+Box+Set%29+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bdf472a72f58399ca0dc6098082177722e96e17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,223,71,42,114,245,131,153,202,13,198,9,128,130,23,119,34,233,110,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
