She is the first female bass player to become a major rock star. This broke a barrier to women's participation in rock music.\n\nIn the 1970s Quatro scored a string of hit singles that found greater success in Europe and Australia than in her homeland. But, following a recurring role as a female bass player on the popular American sitcom Happy Days, her duet &quot;Stumblin' In&quot; with Chris Norman reached number 4 in the USA in 1979.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1980 Quatro was awarded six Bravo Ottos. In 2010 she was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame. Quatro has sold over 50 million albums and continues to perform live, worldwide. Her most recent album was released in 2011 and she also continues to present new radio programmes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuatro's paternal grandfather was an Italian immigrant to the US. His family name of &quot;Quattrocchi&quot; was shortened by the immigration authorities because they found it too difficult to pronounce. Quatro's Catholic family were living in Detroit, Michigan when she was born. She has three sisters and a brother, and her parents fostered several other children while she was growing up. Her father, Art, was a semi-professional musician and worked at General Motors. Her mother, Helen, was Hungarian. In this environment, Quatro grew to be &quot;extrovert but solitary&quot;, according to Norman, and she only became close to her mother after leaving the US for England.\n\nHer sister Arlene is the mother of actress Sherilyn Fenn. Her sister Patti joined Fanny, one of the earliest all-female rock bands to gain national attention. Quatro has a brother, Michael Quatro, who is also a musician.\n\nQuatro married her long-time guitarist Len Tuckey in 1976. They had two children together (Laura in 1982 and Richard Leonard in 1984) and divorced in 1992. Before 1993, Quatro lived with her two children in a manor house in Essex that she and Tuckey bought in 1980. She married German concert promoter Rainer Haas in 1993. In 2006 her daughter and grandchild moved into the manor house again. Toward the end of 2008, Quatro's children moved out of the house and she temporarily put it up for sale, stating that she had empty nest syndrome. Quatro continues to live in Essex, England.\n\nOn 31 March 2012, Quatro broke her right knee and left wrist while boarding an aircraft in Kiev, where she had performed the night before. She had to cancel her appearance at the Detroit Music Awards, where she was to be inducted into the Detroit hall of fame along with her sisters, scheduled for 27 April. This would have been her first performance in America for over 30 years. Quatro also had to re-schedule other concert dates, whilst some were cancelled altogether","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29becb1ccdf5709451e24c3434b693b2f77db7d","amp;dn":"Suzi+Quatro+-+The+Girl+From+Detroit+City+%5B4+CD%27s%5D%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29becb1ccdf5709451e24c3434b693b2f77db7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,155,236,177,204,223,87,9,69,30,36,195,67,75,105,59,47,119,219,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
