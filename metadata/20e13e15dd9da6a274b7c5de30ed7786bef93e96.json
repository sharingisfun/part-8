So if your looking for less quality go somewhere else.  (My files are the closest to the lossless source GUARANTEED)\n\nI Stand Behind My Bitrates and Authenticity... Enjoy and Seed\n\n==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================\nBelow I will show you how to easily determine if an AAC or MP3 is truly 320 or just a re-encode...\n\nYou will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1. Open adobe audition and click on edit\n\n2. Drag and Drop (or add) the mp3/aac file into adobe audition (aac must be wav)\n\n3. Click on &quot;View&quot; and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)\n\n\nA true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..(JOINT STEREO WILL RESULT IN LOWER FREQUENCIES) (Lower Quality)\n\n128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...\n\n\nNOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!\n=================================================================================\n\nWhat is normalization?\n\nThe Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e13e15dd9da6a274b7c5de30ed7786bef93e96","amp;dn":"Death+Cab+For+Cutie++DISCOGRAPHY+AAC+%7B320kbps%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e13e15dd9da6a274b7c5de30ed7786bef93e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,225,62,21,221,157,166,162,116,183,197,222,48,237,119,134,190,249,62,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
