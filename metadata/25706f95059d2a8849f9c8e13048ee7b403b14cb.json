William Katt stars in the title role of this fictional story that relates the adventures of Charlemagne's son as he embarks on a quest to find the meaning of life and discover his true self. Ben Vereen appears in his Tony Award-winning role as the Leading Player.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippin_(musical)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippin_(musical)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPippin is a stage musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Roger O. Hirson. Bob Fosse, who directed the original Broadway production, also contributed to the libretto. The show was based on the life of Pippin the Hunchback, the son of Charlemagne. The show was partially financed by Motown Records. As of April 2009, Pippin is the 29th longest-running Broadway musical in musical theatre history.[1] Pippin was originally conceived by Stephen Schwartz as Pippin, Pippin, a student musical performed by Carnegie Mellon's Scotch'n'Soda theatre troupe.[2]\n\nAccording to musical theatre scholar Scott Miller in his 1996 book, From Assassins to West Side Story, &quot;Pippin is a largely under-appreciated musical with a great deal more substance to it than many people realize.&quot; The story is set in Charlemagne's France. Because of its 1970s pop style score and a somewhat emasculated licensed version for amateur productions which is very different from the original Broadway production, the show now has a reputation for being merely cute and harmlessly naughty; but if done the way director Bob Fosse envisioned it, the show is surreal and disturbingly truthful.&quot;\n\n1981 Video\n\nIn 1981, a stage production of Pippin was videotaped for Canadian television. It was directed by Kathryn Doby, Bob Fosse's dance captain for the original Broadway production, and directed for video by David Sheehan, with Roger O. Hirson in charge of the music. Ben Vereen returned for the role of Leading Player, while William Katt played the role of Pippin. Because of the time restrictions in television, many parts of the play were cut from the broadcast.[8]\n\nCast:\n\n* Ben Vereen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The leading player\n* William Katt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pippin\n* Leslie Denniston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Catherine\n* Benjamin Rayson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Charlemagne\n* Martha Raye ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Berthe\n* Chita Rivera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fastrada\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082909/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082909/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25706f95059d2a8849f9c8e13048ee7b403b14cb","amp;dn":"Live+On+Broadway+-+Pippin+-+Ben+Vereen+1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25706f95059d2a8849f9c8e13048ee7b403b14cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,112,111,149,5,157,42,136,73,249,200,225,48,72,238,123,64,59,20,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
