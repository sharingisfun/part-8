Sandberg (Author), Eddison C. Tatham (Author)\n\n\nPrentice Hall | 1997 | ISBN: 0133316033 | 526 pages | PDF | 52 MB\n\n\n\nreview is from: French for Reading\n\nThis is a beautifully structured book for teaching yourself to read French (not to write or speak French). It's weirdly expensive, and it needs updating, but it's great anyway. I needed to prepare for a translation exam required by my doctoral program, with a background of a year of French in the seventh grade and enough Spanish and Latin to have a feel for Romance languages. I used this book, making vocabulary flash cards along the way, and I passed my exam.\n\nA tip for choosing a French/English dictionary suitable for beginners: See if there's an entry for &quot;eu&quot; (&quot;had&quot;) that at least refers you to &quot;avoir&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;). If there isn't, find another dictionary--one that doesn't assume you know things like entirely irregular past participles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cc959b752155256eed4bb15f2e6a9f69a0c06d","amp;dn":"French+for+Reading","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cc959b752155256eed4bb15f2e6a9f69a0c06d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,204,149,155,117,33,85,37,110,237,75,177,95,46,106,159,105,160,192,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
