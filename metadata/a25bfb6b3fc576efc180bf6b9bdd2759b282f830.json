Codario, MD, details for busy primary care practitioners the state of the art in diagnosing and managing diabetes, as well as in reducing patient risk factors. Using an evidence-based approach, Dr. Codario explains, in simple clinical terms that avoid the complexity of much larger textbooks, our latest understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetes, its treatment with insulin and oral agents, and the management of its risk factors. The author also extensively reviews such major topics as the metabolic syndrome, the role of exercise and nutrition, and the key issues associated with the use of herbs and nutraceuticals. Also included are continuing medical education (CME) questions that provide the opportunity to acquire up to a maximum of 10 AMA/PRA category 1 CME credits. For the past 15 years, the author has given CME lectures on diabetes throughout the country.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 272 pages\n    * Publisher: Humana Press; 1 edition (May 15, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1588294714\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1588294715","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a25bfb6b3fc576efc180bf6b9bdd2759b282f830","amp;dn":"Type+2+Diabetes%2CPre-Diabetes%2Cand+the+Metabolic+Syndrome+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a25bfb6b3fc576efc180bf6b9bdd2759b282f830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,91,251,107,63,197,118,239,193,128,191,107,155,221,39,89,178,130,248,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
