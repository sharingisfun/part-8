So read the book first, watch the movie then read the book or don't watch the movie at all. It's your choice.\n\n\n(All the books have the same title as the corresponding movie except for All You Need is Kill, which is the inspiration for Edge of Tomorrow.)\n\n\n*Bonus book- Sharp Objects. I'm sure if you love the other two Gillian Flynn books you'd want to read her other, which is set to be made into a movie as well but a date and cast has yet to be determined.\n\n\n\nAs always enjoy and remember to please seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41643ce7d8ae036b7f1650b7e01b6e23819e562f","amp;dn":"Books+to+Movies+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41643ce7d8ae036b7f1650b7e01b6e23819e562f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,100,60,231,216,174,3,107,127,22,80,183,224,27,110,35,129,158,86,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
