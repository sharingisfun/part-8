Release: 1999. 192Kbps.\n\n\nThe Journey: Destiny's Child is the first of two box sets from Germany's Bear Family Records covering Waylon Jennings' pre-outlaw period. This set collects his complete recordings from his first Buddy Holly-produced single to his April 1968 RCA sessions. His rare, privately released album Waylon at J.D.'s is here, in addition to a number of other complete albums such as Folk-Country, Sings Ol' Harlan, and Love of the Common People. Also included are early demos, radio ads for Coca-Cola and other products, a number of previously unreleased cuts, and his complete A&amp;M recordings from the early '60s. Many of Waylon's individual '60s albums have been reissued domestically, which means that much of the music herein can be had for far less than the high retail price of this box set. For hardcore fans and completists, though, The Journey: Destiny's Child is an all-inclusive survey of Waylon's early years, and the accompanying full-color hardback book is chock full of rare photos and fascinating tidbits.
