It's quieter, cleaner and maybe even a little spiritual. It's no surprise that many &quot;plugged-in&quot; woodworkers are returning to the roots of this treasured skill. Where some hand-tool books focus solely on the use of hand tools, Made By Hand takes you right to the bench and shows you how to start building furniture using these tools.\n\nBy working through the six projects in this book, you'll learn the basics of hand-tool woodworking and how to use the tools effectively and efficiently, then add joinery skills and design complexity. The accompanying DVD includes valuable insight into the tools themselves and a look at the techniques that make these tools work so well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:889351b3ea68439d53997404af17ea55566b0982","amp;dn":"Made+by+Hand%3A+Furniture+Projects+from+the+Unplugged+Woodshop+-+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"889351b3ea68439d53997404af17ea55566b0982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,147,81,179,234,104,67,157,83,153,116,4,175,23,234,85,86,107,9,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
