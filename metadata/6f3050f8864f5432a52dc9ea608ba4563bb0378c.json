Author and musician Yeuda Ben-Atar starts this course by showing how to set up all audio, MIDI, and external plugins and prep an initial project for recording. Then he jumps into high gear: making beats with the Ableton drum kits, recording with the built-in virtual instruments, and capturing live performance like vocals and guitar. After your tracks are recorded, learn how to arrange song clips, layer in effects, create and record automation, and quickly mix the tracks with groups, busses, EQ, compression, and other techniques. The final chapter in the course shows you how to save, export, and master your finished song.\n\nTopics include:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Setting up plugins and projects\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Creating a drumbeat\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Converting audio to MIDI\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Recording vocals\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Warping and editing clips\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Adding effects\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Using time commands\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Working with the mixer\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Using side chain compression\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Adding reverb and delay\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Mixing dynamically with automation\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Mastering a song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3050f8864f5432a52dc9ea608ba4563bb0378c","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Ableton+Live+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3050f8864f5432a52dc9ea608ba4563bb0378c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,48,80,248,134,79,84,50,165,45,201,234,96,139,164,86,59,176,55,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
