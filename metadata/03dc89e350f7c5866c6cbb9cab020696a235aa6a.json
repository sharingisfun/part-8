The results are a MASCHINE Expansion that adds a carefully-crafted set of new and instantly useable sounds to your MASCHINE library.\n\nAll kits include stunning pre-programmed patterns and several full MASCHINE projects, several of which were created by Desolat recording artist and studio mastermind Martin Buttrich, also known for his work with Loco Dice and Timo Maas, among others.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInstall:\n\n1. Take the unzipped library and drop it in your Maschine directory (usually Macintosh HD /Users/Shared/).\n\n2. Open Maschine and go to preferences, library and select the expansion you just dropped into your directory. Click on it and hit RESCAN on the bottom right. It should work perfect.\n\nHINT: Intially you may have to 'find missing sample' and find some 'kick.wav' file inside the library. Do that and it should work perfectly.\n\n3. Hit that plus button.\n\n4. Enjoy!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (04).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03dc89e350f7c5866c6cbb9cab020696a235aa6a","amp;dn":"Maschine+Packs+-+Transistor+Punch+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03dc89e350f7c5866c6cbb9cab020696a235aa6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,220,137,227,80,247,197,134,108,108,187,156,171,2,6,150,162,53,170,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
