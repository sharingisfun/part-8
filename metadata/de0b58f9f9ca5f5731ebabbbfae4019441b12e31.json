Just one thing I would add; Take everywhere it says LSD and replace it with Amanita muscaria (Which was the real entheogen this manual is experientially based upon). Then you have it! Keep in mind that NONE of the world's religions tell the whole truth, and this includes Tibetan Buddhism. All Patriarcal religions have severe problems and you should know what those problems (false dogmas) are before experimenting. The discovery that this book is not necessarily a book for the dead but a book to map the consciousness of those experiencing the Shamanistic 'Death Experience' is crucial to humanity's understanding of Tibetan Buddhism and other world religion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de0b58f9f9ca5f5731ebabbbfae4019441b12e31","amp;dn":"Timothy_Leary_-_The_Psychedelic_Experience.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de0b58f9f9ca5f5731ebabbbfae4019441b12e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,11,88,249,249,202,95,87,49,235,171,187,250,228,1,148,65,177,46,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
