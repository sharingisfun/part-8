The sound is round, detailed and full, perfectly approximating live, despite being recorded in 74. Especially noteworthy is &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; which is give a spooky echo, and the two bonus tracks not previously available until recent remasterings. Despite the Surround miracle of the remastering, explained in the liner notes, you have to hear it at DVD bit rate. It's thunderingly intense and incredibly clear.&quot;\n\n&quot;In 1974, David Bowie did a six-night concert series in Philadelphia and this 5.1 surround mix by Tony Visconti is nothing short of amazing. Bowie starts with a rousing rendition of, &quot;Rebel, Rebel&quot; before jumping into an incredible version of, &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot;. All of Bowie's previous albums are represented here including the classic, &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; and the rarely sung, &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot;, a song given to Mott The Hoople. &quot;Space Oddity&quot; is a nice ethereal break in the concert halfway through and in this show version, Bowie sits in a chair on a crane that hangs over the audience. It was magic. The big live hit, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is perfectly represented here, as is, the drum-beat ridden classic, &quot;Panic In Detroit&quot;. &quot;Jean Genie&quot;is the second to last song and Bowie rides the bass line to a wholloping end. Of course, this was one of the few concerts that Bowie's end with his lamentable &quot;Rock `N Roll Suicide' and he gives it so much emotion, you feel like you are there.&quot;\n\n01 1984 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n02 Rebel Rebel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n03 Moonage Daydream Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:10\n04 Sweet Thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:48\n05 Changes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:34\n06 Suffragette City Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\n07 Aladdin Sane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:57\n08 All the Young Dudes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n09 Cracked Actor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n10 Rock 'n' Roll with Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n11 Watch That Man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:55\n12 Knock on Wood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:08\n13 Here Today, Gone Tomorrow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:32\n14 Space Oddity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:27 bonus track\n15 Diamond Dogs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:32\n16 Panic in Detroit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:41 bonus track\n17 Big Brother Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n18 Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:19\n19 The Width of a Circle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:12\n20 The Jean Genie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n21 Rock 'n' Roll Suicide Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e5b453381b25eb4ecd049a1c973388151bcf8a","amp;dn":"David+Bowie++David+Live+At+TheTower+1974+DTS+Surround","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e5b453381b25eb4ecd049a1c973388151bcf8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,229,180,83,56,27,37,235,78,205,4,154,28,151,51,136,21,27,207,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
