A\ncouple start asking themselves that very question in this dark comedy\ndirected by Danny DeVito. Alex (Ben Stiller) and Nancy (Drew Barrymore)\nare a young couple who are happy and successful, but lack one thing that\nthey truly want -- the perfect home in Manhattan. Alex and Nancy think they\nmay have found just the place they've been looking for when they discover\nthe bottom half of a beautiful old duplex has opened up. While the couple\nare delighted with their new flat, they discover it has one major disadvantage\nthey hadn't counted on -- their upstairs neighbor, Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essel)\nan elderly woman who soon makes their lives a living hell. Persuading Mrs.\nConnelly to move is fruitless, since she has a long term rent-controlled lease\nand as things become more and more difficult, Alex and Nancy begin to wonder\nif she won't go away on her own, perhaps a more drastic (and permanent)\nsolution may be in order. Duplex also stars Harvey Fierstein, Justin Theroux\nJames Remar, and Swoosie Kurtz.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Ben Stiller.\n=&gt;-Drew Barrymore.\n=&gt;-Eileen Essell.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Danny DeVito.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Drama.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2003.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.26 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 116 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 25mn.\n=&gt;-Duplex.....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/duplex/\n=&gt;-Duplex.....................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/duplex/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2000 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 134 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8488451e183e9e86a741a125d26c9a977435bd02","amp;dn":"Duplex+-+Ben+Stiller+Drew+Barrymore+Comedy+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-m","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8488451e183e9e86a741a125d26c9a977435bd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,136,69,30,24,62,158,134,167,65,161,37,210,108,154,151,116,53,189,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
