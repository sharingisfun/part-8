Or felt frustrated that an oddly shaped structure or pretty setting you wished to portray in writing didn't quite translate clearly to paper?\nIf the answer to either of these questions is yes, then The Describer's Dictionary is exactly the book you need. Open it, and you have not only just the right words butÃ¢â‚¬â€bringing them to lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€stellar literary examples of descriptive writing as well.\n\nThe Dictionary concern itself with the observable, from shapes to buildings to human beings. &quot;Referably&quot; organized, the book uses a handy reverse, definition-to-term format that makes it easy to zero in on the term you're seeking. For example, look up &quot;Noses&quot; to find &quot;aquiline,&quot; &quot;leptorrhine,&quot; and &quot;snub-nosed.&quot; And as an inspiration to any writerÃ¢â‚¬â€showing how it's done by the bestÃ¢â‚¬â€hundreds of colorful and evocative descriptive passages from such diverse authors as Dickens, Darwin, and Updike appear on facing pages, making this a singularly and richly different kind of reference book.\n\nThe craft of description lives in literature, conversation, journalism, and personal letters. For help in painting pictures with the English language, The Desciber's Dictionary is one of the most indispensable reference tools you can own.
