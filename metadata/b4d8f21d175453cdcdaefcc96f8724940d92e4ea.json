The Tenth Edition maintains the straightforward and traditional academic format that has made it the leading study skills text in the market. HOW TO STUDY IN COLLEGE provides an added focus on the three-step path to study success: to be a successful student you need to build a strong study skills foundation and then gain, retain, and explain information. Students will find it easier to gauge their progress and place their academic activity in clearer context when they think of their coursework in these terms. Based on widely tested educational and learning theories, HOW TO STUDY IN COLLEGE teaches study techniques such as visual thinking, active listening, concentration, note taking, and test taking, while also incorporating material on vocabulary building. Questions in the Margin, based on the Cornell Note Taking System, places key questions about content in the margins of the text to provide students with a means for reviewing and reciting the book's main ideas. Students then use this conceptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Q-SystemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to formulate their own questions.\n\nJanuary 2010\nPublisher: Cengage Learning\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d8f21d175453cdcdaefcc96f8724940d92e4ea","amp;dn":"How+To+Study+in+College+10th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d8f21d175453cdcdaefcc96f8724940d92e4ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,216,242,29,23,84,83,205,205,174,252,201,111,135,36,148,13,146,228,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
