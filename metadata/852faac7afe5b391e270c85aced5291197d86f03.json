The two women have not spoken since, and now their lives could not be more different. Claire is the glamorous trophy wife of an Atlanta millionaire. Lydia, a single mother, dates an ex-con and struggles to make ends meet. But neither has recovered from the horror and heartbreak of their shared lossÂ—a devastating wound that's cruelly ripped open when Claire's husband is killed.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of a teenage girl and the murder of a middle-aged man, almost a quarter-century apart: what could connect them? Forming a wary truce, the surviving sisters look to the past to find the truth, unearthing the secrets that destroyed their family all those years ago . . . and uncovering the possibility of redemption, and revenge, where they least expect it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852faac7afe5b391e270c85aced5291197d86f03","amp;dn":"Karin+Slaughter-Pretty+Girls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852faac7afe5b391e270c85aced5291197d86f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,47,170,199,175,229,179,145,226,112,200,90,206,213,41,17,151,216,111,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
