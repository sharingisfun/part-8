After simmering and stewing throughout the U.K. and Europe, the band landed boots first at the Staples Center for a rousing performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards that found the smartly dressed quartet tearing through &quot;The Cave,&quot; and then backing, along with the equally snappy Avett Brothers, Bob Dylan on a generation-spanning rendition of &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; that provided one of the better Grammy moments of the last decade or so. They may lack the lyrical prowess of &quot;The Bard,&quot; but they know how to turn a phrase, plant a seed, and build a bridge and tear it back down again without losing the audience in the process. Simply put, they can bend the relative simplicity of traditional folk music to their collective wills, which is exactly what they do on their sophomore outing, Babel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72493ba51fc8ddbace36aa7473d4282f7644421d","amp;dn":"Mumford+%26amp%3B+Sons+-+Babel+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72493ba51fc8ddbace36aa7473d4282f7644421d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,73,59,165,31,200,221,186,206,54,170,116,115,212,40,47,118,68,66,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
