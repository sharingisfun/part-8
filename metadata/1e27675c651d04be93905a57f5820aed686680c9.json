The short-lived Fox Network series hired him toward the end of its run, and he occasionally made brief appearances in the sketches. He had a speaking role in &quot;The Legend of T.J. O'Pootertoot&quot;, a sketch written almost entirely by Cross. It was during this period that he first met Bob Odenkirk, with whom he would later co-create the HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show in 1995. Cross won an Emmy for his work on The Ben Stiller Show in 1993.\n\nCross later co-starred as Tobias FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nke in Arrested Development, which was originally intended to be only a minor role. He has also played smaller roles on programs such as Just Shoot Me!, The Drew Carey Show, NewsRadio, Strangers with Candy, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Since October 2005, Cross has appeared on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report as Stephen Colbert's arch-nemesis, a fictional liberal radio talk show host from Madison, Wisconsin named &quot;Russ Lieber&quot;. Cross also developed an animated series for Comedy Central called Freak Show, which co-starred H. Jon Benjamin, and was canceled due to low ratings. He has appeared several times on the MTV2 series Wonder Showzen.\n\nCross teamed up with Odenkirk to produce a feature film, based on one of their Mr. Show characters, called Run Ronnie Run. The film satirized the reality television craze, and featured cameos from many stars. However, Cross and Odenkirk came into creative conflict with the director, Troy Miller, and after nearly two years of production, New Line Cinema sent it straight to DVD. In 1994 and again in 1999, Cross was a guest voice actor on Joe Frank's radio show, featured in the episodes &quot;The Last Run&quot;, &quot;A Hearing&quot;, &quot;The O.J. Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Jam&quot;.\n\nCross continues to perform stand-up, in which he blends left-wing[5] political commentary and satire. In 1999, he was given his own one-hour comedy special on HBO, entitled The Pride Is Back. He has released two recordings, Shut Up You Fucking Baby! and It's Not Funny. In 2004, Shut Up You Fucking Baby! was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. In 2003, he released his first tour film, Let America Laugh, and was named #85 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time. He appears on Un-Cabaret compilation albums, including Freak Weather Feels Different and The Good, the Bad and the Drugly.\n\nIn 2004, Cross provided voices for a Marine in the Xbox game Halo 2, and a store clerk named Zero in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. He also was the voice of the violent, alcoholic &quot;Happy-Time Harry&quot; doll and Bert Banana in Aqua Teen Hunger Force (although the part was credited as Sir Willups Brightslymoore). He has also made guest appearances in the Adult Swim series Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!. He directed the music video for The Black Keys' song &quot;10am Automatic&quot;, a spoof of public-access television.\n\nIn April 2005, Cross criticized stand-up comedian Larry the Cable Guy in a Rolling Stone interview, saying, &quot;It's a lot of anti-gay, racist humor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which people like in America ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ all couched in 'I'm telling it like it is.' He's in the right place at the right time for that gee-shucks, proud-to-be-a-redneck, I'm-just-a-straight-shooter-multimillionaire-in-cutoff-flannel-selling-ring-tones act. That's where we are as a nation now. We're in a state of vague American values and anti-intellectual pride.&quot; In response, Larry devoted a chapter in his book GIT-R-DONE to Cross and the &quot;P.C. left&quot;, claiming that Cross had &quot;screwed with my fans, it was time for me to say something&quot;. Cross responded with An Open Letter to Larry the Cable Guy posted on his website.[6] He continued to mock Larry in his stand-up, satirizing Blue Collar TV during a guest appearance on Wonder Showzen. In December 2005, he ended his performance on Comedy Central's Last Laugh '05 by mockingly yelling &quot;GIT-R-DONE!&quot; (Larry the Cable Guy's catch phrase) to the audience as he left the stage. He pokes fun at Larry's comedy in Freak Show with a character called &quot;Danny the Plumber Guy&quot;.\n\nCross appeared in The Strokes' music video for &quot;Juicebox&quot; as a bad local &quot;morning zoo&quot; radio DJ. He also appeared in The New Pornographers' video for &quot;Use It&quot;, in Superchunk's video for &quot;Watery Hands&quot; (along with Janeane Garofalo), and in Yo La Tengo's video for &quot;Sugarcube&quot; (along with Bob Odenkirk and John Ennis). Cross contributes to Vice magazine, writing a column titled &quot;My America&quot;.\n\nIn 2005, he contributed to the UNICEF benefit song &quot;Do They Know It's Hallowe'en?&quot;. In October 2005, he was sued by Nashville club owner Thomas Weber, who accused Cross of taping him without permission for Let America Laugh in violation of Weber's privacy rights. Weber established a website called werenotlaughing.com. In April 2006, the case against Cross himself was dismissed, leaving Weber to face Warner Music, Subpop Records, WEA Corporation, and the Alternative Distribution Alliance.\n\nIn the Beastie Boys' 2006 concert film Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!, Cross played the character Nathaniel HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnblowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©r in the fictional segment &quot;A Day in the Life of Nathaniel HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnblowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©r&quot;. In the Bob Dylan biographical film I'm Not There, Cross played the role of poet Allen Ginsberg. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence has stated that Cross may appear in the show as his Arrested Development character Tobias FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nke.\n\nCross provided commentary on the Vicarious music video DVD for the band Tool. He has previously performed comedy as an opening act for the band, and its members appeared on Mr. Show several times. He played Ian Hawke in the 2007 movie Alvin and the Chipmunks and Crane in the 2008 movie Kung Fu Panda.\n\nCross starred in a pilot for HBO called David's Situation which filmed in May 2008 and included many Mr. Show alumni at the taping. On August 6, 2008, Bob Odenkirk announced on bobanddavid.com that David's Situation would not be produced.\n\nCross' first UK-only project, The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret, was a comedy pilot for Channel 4 which he co-wrote with writer Shaun Pye. Cross' first book, I Drink For A Reason, was published in August 2009.\n\nIn September 2009 Cross performed at his own comedy stage at the ATP New York 2009 music festival, for which he picked Eugene Mirman, Jon Benjamin &amp; Jon Glaser and Derrick Brown &amp; The Navy Gravy to join him.\n\nOn March 29, 2010 Cross's first comedy special in six years &quot;Bigger and Blackerer&quot; will be streamed on EpixHD. A CD with &quot;slighly different content&quot; will be released in May 25, 2010.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e27675c651d04be93905a57f5820aed686680c9","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+David+Cross+-+Ainsley+McTree+%28Bootleg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e27675c651d04be93905a57f5820aed686680c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,39,103,92,101,29,4,190,147,144,90,87,245,130,10,237,104,102,128,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
