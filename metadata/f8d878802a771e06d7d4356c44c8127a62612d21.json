If you happen to have some of these, and you're not happy with the scan quality, do check the file sizes, if mine are bigger, chances are that they  have gone through Photoshop and are better.\n\nTo choose the files you want to download when downloading a .torrent file\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you're using Firefox it will ask you &quot;save or open&quot;. Choose Open with  uTorrent or your other client. And you'll get a window with all the files  checked. Uncheck the ones you don't want, click OK and you're done. \n\n\nTo choose the files you want to download when downloading a magnet link\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn uTorrent) go to the lower half of the window, click the &quot;Files&quot; tab, wait a  bit until the list of files appears; select those you don't want, right click and  check &quot;Don't download&quot;. Other clients also have this capability. \nHowever, if you download the whole thing and seed it, you will do a service  to other downloaders. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n--------------- \nSite statistics are not always accurate - actually, they  seldom are! For instance, you may see 0 seeders and just a few leechers,  but if you download and open in your torrent client, you may see that in fact  there are many. So don't trust the numbers you see and despair, check for  yourself before giving up. \n\nMy other torrents with knitting and crochet patterns include\n------------------------------------------------------------\nKnitting patterns - babies and children (huge collection!) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667034\nCrochet and Knitting patterns - babies and children http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667054\nCrochet patterns - babies and children http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6667066\nCrochet afghan (throw) mega collection &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022179/Crochet_afghan_%28throw%29_mega_collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022179/Crochet_afghan_%28throw%29_mega_collection&lt;/a&gt;\nCrochet bags http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7065718/Crochet_bags_patterns\nCrochet motifs http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067166\nKnit afghans http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7067277/Knit_afghans_%28throws%29__bedspreads_pattern_collection\n\nBut I'm uploading more and more, so just click my username to see them all...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d878802a771e06d7d4356c44c8127a62612d21","amp;dn":"Knit+bag+and+purse+pattern+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d878802a771e06d7d4356c44c8127a62612d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,216,120,128,42,119,30,6,215,212,53,108,68,200,18,122,98,97,45,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
