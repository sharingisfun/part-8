Alongside artist John Mcrae, Ennis took hitman and &quot;Bloodlines&quot; character Tommy Monaghan from the pages of the Demon and placed him in harm's way time and again for a rip - roaring 60 issue romp. With guest stars like Batman, Catwoman and Superman, and such new off-beat characters as Six-Pack and Dogwelder, Hitman was an enjoyable cult favorite that approached the iconic world of super heroes from a cynical and often hilarious viewpoint.\n\nTrade Paperbacks\nMore then fifteen years after its beginning, the series still hadn`t been entirely collected. DC righted this wrong, by making new editions of the old trades and reprinting previously uncollected material. Now, all of it has been collected.\n\nVol. 1: A Rage in Arkham (#1-3, The Batman Chronicles #4 and The Demon Annual #2)\nVol. 2: Ten Thousand Bullets (#4-8 and Hitman Annual)\nVol. 3: Local Heroes (#09-14)\nVol. 4: The Ace of Killers (#15-22)\nVol. 5: Tommy's Heroes (#23-36 and 1000000)\nVol. 6: For Tomorrow (#37-50)\nVol. 7: Closing Time (#51-60, Hitman/Lobo - That Stupid Bastich #1, JLA/Hitman #1-2 and a story from Superman 80-Page Giant #1)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da57b1fe3781cc5a10433972434248831ab10955","amp;dn":"Hitman+%28v1+-+v7%29+%282009+-+2012%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da57b1fe3781cc5a10433972434248831ab10955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,87,177,254,55,129,204,90,16,67,57,114,67,66,72,131,26,177,9,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
