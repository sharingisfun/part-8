Instead Walter Trout has come down with a liver disease that has caused him to spend his time in the hospital waiting for a liver transplant instead of celebrating. Recorded over the last year, The Blues Came CallinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a collection of 12 songs that collects WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts about mortality and life.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WastinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ AwayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ opens the album with his typical muscular blues rock punch and squarely deals with WalterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illness. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to give up even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost over 100 pounds due to his liver problem. Things donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t slow down from there as he transitions into the rocking political statement of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The World is GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Crazy (And so Am I).Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bottom of the RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts with a dobro line and a theme about a drowning man who comes to the realization that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not time to die and that he needs to fight for the surface. Pertinent subject matter considering what Walter has been through lately.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Take a Little TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s style Chuck Berry sound. Things pick up again with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Willie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is a contemptuous indictment about management in the music business. On Ã¢â‚¬Å“Born in The CityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Walter again lets the guitar step forward and do most of the rocking. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tight ShoesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an instrumental in the style of Freddie King.\n\nFor a while, Walter used to tour in John MayallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bluesbreakers and he was a big influence on Walter. John is who turned him on to the late great Chicago bluesman J.B. Lenoir. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WhaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an updated cover of one of LenoirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lesser known tracks and is intended as a tribute to Mayall. Mayall also guests on the album and is quite evident on two tracks in particular. John lends his organ skills on the traditional blues title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Blues Came CallinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his playing clearly starts out Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MayallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Piano Boogie.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe album closes out with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nobody Moves Me Like You Do,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a track written for his wife. Walter describes it as his gift to her. Trout offers, Ã¢â‚¬Å“To play my music for people has become even more important to me. When I think about looking out into the crowds of people and connecting with everyone on a soul level, and sharing the experience of music with them, this is what keeps me fighting to get back: My family and my music is my lifeline. These days, it means more to me than ever before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ed1e49824bb548680dd8621a6fcfd678d7ca60","amp;dn":"Walter+Trout+-+The+Blues+Came+Callin+%282014%29+%5BDVD+CD+Special+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77ed1e49824bb548680dd8621a6fcfd678d7ca60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,237,30,73,130,75,181,72,104,13,216,98,26,111,207,214,120,215,202,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
