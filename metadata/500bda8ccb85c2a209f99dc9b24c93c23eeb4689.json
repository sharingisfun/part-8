For more than a decade afterward, she endured unimaginable torture at the hand of her abductor. In 2003 Amanda Berry joined her in captivity, followed by Gina DeJesus in 2004. Their escape on May 6, 2013, made headlines around the world.\n\nBarely out of her own tumultuous childhood, Michelle was estranged from her family and fighting for custody of her young son when she disappeared. Local police believed she had run away, so they removed her from the missing persons lists fifteen months after she vanished. Castro tormented her with these facts, reminding her that no one was looking for her, that the outside world had forgotten her. But Michelle would not be broken.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:500bda8ccb85c2a209f99dc9b24c93c23eeb4689","amp;dn":"Finding+Me%3A+A+Decade+of+Darkness%2C+a+Life+Reclaimed+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"500bda8ccb85c2a209f99dc9b24c93c23eeb4689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,11,218,140,203,133,194,162,9,249,157,201,178,76,147,194,62,235,70,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
