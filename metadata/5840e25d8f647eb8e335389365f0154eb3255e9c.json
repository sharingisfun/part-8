The group dishes about the shocking allegations followed Adrienne and Paul's divorce, while Mauricio explains his passionate stance in the Brandi/Adrienne conflict. And despite three seasons of a reality show (and being sisters their whole lives), there is still anguish and tears as Kim and Kyle discuss Kim's first year of sobriety, and the difficulty Kyle has in trusting her.\n\n\nThanks to RKSTR for capping and sharing.\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5840e25d8f647eb8e335389365f0154eb3255e9c","amp;dn":"The.Real.Housewives.Of.Beverly.Hills.S03E21.HDTV.x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5840e25d8f647eb8e335389365f0154eb3255e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,64,226,93,143,100,126,184,227,53,56,147,101,240,21,78,179,37,94,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
