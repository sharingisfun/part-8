Recorded in 1960 with Kenny Burrell on guitar, Donald Bailey on drums, and Turrentine, the group reaches the peak of funky soul jazz that all other challengers of the genre would have to live up to. Included on this uptempo session is a reworking of &quot;When I Grow Too Old to Dream&quot; (a feature for Turrentine), Turrentine's &quot;Minor Chant,&quot; two Smith compositions, &quot;Messy Bessie&quot; as well as the set's notable title cut. Smith's Midnight Special album was recorded at these same sessions, and is also exceptional. [Some reissues add a bonus track, &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street.&quot;] (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Back At The Chicken Shack\n02. When I Grow Too Old To Dream\n03. Minor Chant\n04. Messy Bessie\n05. On The Sunny Side Of The Street\n\nPersonnel:\nJimmy Smith - organ\nKenny Burrell - guitar\nStanley Turrentine - tenor saxophone\nDonald Bailey - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8553c268b0586572f59f9c79b91055236282b539","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+-+1960+-+Back+At+The+Chicken+Shack+%282011+SACD+24+88.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8553c268b0586572f59f9c79b91055236282b539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,83,194,104,176,88,101,114,245,159,156,121,185,16,85,35,98,130,181,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
