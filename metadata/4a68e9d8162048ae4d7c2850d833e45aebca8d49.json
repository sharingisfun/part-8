Music was a constant in  her nomadic life. She began singing gospel in church when  she was only five and grew up listening to a variety of artists,  including Dolly Parton, John Denver, Whitney Houston and  gospel innovators BeBe and CeCe Winans. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Those were huge  influences,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says, recalling a particularly pivotal moment.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was at a Texas Rangers baseball game and LeAnn Rimes  was singing the National Anthem. This was right when she  came out with Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. I was completely mesmerized.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMickey knew instantly what she wanted to do with her life, and  although she possesses the kind of strong, evocative voice  that could succeed in any genre, Country music is her  passion. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Of all the genres that are out there, Country is the  most honest, the most genuine and speaks to my heartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she  says.\n\nMickey moved to Los Angeles after high school to attend  Santa Monica College. She worked long hours at two jobs,  struggling to make ends meet, but held on to her dream of  becoming a Country singer. A chance encounter turned  everything around. A friend introduced her to producer Julian  Raymond (Glen Campbell, the Wallflowers) who was  immediately impressed with Mickey. He began working with  the young artist and connected her to Gary Borman and his  partner Steve Moir, the company that built the careers of Faith  Hill, Keith Urban and Lady Antebellum from day one.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I sang for them and they saw potential in me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains  Mickey. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Now I have a record deal with Capitol Records, I've  sung at the White House and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m making an album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very,  very humbling because if you would have asked me a few  years ago if I would have pictured myself being at this point, I  probably would of laughed and said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœYeah right!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very  appreciative of it because I understand how hard it is for  artists to get to this point. I feel extremely blessed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Texas Native's first national television appearance was November 2011 on stage at the White House during an all-star concert that included James Taylor, Dierks Bentley, Kris Kristofferson, The Band Perry, Darius Rucker and Lyle Lovett.  The show was captured by PBS and broadcast as part of their  &quot;In Performance at the White House&quot; series. Mickey's riveting  rendition of Patsy Cline's classic &quot;Crazy&quot; was one of the  highlights of the night. \n\nMickey will release an acoustic EP, Unbreakable, in  conjunction with her iTunes Festival performance in Austin,  TX on March 15. She is currently working on her debut album  with producer Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift, Keith Urban,  Lady Antebellum).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a68e9d8162048ae4d7c2850d833e45aebca8d49","amp;dn":"Mickey+Guyton+-+Unbreakable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a68e9d8162048ae4d7c2850d833e45aebca8d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,104,233,216,22,32,72,174,77,124,40,80,216,51,228,90,235,202,141,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
