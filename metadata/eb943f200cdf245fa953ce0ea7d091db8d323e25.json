A brash, lovable immigrant businessman who built a cosmetics empire and made a fortune, heâ€™s just been ruined by the financial crisis. Now all Charles wants is to get his kids safely stowed away so that he can go to China and attempt to reclaim his familyâ€™s ancestral landsâ€”and his pride.\r\nCharles pulls Andrew, his aspiring comedian son, and Grace, his style-obsessed daughter, out of schools he can no longer afford. Together with their stepmother, Barbra, they embark on a cross-country road trip from their foreclosed Bel-Air home to the upstate New York hideout of the eldest daughter, disgraced art world it-girl Saina. But with his son waylaid by a temptress in New Orleans, his wife ready to defect for a set of 1,000-thread-count sheets, and an epic smash-up in North Carolina, Charles may have to choose between the old world and the new, between keeping his family intact and finally fulfilling his dream of starting anew in China.\r\nOutrageously funny and full of charm, The Wangs vs. the World is an entirely fresh look at what it means to belong in Americaâ€”and how going from glorious riches to (still name-brand) rags brings one family together in a way money never could.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb943f200cdf245fa953ce0ea7d091db8d323e25","amp;dn":"The+Wangs+vs.+the+World+-+Jade+Chang+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb943f200cdf245fa953ce0ea7d091db8d323e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,148,63,32,12,223,36,95,169,83,206,14,167,208,145,219,141,50,62,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
