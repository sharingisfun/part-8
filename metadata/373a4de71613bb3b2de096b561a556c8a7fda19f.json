Tested on Windows XP Home Edition and everything works; used Daemon-Tools to mount the CD Image. [Alt]+[TAB] (Multi-Tasking) doesn't work too well with the game. Installation is pretty standard. And you can play one-on-one with an AI or with a friend. TCP/IP is one way to connect in Multiplayer. Gamepads/Joysticks work with this game too. Game controls are in-game, you can find it in the Preferences section then the Controller Configuration section.  More info in the AGC-readme_(fclapd).txt file.\n\nThe Torrent comes with a NoCD crack and Glide update patch.\n\nFile size comparison between RAR and Extracted contents:\n\n478MB RAR\n743MB Extracted\n\nLinks\nÃ‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯Ã‚Â¯\nMobyGames\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/sheet/p,3/gameId,3628/\n\nElectric Playground Review (MAC version)\nhttp://www.elecplay.com/reviews_article.php?article=384\n\nGameSpot GameSpace\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/futurecoplapd/index.html\n\nArchive of Official site\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.futurecop.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373a4de71613bb3b2de096b561a556c8a7fda19f","amp;dn":"Future+Cop%3A+LAPD+%281998%29%28CloneCD+in+RAR%29%28PC%29%28by+AGCnet+tk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373a4de71613bb3b2de096b561a556c8a7fda19f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,58,77,231,22,19,187,59,45,224,150,181,97,165,86,200,167,253,161,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
