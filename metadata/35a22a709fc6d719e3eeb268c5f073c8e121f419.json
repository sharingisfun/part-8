An aborted coup in the People's Republic of China has left President Wei Zhen Lin with no choice but to agree with the expansionist policies of General Su Ke Qiang. They have declared the South China Sea a protectorate and are planning an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nThe Ryan administration is determined to thwart ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ambitions, but the stakes are dangerously high as a new breed of powerful Chinese anti-ship missile endangers the US Navy's plans to protect the island. Meanwhile, Chinese cyberwarfare experts have launched a devastating attack on American infrastructure. It's a new combat arena, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every bit as deadly as any that has gone before.\n\nJack Ryan, Jr. and his colleagues at the Campus may be just the wild card that his father needs to stack the deck. There's just one problem: someone knows about the off-the-books intelligence agency and threatens to blow their cover sky high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35a22a709fc6d719e3eeb268c5f073c8e121f419","amp;dn":"Tom+Clancy+Threat+Vector+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35a22a709fc6d719e3eeb268c5f073c8e121f419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,162,42,112,159,198,215,25,227,238,178,104,197,240,115,200,225,33,244,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
