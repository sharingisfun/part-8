For this short recording, he teams up with third-stream pianist Ran Blake in a series of 12 emotionally drenched tunes emphasizing the kind of dark, foreboding atmosphere for which Blake is well-known. Highlights include wonderful interpretations of &quot;Tea for Two,&quot; &quot;I Should Care,&quot; &quot;Let's Stay Together,&quot; a pairing of &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Laura,&quot; and &quot;Nature Boy.&quot; Rava does his best to adapt his usually brighter playing to the overall noir atmosphere, and he generally succeeds, making this a must-have for followers of both Blake's and Rava's work. A strong lyrical element permeates, as the two explore all of the nooks and crannies of each tune, often in slow motion. The results speak for themselves, and the enthusiastic live audience was clearly touched. ~ Steven Loewy, All Music Guide \n\nPersonnel:\nRan Blake (Piano),\nRan Blake (Liner Notes),\nEnrico Rava (Trumpet),\nEnrico Rava (Flugelhorn),\nEnrico Rava (Main Performer),\nFranz Koglmann (Artist Direction),\nGordon Friedrich (Engineer),\nJutta Obenhuber (Cover Art),\nFuhrer Vienna (Graphic Design)\n\nEnrico Rava - Duo en Noir Tracks:\n01  Nature Boy\n02  Vertigo / Laura Bernard Herrmann\n03  The Spiral Staircase\n04  Shake the Cage\n05  Certi Angoli\n06  There's No You\n07  Let's Stay Together\n08  I Should Care\n09  Tea for Two\n10  There's a Small Hotel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4669899b37e1126967ebbc7509488bc5c58927dc","amp;dn":"Enrico+Rava+-+Duo+en+Noir+%282000%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4669899b37e1126967ebbc7509488bc5c58927dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,105,137,155,55,225,18,105,103,235,188,117,9,72,139,197,197,137,39,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
