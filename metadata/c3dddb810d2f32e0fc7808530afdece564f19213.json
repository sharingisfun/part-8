''Pulling no punches'' (LA Daily News), Jon Favreau (Swingers) and Oscar winner George C. Scott give TKO performances in this outstanding biography of the only undefeated world heavyweight champion in the history of boxing!\n\nIn the small blue-collar town of Brockton, Massachusetts, young Rocky Marciano (Favreau) turns to the ring as his ticket out. Training twice as hard and twice as long as anyone else, he pounds his way to victory and his reputation quickly spreads as ''the guy to beat.'' But behind the gloves Rocky is unhappy with his gift and he's thinking of retiring. So, with the fate of his career hanging in the balance, he finds a way to unleash his thunder again - this time against his biggest hero - Joe Louise!\n\nMPAA RATING: Rated R for language.\n\nRETAIL RELEASE DATE: 15th May 1999.\n\nMAIN MOVIE: Video = Full Screen [Untouched].\n            Audio = English &amp; Spanish: Stereo Surround.\n            Subs = English, French &amp; Spanish Language Subtitles.\n\nMENU: Yes [Untouched].\n\nEXTRAS/SPECIAL FEATURES: Yes [Untouched].\n\nImage created with IMGBURN.\n\nSOURCE: R1 Retail DVD.\nDISC FORMAT: DVD 5.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3dddb810d2f32e0fc7808530afdece564f19213","amp;dn":"Rocky+Marciano+1999+NTSC+DVDR+Doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3dddb810d2f32e0fc7808530afdece564f19213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,221,219,129,13,47,50,224,252,120,8,83,10,253,236,229,100,241,146,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
