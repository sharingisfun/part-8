Sonia Faleiro was a reporter in search of a story when she met nineteen-year-old Leela, a charismatic exotic dancer with a story to tell. Leela introduced Sonia to the underworld of BombayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance bars: a world of glamorous women; of fierce love, sex, and violence; of gangsters, police, prostitutes, and pimps. When an ambitious politician cashed in on a tide of false morality and had BombayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance bars wiped out, LeelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proud independence faced its greatest test. In a city where almost everyone is certain that someone, somewhere, is worse off than them, she fights to surviveÃ¢â‚¬â€and to win. Sonia Faleiro has crafted one of the most original works of nonfiction about India in years. Unforgettable for its artistry and intimacy, Beautiful Thing is a vivid portrait of one reporterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey into the dark, damaged soul of Bombay. \n\nAbout The Author: \nSonia Faleiro is the author of the novel, The Girl (Viking, 2006), and is a contributing editor at Vogue . She was born in Goa, studied in Edinburgh, and lives in San Francisco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:361dadcacf8d691ab485b8b488d6c18ff6b10c88","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Thing%3A+Inside+the+Secret+World+of+Bombay%27s+Dance+Bars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"361dadcacf8d691ab485b8b488d6c18ff6b10c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,29,173,202,207,141,105,26,180,133,184,180,136,214,193,143,246,177,12,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
