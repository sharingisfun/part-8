But uncover he does, and the result is an unexpected book of both solace and humor. Dividing his work into six sections -- each highlighting a different psychic ailment and the appropriate philosopher -- de Botton offers consolation for unpopularity from Socrates, for not having enough money from Epicurus, for frustration from Seneca, for inadequacy from Montaigne, and for a broken heart from Schopenhauer (the darkest of thinkers and yet, paradoxically, the most cheering). Consolation for envy -- and, of course, the final word on consolation -- comes from Nietzsche: &quot;Not everything which makes us feel better is good for us.&quot;\n\nThis wonderfully engaging book will, however, make us feel better in a good way, with equal measures of wit and wisdom.\n\n\nBy Alain de Botton\nPublished by Knopf in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67447927b7e0cc84f023cdffdb5698323cb7ba2e","amp;dn":"The+Consolations+of+Philosophy+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67447927b7e0cc84f023cdffdb5698323cb7ba2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,68,121,39,183,224,204,132,240,35,205,255,219,86,152,50,60,183,186,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
