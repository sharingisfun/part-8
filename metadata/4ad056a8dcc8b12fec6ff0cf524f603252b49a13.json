This smash-hit show was recorded live at The Salford Lowry. \n\nExperience the critically acclaimed comedian at his best, live on stage. Stung by his mother's suggestion that he is 'not normal' Greg puts everyone under the microscope in a petty quest to discover if anyone actually is. The analysis is far from scientific and the conclusions, at best, spurious. To be clear, as an educational tool this show is worthless. It is funny though.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœA joyous celebration of our shared idiocy and a snook cocked at self-importance'--The Guardian ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ad056a8dcc8b12fec6ff0cf524f603252b49a13","amp;dn":"Greg+Davies+Live+2013+The+Back+Of+My+Mums+Head+DVDRip+XviD-Pong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ad056a8dcc8b12fec6ff0cf524f603252b49a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,208,86,168,220,200,177,47,236,111,240,207,82,79,96,50,82,180,154,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
