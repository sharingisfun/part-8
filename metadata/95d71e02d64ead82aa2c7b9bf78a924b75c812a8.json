The primary lineup consisted of guitarist Pete Townshend, vocalist Roger Daltrey, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They became known for energetic live performances.[1][2] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, their first year of eligibility.[3][4] According to the New York Times, The Who have sold 100 million records.[5]\n\nThe Who rose to fame in the United Kingdom with a pioneering instrument destruction stage show and a series of top ten hit singles (including &quot;My Generation&quot;) and top five albums, beginning in 1965 with &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;. They hit the top ten in the U.S. in 1967 with &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;. The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of top five albums in the U.S., followed by Live at Leeds (1970), Who's Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), and Who Are You (1978).\n\nMoon died in 1978, after which the band released two studio albums, the top five Face Dances (1981) and the top ten It's Hard (1982), with drummer Kenney Jones, before disbanding in 1983. They re-formed at events such as Live Aid and for reunion tours such as their 25th anniversary tour (1989) and the Quadrophenia tours of 1996 and 1997. In 2000, the three surviving original members discussed recording an album of new material. The plans were delayed by the death of Entwistle in 2002. Townshend and Daltrey continue to perform as The Who. In 2006 they released the studio album Endless Wire, which reached the top ten in the UK and U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best of The Who 1999 (20th Century Masters)\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nMy Generation\nHappy Jack\nI Can See for Miles\nMagic Bus\nPinball Wizard\nSqueeze Box\nBehind Blue Eyes\nWho Are You\nJoin Together\nWonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Get Fooled Again\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95d71e02d64ead82aa2c7b9bf78a924b75c812a8","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Best+of+1999+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95d71e02d64ead82aa2c7b9bf78a924b75c812a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,215,30,2,214,78,173,130,170,44,123,155,247,138,146,75,117,200,18,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
