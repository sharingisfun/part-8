(1968) is a science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick. It contains two interlinking plots: the main plot follows Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter of androids, while the secondary plot follows John Isidore, a man of sub-normal intelligence who befriends some of the androids.\n\nThe novel explores a number of philosophical issues including what it is to be human. By introducing organic and realistically humanoid androids in this novel, Dick asks what qualities, if any, are unique to or are able to define what is human.\n\nIn 1982, Hampton Fancher and David Peoples' loose cinematic adaptation became the film Blade Runner. The international success of Blade Runner [1] helped bring Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and its author into the public eye. For that reason, after 1982 some editions of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? were branded with the title Blade Runner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64348668edb86045839e49c0a94ff45ecd31c096","amp;dn":"Philip+K.+Dick+-+Do+Androids+Dream+of+Electric+Sheep%3F++%281968%29+--","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64348668edb86045839e49c0a94ff45ecd31c096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,52,134,104,237,184,96,69,131,158,73,192,169,79,244,94,205,49,192,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
