He had to trap and build and grow things, using his calloused hands and valuable knowledge passed down through the generations. For most men today, these once-cherished skills are as dead as the dodo. But take heart! Now guys can reconnect with those less-complicated times, rediscover how to embrace adventure, and appreciate the outdoor life. Denis Boyles, principal author of A Man's Life, has culled a wealth of essential, nearly lost manly endeavors from U.S. government pamphlets, century-old publications, and ancient scouting manuals to help re-educate us in the fine macho arts of:\n\n* Tracking a bobcat \n* Splicing a rope \n* Rescuing someone from drowning \n* Sending a smoke signal \n* Building a log cabin \nAnd much, much, much moreÃ¢â‚¬â€including, of course, how to catch a pig!\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/0419/7ad1d42.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/0419/7ad1d42.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8b9fdb3595ead928bc041986abceff06a91dfe","amp;dn":"How+to+Catch+a+Pig-+Lots+of+Cool+Stuff+Guys+Used+to+Know+but+For","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d8b9fdb3595ead928bc041986abceff06a91dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,139,159,219,53,149,234,217,40,188,4,25,134,171,206,255,6,169,29,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
