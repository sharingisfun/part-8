While his more vocal rivals sometimes grabbed the headlines, Pete always preferred to let his racket do the talking.\n\n Until now.\n\n In A ChampionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mind, the tennis great who so often exhibited visible discomfort with letting people Ã¢â‚¬Å“inside his headÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finally opens up. An athletic prodigy, Pete resolved from his earliest playing days never to let anything get in the way of his love for the game. But while this single-minded determination led to tennis domination, success didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come without a price. The constant pressure of competing on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest stageÃ¢â‚¬â€in the unblinking eye of a media machine hungry for more than mere athletic greatnessÃ¢â‚¬â€took its toll. \n\n Here for the first time Pete speaks freely about what it was like to possess what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Gift.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He writes about the personal trials he facedÃ¢â‚¬â€including the death of a longtime coach and confidantÃ¢â‚¬â€and the struggles he gutted his way through while being seemingly on top of the world. Among the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most riveting scenes are an early devastating loss to Stefan Edberg that led Pete to make a monastic commitment to delivering on his natural talent; a grueling, four-hour-plus match against Alex Corretja during which Pete became seriously ill; fierce on-court battles with rival and friend Andre Agassi; and the triumphant last match of PeteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career at the finals of the 2002 U.S. Open.\n\n In A ChampionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mind, one of the most revered, successful, and intensely private players in the history of tennis offers an intimate look at the life of an elite athlete.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eaca44339ac837e526ef0385effee700bafc05c","amp;dn":"A+Champion%27s+Mind+-+Lessons+from+a+Life+in+Tennis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eaca44339ac837e526ef0385effee700bafc05c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,172,164,67,57,172,131,126,82,110,240,56,94,255,238,112,11,175,192,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
