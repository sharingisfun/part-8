Those, and others like &quot;Castles In The Air&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Baby&quot; and Crossroads&quot; show just what a majestic songwriter he is, whilst at the same time other tracks, notably &quot;Everyday&quot; and Roy Orbison's &quot;Crying&quot; demonstrate that he interprets other people's material wonderfully.
