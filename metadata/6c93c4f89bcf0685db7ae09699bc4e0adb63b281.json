Its title isn't casual: These are elliptical meditations on the ravages of time, as preoccupied with matters of the spirit as affairs of the heart. &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; opens the song cycle with allusions to the traumatic death of toddler son Conor (the inspiration for '92's poignant &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot;), while the title song adopts the fevered, falsetto vocal style of Curtis Mayfield to riveting effect. Coproducer Simon Climie sculpts electronic orchestrations and favors clipped synth rhythms, while Clapton himself largely eschews his once dominant, climactic electric solos for restrained but potent acoustic filigree, staccato riffs, and fluid rhythm work, letting loose with a rougher, more biting edge on the squalling &quot;She's Gone.&quot; --Sam Surtherland","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c93c4f89bcf0685db7ae09699bc4e0adb63b281","amp;dn":"%281998%29+Eric+Clapton+-+Pilgrim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c93c4f89bcf0685db7ae09699bc4e0adb63b281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,147,196,248,155,207,6,133,219,122,224,150,153,188,78,10,219,99,178,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
