Africa! Revolution! also known as Cuba, an African Odyssey is a French produced documentary series (English version). This is presented by Storyville, which is a documentary strand presented by the BBC showcasing the best in international documentaries. This was broadcast on BBC4. This is part 2 of a two part documentary about Cuban intervention in Africa from the 1960s onwards.\n\nFrom Che Guevara's military campaign to avenge Lumumba in the Congo up to the fall of apartheid in South Africa, 300,000 Cubans fought alongside African revolutionaries. CUBA, AN AFRICAN ODYSSEY is the previously untold story of Cuba's support for African revolutions, one of the Cold War's most vigorous contests over resources and ideology.\n\nBehind the so-called Cold War, four adversaries with conflicting interests face off in the African continent: the Soviets want to expand their influence; the United States intend to appropriate the continent's natural riches; the former empires seek to revive their shaky colonial power; and the young nations defend their newly-won independence, armed with an ideal: internationalism. African revolutionaries like Patrice Lumumba, AmÃƒÂ­lcar Cabral and Agostinho Neto call on Cuban guerrillas to help them in their struggle. Cuba will play a central role on the continent. From Che Guevara's tragicomic epic in the Congo up to the triumph of the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale in Angola, this film tells the story of the internationalists whose saga is at the basis of today's word: they won all the battles, but end up losing the war.\n\nDirector: Jihan El-Tahri","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8067bded16d060ede415ec81f46ab2ebc79843a6","amp;dn":"Cuba+Africa+Revolution+%28Cuba+An+African+Odyssey%29+Part+2%2F2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8067bded16d060ede415ec81f46ab2ebc79843a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,103,189,237,22,208,96,237,228,21,236,129,244,106,178,235,199,152,67,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
