This would be brainwave activity as slow as one quarter cycle per second, one frequency per 10 seconds, per one minute, or even longer. Indications of ultra-slow frequencies are evident on the EEG traces of certain patients experiencing extraordinary states of consciousness. These states seem to be associated with very high states of meditation, ecstatic states of consciousness, high-level inspiration states, spiritual insight and out-of-body experiences. Some of the higher Yogic states of suspended animation associated with deepest Delta brain states actually continue deeper into these below-Delta brainwave states, which Dr. Jeffrey Thompson named the Epsilon State, Epsilon, since it is the next Greek letter of the alphabet after Delta.\n\nIn order to explore these deeper extraordinary states of consciousness associated with Epsilon brainwave patterns, Dr. Thompson had to use traditional EEG equipment in unique ways and to initiate the design of specialized EEG equipment to measure frequencies this slow. Most regular EEG equipment is not set up to measure frequencies below 0.5 Hz.\n\nIn exploring the Epsilon brainwave state, Dr. Thompson saw what seemed like a circular link between two extremes of brainwave activity and states of consciousness represented. They appeared to be associated with the type of extraordinary states of consciousness found in the highest states of meditation, deepest levels of insight, personal original creative problem solving and high degrees of Self-awareness. Dr. Thompson surmised that these extremely slow Epsilon brainwave patterns might have extremely fast HyperGamma/Lambda brainwave patterns modulating within them - just as the HyperGamma/Lambda brainwave patterns seem to quot;ridequot; on the super slow Epsilon modulation.\n\nOffered to persons since the late 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, the Epsilon brainwave state is a very special state. Use of this fantastic Audio Program, which is capable of pacing brainwaves to this special state of consciousness, will be most beneficial if used with reverence and for the purpose for which it is offered.\n\n60 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and AccurateRip verified.
