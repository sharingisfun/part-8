But on closer inspection, Rhino's Best of the Monkees is a superior set, improving on the label's 20-track Greatest Hits released in the mid-'90s. Two songs recorded during the MTV reunion during the '80s -- &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; and &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; -- have been deleted, making room for excellent heyday material: &quot;What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round?,&quot; &quot;Your Auntie Grizelda,&quot; &quot;Papa Gene's Blues,&quot; &quot;She,&quot; and &quot;Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow).&quot; Keeping in line with Rhino's infinite care pertaining to Monkees reissues, this collection has informative liner notes, lots of pictures, and a bonus five-song karaoke disc that's a lot of fun as well. \n\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD {Rhino R2 73875}\nYear.................: 2003\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.(Theme From) The Monkees\n02.Last Train To Clarksville\n03.I Wanna Be Free\n04.Papa Gene's Blues\n05.I'm A Believer\n06.(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\n07.She\n08.Mary, Mary\n09.Your Auntie Grizelda\n10.Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)\n11.Sometime In The Morning\n12.A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\n13.The Girl I Knew Somewhere\n14.Shades Of Gray\n15.Randy Scouse Git\n16.For Pete's Sake\n17.You Just May Be The One\n18.Pleasant Valley Sunday\n19.Words\n20.Daydream Believer\n21.Goin' Down\n22.What Am I Doing Hangin' 'Round\n23.Valleri\n24.Porpoise Song (Theme From ''Head'')\n25.Listen To The Band\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c3e3982ebf3ec2fe57b2a4919e201ff144ed4c","amp;dn":"Best+Of+The+Monkees+%282003%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c3e3982ebf3ec2fe57b2a4919e201ff144ed4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,195,227,152,46,191,62,194,254,87,178,164,145,158,32,31,241,68,237,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
