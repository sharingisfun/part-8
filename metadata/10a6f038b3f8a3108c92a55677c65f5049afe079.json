While he has recorded some terrible albums, and he would admit that freely, Stewart was once rock &amp; roll's best interpretive singer as well as an accomplished songwriter, creating a raw combination of folk, rock, blues, and country that sounded like no other folk-rock or country-rock material. Instead of finding the folk in rock, he found how folk rocked like hell on its own. After Stewart became successful, he began to lose the rootsier elements of his music, yet he remained a superb singer, even as he abandoned his own artistic path in favor of following pop trends. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info\n\n\n01.Long Ago And Far Away\n02.Someone To Watch Over Me\n03.They Can't Take That Away From Me\n04.Beyond The Sea\n05.You'll Never Know\n06.Time After Time\n07.I Can't Get Started\n08.The Way You Look Tonight\n09.Bye Bye Blackbird\n10.These Foolish Things\n11.But Not For Me\n12.What A Wonderful World\n13.My Foolish Heart\n14.I'll Be Seeing You\n15.I Wish You Love (Feat.
