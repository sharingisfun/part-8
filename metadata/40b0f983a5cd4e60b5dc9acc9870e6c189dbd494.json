A longing for some good British band music led me to give Pulse a shot and boy was I surprised. I'd always thought their songs that I heard on pop radio were sort of 'down' because of the lyrics. Yes, there are negative themes here, but there are an equal number of passages where the minor keys are resolved into beautiful, shining majors. Gilmour is a stupendous, versatile guitar player. I have to rate him as one of the best lead guitarists I've ever heard -- intelligent work that doesn't rely on cliches that are repeated over and over (Ever take a close listen to Clapton, even going back to the original Layla? I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about him. He's smooth, but not really very inventive -- and he plays off pitch, as well!). These two CD's will satisfy anyone thirsting for guitar elevated to an art form.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Shine on you crazy diamond                           [13:35]\n02.Astronomy domine                                     [04:21]\n03.What do you want from me                             [04:09]\n04.Learning to fly                                      [05:16]\n05.Keep talking                                         [06:53]\n06.Coming back to life                                  [06:56]\n07.Hey you                                              [04:39]\n08.A great day for freedom                              [04:30]\n09.Sorrow                                               [10:49]\n10.High hopes                                           [07:52]\n11.Another brick in the wall (part two)                 [07:08]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.Speak to me                                          [02:30]\n02.Breathe                                              [02:34]\n03.On the run                                           [03:48]\n04.Time                                                 [06:47]\n05.The great gig in the sky                             [05:52]\n06.Money                                                [08:54]\n07.Us and them                                          [06:58]\n08.Any colour you like                                  [03:21]\n09.Brain damage                                         [03:46]\n10.Eclipse                                              [02:38]\n11.Wish you were here                                   [06:35]\n12.Comfortably numb                                     [09:29]\n13.Run like hell                                        [08:37]\n____\n                      147:57 min\n213,5 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
