The Bartok's pieces exist on other editions at Sony, so not rare nor unique. However, the Poeme de l'Extase by Scriabin is a first release! It is an absolutely glorious rendition of Scriabin mystical and sensual masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, the Bartok's are also beautiful, but I think the real star of this box is Scriabin's.\r\n\r\n- Tracks :\r\n\r\nDisc One \t\r\n1 \t[Bartok] The Wooden Prince, Op. 13 (Sz 60) \t\r\n\r\nDisc Two \t\r\n2 \t[Bartok] Music For Strings, Percussion And Celesta (Sz 106) \t\r\n3 \t[Bartok] Dance Suite (Sz 77) \t\r\n4 \t[Scriabin] Le Poeme De L'Extase, Op. 54\r\n\r\n///.....................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Caudheur's Classical Catalog (CCC)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty decent collection of classical music, encoded in lossless format (FLAC).\r\n\r\nI will start to upload as much as I can, because I believe great works of art should be shared for all mankind  :)\r\n\r\nI also take requests, and remarks to improve my torrents (it's my first time creating torrents)!\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish you a pleasant listening, and don't forget to seed so that Music lives on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df198dc54a917e5562f4d007a7ae8b5c57cf5e5a","amp;dn":"Scriabin-Poeme+De+L%27Extase%3BBartok-Orchestral+Works-Boulez+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df198dc54a917e5562f4d007a7ae8b5c57cf5e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,25,141,197,74,145,126,85,98,244,208,7,167,174,139,92,87,207,94,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
