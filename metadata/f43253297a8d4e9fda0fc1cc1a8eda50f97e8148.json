NOthing!\n\n\n          Hammerfight is about 2D battles of flying machines equipped with\n          various slashing, piercing and blunt weaponry.                  \n\n          A unique combat system is based on realistic physics simulation,\n          and it ties the movements of the rider to the  movements of your\n          mouse.  As you wave the mouse,  your rider swings his warhammer,\n          smashing the foe into the wall!                                 \n\n          This creates an unequaled feel of the real strike, a feel of the\n          mass of the  weapon in your hands.  Simulated physics and direct\n          mouse  control  creates  a  huge  variety  of  possible   battle\n          techniques and an unlimited field for perfecting one's  fighting\n          skill.                                                          \n\n\n          Features :                                                      \n\n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  Intuitive mouse control.                                      \n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  Realistic physics, breakable objects.                         \n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  Great storyline.                                              \n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  High quality art.                                             \n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  More that 50 weapons.                                         \n          ÃƒÅ½Ã…Â  3 additional modes, up to 4 players.                          \n\n\n\n          If you like the game, support the developers and buy it!\n\n\n\n          1.
