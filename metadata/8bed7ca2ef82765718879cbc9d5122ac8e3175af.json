Meanwhile, Spider Pig's waste has filled up a silo in just 2 days, apparently with Homer's help. Homer can't get to the dump quickly so dumps the silo in the lake, polluting it. Russ Cargill, the villainous boss of the EPA, gives Arnold Schwarzenegger 5 options, forcing him to choose 4 (which is, unfortunately, to destroy Springfield) and putting a dome over Springfield to prevent evacuation. Homer, however, has escaped, along with his family. Can he stop the evil Cargill from annihilating his home town, and his family, who have been forced to return to Springfield?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bed7ca2ef82765718879cbc9d5122ac8e3175af","amp;dn":"The+Simpsons+Movie+-+Norsk+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bed7ca2ef82765718879cbc9d5122ac8e3175af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,237,124,162,239,130,118,87,24,135,156,188,157,81,34,172,142,49,117,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
