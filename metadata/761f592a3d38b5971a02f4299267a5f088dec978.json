Maybe it was the contrast between the voices of Iago and Othello, played by Hugh Quarshie, that made this such a memorable production. Get that right and everything else falls into place.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nCAST:\n\nHugh Quarshie (Othello)\nJuliet Aubrey (Desdemona)\nArt Malik (Iago)\n&amp; etc.\n\nDirected by David Hitchinson\n\nFirst broadcast in two parts in 2004 on the BBC World Service, but I'm unable to ascertain the exact dates.\n\n\n\nType: mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate: 160 kbps\nMode: stereo\nFrequency: 44.100 kHz\nLength: 1 hr, 55 mins (Split into 2 files)\nEncoder: Unknown\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:761f592a3d38b5971a02f4299267a5f088dec978","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+Othello++%28BBC+Radio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"761f592a3d38b5971a02f4299267a5f088dec978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,31,89,42,61,56,181,151,26,2,244,41,146,103,165,240,136,222,201,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
