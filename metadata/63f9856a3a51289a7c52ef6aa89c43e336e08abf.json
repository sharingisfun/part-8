It is a classic samurai tale. There is clan politics, samurai, ronin, seedy gambling houses, ninja, the whole enchilada. There is a ton of humor throughout, and some of the comedy are anachronisms, things that do not belong in 17th century Japan. The soundtrack is modern. The language is spoken Japanese. The subtitles are hard subbed in English. The quality of the conversion is DVDRip. The audio is 2 channel stereo which is all that's available on the dvd itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63f9856a3a51289a7c52ef6aa89c43e336e08abf","amp;dn":"Samurai+Fiction+%281998%29+DVDRip+x264+subbed+-+Diskreet.m4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63f9856a3a51289a7c52ef6aa89c43e336e08abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,249,133,106,58,81,40,154,124,82,239,106,168,156,67,227,54,224,138,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
