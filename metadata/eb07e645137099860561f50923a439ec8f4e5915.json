Hmm, wonder how that will work.\n\nThis was done even quicker than Temple of the Dog which took about four weeks... With Mad Season we just went in and started jamming on tunes and everybody had ideas and it just happened with three or four days.&quot;\n\nMcCready said, &quot;I told [Staley]... 'You do what you want, you write all the songs and lyrics. You're the singer.' He'd come in, and he'd do these beautiful songs.&quot; During the making of the album, Staley read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran.\n Martin said, &quot;Layne Staley felt as though he was on a spiritual mission through his music. Not a rock mission, a spiritual mission\n\nStaley is credited for writing all the lyrics on the original release within the liner notes of the 2013 deluxe issue. \nAs was the case with much of his work with Alice in Chains, Staley's lyrics dealt with his struggle against addiction as well as other personal troubles. Lyrically, much of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; was inspired by Khalil Gibran's The Prophet. \nVocalist Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees contributes guest vocals on &quot;I'm Above&quot; and &quot;Long Gone Day&quot;; he is also credited for co-writing the music to those tracks along with McCready and Martin. \n\nLanegan also wrote the lyrics for the three bonus tracks on Disc 1 of the deluxe issue - &quot;Locomotive&quot;, &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot;, and &quot;Slip Away&quot;. \nR.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck is credited for co-writing the music to &quot;Black Book of Fear&quot; along with McCready, Martin, Saunders, and Lanegan\nThe album's gloomy, black and white cover art was illustrated by Staley. The drawing was based upon a photograph of Staley and his then-girlfriend, Demri Lara Parrott. The album's title comes from the song &quot;I'm Above&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll lyrics by Layne Staley, except where noted.
