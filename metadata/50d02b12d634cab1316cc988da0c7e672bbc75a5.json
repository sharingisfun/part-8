Leary series) is a sequence of stand-alone science fiction novels by David Drake. They center around Daniel Leary, an officer in the Republic of Cinnabar Navy (RCN), and Adele Mundy, a librarian and spy. Drake has described it as &quot;an SF version of the Aubrey/Maturin series&quot; by Patrick O'Brian. In contrast to the hardcore military SF bent of Drake's Hammer's Slammers series, these novels are more character driven and feature political intrigue as well as battles.\n\nThe plots of the novels are based on historical incidents, often from Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. The prologue of each book includes details of its historical basis.\n\n\n1 - With the Lightnings \n2 - Lt.
