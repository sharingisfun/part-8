(Fraunhofer CBR 32 kbit/s 22050 Hz Mono, jetAudio 6.2+).\n\n\nThis is the sixteenth book in Terry Pratchett's series on the Discworld - a flat world, supported on the backs of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle. Anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does.\nIn this book, Death (capital &quot;D&quot;, he's the man, or rather the anthropomorphic personification) disappears, and his granddaughter (that's another story) is forced to pick up the family business. But, there's something very strange going on here. A young man who was supposed to die has been strangely saved by music, and the music now owns him. It has all happened before, somewhere else, but now it has come to the Discworld - sex and drugs and Music With Rocks In!\n\nThis is one of Terry Pratchett's masterpieces, and that is really saying something. I like all of the Discworld books, but several are special, like this one. This is a great book, laugh-out-loud funny with lots of great references to rock music and movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd167f9dd832b9f28b24fc0e498bf0bf52334024","amp;dn":"Soul+Music+-+Terry+Pratchett++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd167f9dd832b9f28b24fc0e498bf0bf52334024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,22,127,157,216,50,185,242,139,36,252,14,73,139,240,191,82,51,64,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
