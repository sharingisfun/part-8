The doctor-recommended massage therapy seems like a necessary step toward returning to the cockpit, but when his too-hot-to-handle neighbor, Chloe Kincaid, turns out to be his masseuse, he strays from the straight and narrow in a major way.\n\nChloe Kincaid is looking for a simple, no strings attached, ego-boosting hook up. But when her positively panty-melting neighbor, USMC Major Michael McCade, (aka Major Hottie), shows up on her massage table, she lets desire get the better of professionalism. Now theyre pretending to be engaged to avoid a whole lot of unanticipated consequences of a momentary lapse in judgment. But can a girl who avoids attachments at all costs fake an engagement to a straight-arrow soldier without falling hard?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09c6807944d9986f1200bcfb7398f62453dfbf6d","amp;dn":"Falling+for+the+Marine+%28A+McCad+-+Beck%2C+Samanthe.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09c6807944d9986f1200bcfb7398f62453dfbf6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,198,128,121,68,217,152,111,18,0,188,251,115,152,246,36,83,223,191,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
