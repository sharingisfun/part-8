While not referred to as a philosopher by his contemporaries, his status as such is now a topic of debate. He is known for writing about the history of his own times, the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC, especially for his account of the final years of the Peloponnesian War. His Hellenica, which recounts these times, is considered to be the continuation of ThucydidesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ History of the Peloponnesian War. His youthful participation in the failed campaign of Cyrus the Younger to claim the Persian throne inspired him to write about the Persian empire and its history.\n\nDespite his birth-association with Athens, Xenophon affiliated himself with Sparta for most of his life. His pro-oligarchic views, service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and beyond, as well as his friendship with King Agesilaus II endeared Xenophon to the Spartans, and them to him. A number of his writings display his pro-Spartan bias and admiration, especially Agesilaus and Constitution of Sparta. Other than Plato, Xenophon is the foremost authority on Socrates, having learned under the great philosopher while a young man. He greatly admired his teacher, and well after SocratesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ death in 399 Xenophon wrote several Socratic dialogues, including an Apology concerning the events of his trial and death. XenophonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works cover a wide range of genres and are written in very uncomplicated Attic Greek. XenophonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works are among the first that many students of Ancient Greek translate on account of the straightforward and succinct nature of his prose. This sentiment was apparent even in ancient times, as Diogenes Laertius states in his Lives of Eminent Philosophers that Xenophon was sometimes known as the &quot;Attic Muse&quot; for the sweetness of his diction.\n\nXenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by Leo Strauss, who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by Shaftesbury, Winckelmann, Machiavelli and John Adams.\n\nXenophonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value. Jennifer OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Flannery holds that 'discussions of leadership and civic virtue should include the work of Xenophon....on public education for public service.' The Cyropaedia, in outlining Cyrus as an ideal leader having mastered the qualities of Ã¢â‚¬Å“education, equality, consensus, justice and service to state,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the work that she suggests be used as a guide or example for those striving to be leaders. The linking of moral code and education is an especially pertinent quality subscribed to Cyrus that OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Flannery believes is in line with modern perceptions of leadership.\n\nThe torrent contains all the following books in ePUB and Mobi formats:\n\n*  Agesilaus\n\n*  Anabasis\n\n*  Cyropaedia - the education of Cyrus\n\n*  Hellenica\n\n*  Hiero\n\n*  Hiero the Tyrant and Other Treatises\n\n*  On Horsemanship\n\n*  On Revenues\n\n*  Polity Athenians and Lacedaemonians\n\n*  The Apology\n\n*  The Cavalry General\n\n*  The Economist\n\n*  The Expedition of Cyrus\n\n*  The Memorabilia\n\n*  The Memorable Thoughts of Socrates\n\n*  The Sportsman\n\n*  The Symposium\n\n\nRead the following article, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1641fa0f543f648d0ddfa61919ea94ed2bea9a22","amp;dn":"Xenophon+-++Greek+historian+and+philosopher+%2817+Books%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1641fa0f543f648d0ddfa61919ea94ed2bea9a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,65,250,15,84,63,100,141,13,223,166,25,25,234,148,237,43,234,154,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
