His loyal staff liked to call him a Ã¢â‚¬Å“rock star.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ During a spring 2010 trip, journalist Michael Hastings looked on as McChrystal and his staff let off steam, partying and openly bashing the Obama administration. When HastingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s article appeared in Rolling Stone, it set off a political firestorm: McChrystal was unceremoniously fired.\n\nIn The Operators, Hastings picks up where his Rolling Stone coup ended. From patrol missions in the Afghan hinterlands to senior military advisorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ late-night bull sessions to hotel bars where spies and expensive hookers participate in nation-building, Hastings presents a shocking behind-the-scenes portrait of what he fears is an unwinnable war.  Written in prose that is at once eye-opening and other times uncannily conversational, readers of No Easy Day will take to HastingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ unyielding first-hand account of the Afghan War and its cast of players.   \n\nThe war Hastings describes is one dominated by political infighting, with various factions hidden away inside their own insulated bubbles, incapable of recognizing the truth, or refusing to admit the truth when it conflicts with ideology. The Obama administration comes off as weak and ineffective, the Afghan government as corrupt and impossibly incompetent, and the American military as an isolated culture more concerned by its own inner workings and politics than whether or not it can achieve actual &quot;success&quot; in a country as thoroughly broken as Afghanistan (or even what &quot;success&quot; might mean). The media gets the worst of the criticism though, compromising its professional integrity in exchange for access to the people in power. The only people presented at all sympathetically are the individual American soldiers and infantry units who face the true reality on the ground every day.\n\nIt's hard to come away from The Operators feeling like there's any hope -- not just for America in Afghanistan, but for our ability to accomplish anything substantial on a large scale. The dysfunction in America seems baked into our DNA, with political polarization and personal ambition overriding any sense of the greater good. Granted, this is just one person's view of the situation in Afghanistan, but given that no one is treated terribly well, it's hard not to believe that The Operators may be close to the truth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d77783dd1ab6485cc839df1453a96daef14db65","amp;dn":"Michael+Hastings+-+The+Operators","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d77783dd1ab6485cc839df1453a96daef14db65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,119,120,61,209,171,100,133,204,131,157,241,69,58,150,218,239,20,219,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
