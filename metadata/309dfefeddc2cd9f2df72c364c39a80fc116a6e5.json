Sawyer has proven himself to be â€œa writer of boundless confidence and bold scientific extrapolationâ€ (New York Times). Now, the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author explores the thin line between good and evil that every human being is capable of crossingâ€¦\r\n\r\nExperimental psychologist Jim Marchuk has developed a flawless technique for identifying the previously undetected psychopaths lurking everywhere in society. But while being cross-examined about his breakthrough in court, Jim is shocked to discover that he has lost his memories of six months of his life from twenty years previouslyâ€”a dark time during which he himself committed heinous acts.\r\n\r\nJim is reunited with Kayla Huron, his forgotten girlfriend from his lost period and now a quantum physicist who has made a stunning discovery about the nature of human consciousness. As a rising tide of violence and hate sweeps across the globe, the psychologist and the physicist combine forces in a race against time to see if they can do the impossibleâ€”change human natureâ€”before the entire world descends into darkness.\r\n\r\nRead by Scott Aiello\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309dfefeddc2cd9f2df72c364c39a80fc116a6e5","amp;dn":"Robert+J.+Sawyer+-+Quantum+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309dfefeddc2cd9f2df72c364c39a80fc116a6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,157,254,254,221,194,205,159,45,247,44,54,76,57,168,15,193,22,166,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
