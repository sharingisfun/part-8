Fletcher ProutyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exposeÃ‚Â´ of the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brutal methods of maintaining national security during the Cold War, was first published in the 1970s. However, virtually all copies of the book disappeared upon distribution, having been purchased en masse by shady Ã¢â‚¬Å“private buyers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Certainly, ProutyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s allegationsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as how the U-2 Crisis of 1960 was fixed to sabotage EisenhowerÃ¢â‚¬â€œKhrushchev talkÃ¢â‚¬â€cannot have pleased the CIA. The Secret Team appears once more with a new introduction by Jesse Ventura.\n\nAlso check out my other torrent: Books about CIA - Marchetti, Blum, Agee, Prouty, etc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05db8f9f1c56b63a0d64d7d88c95761cb37633ff","amp;dn":"The+Secret+Team+-+L.+Fletcher+Prouty%2C+1997+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05db8f9f1c56b63a0d64d7d88c95761cb37633ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,219,143,159,28,86,182,58,13,100,215,216,140,149,118,28,179,118,51,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
