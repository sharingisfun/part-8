Brownâ€™s greatest hero is Frank Oâ€™Connor, and like Oâ€™Connorâ€™s his stories uncover the final bleakness of a national life but in the same moment glow with its promise of love and life and belonging. Brownâ€™s Americans will try almost anything to connect. They tend to drink too much, to drive too fast, are a little too violent in their passions and even a little too religious. Too often they believe, they trustâ€”and then again they donâ€™t, depending not so much on whatâ€™s getting proffered as whoâ€™s proffering. They are always on the verge of something better. They only want a little more, only a little too much, and while we as readers want with all our hearts for them to get it, we also fear they might","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a9f54aa197d6433c541efc4b5531225b87ff58d","amp;dn":"Peter+Brown-A+Bright+Soothing+Noise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a9f54aa197d6433c541efc4b5531225b87ff58d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,159,84,170,25,125,100,51,197,65,239,196,181,83,18,37,184,127,245,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
