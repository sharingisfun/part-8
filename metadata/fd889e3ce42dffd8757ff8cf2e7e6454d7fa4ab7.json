His lurching, surface-peeled hip-hop/R&amp;B instrumentals remind us a bit of oOoOO or the juddering, IDM-inflected derivations of Mount Kimbie, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair to say he's got his own singular sound signature going on. 'Many Faces Out Of Focus' arose out of Lapalalux's ongoing experiments with cassette and reel-to-reel, and fittingly enough was initially released on tape, selling out its limited run in double-quick time. Though he uses digital methods and kit too, there's an analogue warmth and spaciousness that really comes across in everything he rolls out, especially on the epic 'Time, Patience, Everything'. 'Sister Pick', 'Cousin If' and 'Quick Kiss' would do Flying Lotus proud, rich soul hooks disrupted by cunningly controlled glitches and FX; even as he dissolves and deconstructs drum patterns before your very ears, he keeps the groove liquid and forward-moving. Fans of the Kimbies, James Blake's Ã¢â‚¬ËœCMYKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Four Tet, Bibio, FlyLo, Matthewdavid, Onra, Debruit and all those guys - meet your new favourite producer.\n\n\nPlease seed, and ig you enjoyed and want to support the artist, you can buy the album here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/many-faces-out-of-focus-ep/id426109461","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd889e3ce42dffd8757ff8cf2e7e6454d7fa4ab7","amp;dn":"Lapalux%3A+Many+Faces+Out+Of+Focus+%28EP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd889e3ce42dffd8757ff8cf2e7e6454d7fa4ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,136,158,60,228,45,255,216,117,127,248,207,46,126,100,84,215,250,74,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
