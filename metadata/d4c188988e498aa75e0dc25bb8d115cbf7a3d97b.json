He came to wider prominence in the early 1970s with a wildly theatrical stage show inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras costumes and voodoo ceremonies. Rebennack has recorded over 20 albums and in 1973 scored a top-20 hit with the jaunty funk-flavored &quot;Right Place Wrong Time&quot;, still perhaps his best-known song.\n\nThe winner of six Grammy Awards, Rebennack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on March 14, 2011.[2] In May 2013, Rebennack was the recipient of an honorary doctorate of fine arts from Tulane University. He was jokingly referred to by Tulane's president, Scott Cowen, as &quot;Dr. Dr. John&quot;.[3]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4c188988e498aa75e0dc25bb8d115cbf7a3d97b","amp;dn":"%5CDr.+John+4+Vinylrips+24bit%2F96khz%26amp%3B192khz+1968-1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4c188988e498aa75e0dc25bb8d115cbf7a3d97b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,193,136,152,142,73,138,167,94,13,194,91,184,209,21,203,247,163,217,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
