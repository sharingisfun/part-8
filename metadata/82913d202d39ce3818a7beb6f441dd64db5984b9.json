Maria has nearly reached her breaking point when she travels to Paris to visit her old friend Anna Dmitrivena (Laura Hope Crews), a Grand Duchess who also operates an exclusive bordello. While in Paris, Maria meets Anthony Halton (Melvyn Douglas), a visitor from America who seems quite taken with her. While Maria enjoys Anthony's attentions, she backs off and retreats to England. Shortly after her return, Maria and Frederick attend the races and she spots Anthony in the crowd. Maria is tempted to continue her romance with Anthony (who now realizes that she's married), while Frederick begins to wonder if his wife might be growing restless.\n\nSource: DVD Rip\n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : Angel.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 2 090 Kbps\nLength            : 1.27 GiB for 1h 27mn 5s 960ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 850 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 576 (1.361) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 224 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #1           : VobSub\nLanguage          : es\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028575/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028575/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles English, Spanish\n\nErnst Lubitsch - Angel (1937)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82913d202d39ce3818a7beb6f441dd64db5984b9","amp;dn":"Ernst+Lubitsch+-+Angel+%281937%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82913d202d39ce3818a7beb6f441dd64db5984b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,145,61,32,45,57,206,56,24,167,190,182,244,65,221,100,219,89,132,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
