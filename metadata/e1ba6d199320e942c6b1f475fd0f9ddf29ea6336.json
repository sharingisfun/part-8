Some of his works present a rather shocking world of sexuality and destructive erotic obsessions; others, less sensational, subtly portray the dynamics of family life in the context of the rapid changes in 20th-century Japanese society. Frequently his stories are narrated in the context of a search for cultural identity in which constructions of &quot;the West&quot; and &quot;Japanese tradition&quot; are juxtaposed.\n\nTanizaki's characters are often driven by obsessive erotic desires. In one of his last novels, Futen Rojin Nikki (Diary of a Mad Old Man, 1961Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1962), the aged diarist is struck down by a stroke brought on by an excess of sexual excitement. He records both his past desires and his current efforts to bribe his daughter-in-law to provide sexual titilation in return for Western baubles.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains all the book in Mobi format:\n\n* Quicksand ( Random House)\n\n* Seven Japanese Tales ( Silk Pagoda)\n\n* Some Prefer Nettles ( Perseus Books Group)\n\n* The Makioka Sisters ( Vintage)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun'ichir%C5%8D_Tanizaki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun'ichir%C5%8D_Tanizaki&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview25&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview25&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ba6d199320e942c6b1f475fd0f9ddf29ea6336","amp;dn":"Junichiro+Tanizaki+-++Japanese+Author+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ba6d199320e942c6b1f475fd0f9ddf29ea6336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,186,109,25,147,32,233,66,198,177,244,117,253,15,157,223,41,234,99,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
