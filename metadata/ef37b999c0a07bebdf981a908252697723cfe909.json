The gently propulsive Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShapeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sets the tone, pairing a twinkly, echo chamber piano lead against a sumptuous wash of chugging guitars and cavernous percussion, with co-lead vocalist and founder Dan WolfeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s melodious yet tentative croon soaring above. The evocative Ã¢â‚¬Å“PortraitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“LifterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ adopt a similar tone, eschewing WolfeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice for Van PeltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more ethereal delivery, wrapping both songs in gossamer strings of frosty, north country-inspired ambience. This penchant for sonic ephemera runs throughout the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relatively brief, 35-minute runtime, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s especially true of its latter half, with tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ghum,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sun Catcher,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cripple Creek Ferry,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the airy, wordless title cut existing in a sort of bucolic, semi-overcast vacuum. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly an unpleasant experience, as Breakfast In Fur always feels in command of the moment, and the largely unassuming Flyaway Garden, which is as hard to pin down as it is strangely comforting, demands a little bit of patience from the listener. Whether thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too much to ask in the increasingly attention span-deprived 21st century, is up for debate.\nRating 8.0/10\n\nTracklist:\n01. Shape.flac\n02. Portrait.flac\n03.
