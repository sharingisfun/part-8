Nugent initially gained fame as the lead guitarist of The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. His hits, mostly coming in the 1970s, such as &quot;Stranglehold&quot;, &quot;Cat Scratch Fever&quot;, &quot;Wango Tango&quot;, and &quot;Great White Buffalo&quot;, as well as his '60s Amboy Dukes hit &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;, remain popular today, and are played semi-often on classic rock and less frequently active rock radio stations. He is also noted for his staunch conservative political views and his strong defense and support of hunting and gun ownership rights.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGreat Gonzos! The Best of Ted Nugent, is the first compilation album by Ted Nugent, collecting his best-known tracks from his time with Epic Records.
