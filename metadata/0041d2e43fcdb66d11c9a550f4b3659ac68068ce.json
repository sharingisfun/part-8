The story line is &quot;based loosely on a short story&quot; written by Ken Hensley in June and July 1972.\n\nThe original vinyl release was a gatefold sleeve, the front of which was designed by Roger Dean. The inner of the gatefold had pictures of the band and the LP itself was housed in a liner which had the lyrics printed on it.\n\nTwo songs charted in the United States, &quot;Blind Eye&quot; (#97) and &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; (#91). &quot;Spider Woman&quot; reached #13 in Germany.
