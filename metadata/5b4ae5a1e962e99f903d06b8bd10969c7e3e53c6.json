Actually, Coltrane penned only one of the eight tunes, while Sanders wrote six, but the spirit of the master looms heavily throughout. Sanders displays an uncanny resemblance to Trane's unique way of over-blowing and his special ability to get inside a ballad. Pianist John Hicks is in perfect form and contributes mightily to the success of the session. Most will probably prefer the original Coltrane to Sanders' imitations, but Africa is nonetheless a joyous and worthy tribute to one of the giants of jazz. This album marked somewhat of a backtrack for the saxophonist, as he had frequently become identified with much more traditional playing. ~ AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nPharoah Sanders ( Tenor Saxophone ) \nJohn Hicks ( Piano ) \nCurtis Lundy ( Double Bass ) \nIdris Muhammed ( Drums ) \n\nPharoah Sanders - Africa Tracks:\n01  You've Got To Have Freedom ( Pharoah Sanders ) 10:06 \n02  Naima ( John Coltrane ) 5:29 \n03  Origin ( Pharoah Sanders ) 6:55 \n04  Speak Low ( Ogden Nash/Kurt Weill ) 8:10 \n05  After The Morning ( John Hicks ) 6:35 \n06  Africa ( Pharoah Sanders ) 8:26 \n07  Heart To Heart ( Pharoah Sanders ) 7:24\n08  Duo ( Pharoah Sanders ) 4:34","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4ae5a1e962e99f903d06b8bd10969c7e3e53c6","amp;dn":"Pharoah+Sanders+-+Africa+%281987%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4ae5a1e962e99f903d06b8bd10969c7e3e53c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,74,229,161,233,98,233,159,144,61,6,184,189,16,150,156,126,62,83,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
