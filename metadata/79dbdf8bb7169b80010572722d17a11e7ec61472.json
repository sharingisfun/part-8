My Last Words\n\nAfter being booted from Metallica in 1983, Dave Mustaine put together his own band Megadeth and two years later released the mediocre Killing Is My Business ... And Business Is Good. At the time, it seemed clear who the real genius in Metallica was, despite Mustaine's claims to the contrary. But a year later, when Megadeth unraveled Peace Sells ... But Who's Buying, Mustaine's boasting took on new relevance. Despite some rather inane lyrics, the disc is one of the most powerful and contagious thrash records of the era. In addition to the propulsive title track, the album features the scorchers &quot;Wake Up Dead,&quot; &quot;Black Friday,&quot; and &quot;My Last Words.&quot; The band would later simplify and commercialize its sound, but here is where it shines darkest. --Jon Wiederhorn \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79dbdf8bb7169b80010572722d17a11e7ec61472","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+Peace+Sells...+But+Who%5C%27s+Buying","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79dbdf8bb7169b80010572722d17a11e7ec61472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,219,223,139,183,22,155,128,1,5,114,114,45,23,161,30,126,198,20,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
