The waking up has always been the same: an unfamiliar chamber and a strange enemy town beyond my window. Fresh hot blood runs out of the wounds in my open hands, terrifying silence and loneliness surround me. So I sit in darkness waiting for the next day. For the day when I will perhaps have to go there to meet them again. But so is my mission, my destiny. Chasing the worst human creatures, monsters and freaks. Tracking and killing murderers of children, poisoners of city wells, arsonists who burn houses with innocent sleeping families inside.\n\nDaemonica is a fully 3D dark action adventure which takes place in medieval England.
