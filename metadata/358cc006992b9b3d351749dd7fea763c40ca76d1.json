Gilbert's Developmental Biology. I just bought it and scanned it myself. The text is searchable, and it is bookmarked to easily find the chapters. I changed scanners toward the end, so the quality of the last few chapters is much better. Some of the text on the side might be slightly blurry as it took me a while to get my 'technique' down, but it is very readable and beats paying $130 for it in the bookstore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:358cc006992b9b3d351749dd7fea763c40ca76d1","amp;dn":"Developmental+Biology+Ninth+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"358cc006992b9b3d351749dd7fea763c40ca76d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,140,192,6,153,43,155,61,53,23,73,221,127,234,118,60,64,202,118,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
