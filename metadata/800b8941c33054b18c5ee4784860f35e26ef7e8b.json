He is a blues pioneer on the Canadian scene. It was Walsh who paid the highest dues so that later Canadian blues acts, such as the Jeff Healey Band, the Colin James Band, the Powder Blues, Sue Foley, The Sidemen and The Highliners could also enjoy their success. The Canadian blues scene, which has blossomed nicely in the last few years, was relatively barren in the late 1960s when The Downchild Blues Band first started out.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800b8941c33054b18c5ee4784860f35e26ef7e8b","amp;dn":"Downchild+Blues+Band+-+6+Albums+1971+-+2009+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800b8941c33054b18c5ee4784860f35e26ef7e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,11,137,65,195,48,84,177,140,94,228,120,72,96,243,94,38,239,126,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
