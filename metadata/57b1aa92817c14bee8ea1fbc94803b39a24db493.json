With their Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rising of the Winter Full MoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demo, they generated a massive response in the underground, causing them to be signed up by Profound Lore Records. Rising of the Winter Full Moon displayed a fierce focused vision of what Winterfylleth wanted to achieve through their music, and with their Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ghost of HeritageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ debut (that was released on the Winterfylleth of 2008), this vision was realised.\n\nWith their music Winterfylleth conjure moods and emotions that range from vicious and violent to melodic and elegant. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ghost Of HeritageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ signalled a new shift for the underground UK black metal scene, with Winterfylleth being considered by much of the music press to be one of the most distinct acts of this movement, gaining critical acclaim from the worlds music media, most notably of which was being voted in Unrestrained MagazinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“25 Best Albums of 2008Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nLyrically, the band delve into tales of EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s archaic history, re-counting major events, battles, the spiritual outlook of the people and the way they lived and even draw inspiration from certain sites and scenery that grace the countryside of England and have played an integral part in EnglandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history.\n\nIn 2009 Winterfylleth had some personnel changes and regrouped adding to their strong original line up of Naughton &amp; Lucas.
