The fusing of virtual reality and cybernetics has ushered in the era of the personal surrogate, android substitutes that let users interact with the world without ever leaving their homes. It's a perfect world, and it's up to Detectives Harvey Greer and Pete Ford of the Metro Police Department to keep it that way. But to do so theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to stop a techno-terrorist bent on returning society to a time when people lived their lives instead of merely experiencing them. \n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Infinite Vacation [Complete]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8667843&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8667843&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Absolute Zero (English) [Complete]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8639200&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8639200&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n    Any questions?
