With Tim van Delft on drums, the Croatian Vedran Mircetic on guitar, Jop van Summeren on bass and Rocco Bell on keys, beatring and cowbell, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no question that Torre Florim has a diverse company on his side. A powerful five-headed coalition, showing its love for the old roots music, though not afraid to put that in a new and refreshing perspective.\nSince then theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done shows in every possible setting, from small bars to big clubs with bands like Fu Manchu and the Belgian dEUS.\n\nDe Staat has a record deal with Excelsior Recordings since december 2008 and their debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWait For EvolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released on january 9th 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f632b41c8a137ba035fdea051ada41367d34fb","amp;dn":"De+Staat+-+Wait+For+Evolution+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f632b41c8a137ba035fdea051ada41367d34fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,246,50,180,28,138,19,123,160,53,253,234,5,26,218,65,54,125,52,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
