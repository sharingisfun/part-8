Start a new game and make sure â€œDisplay tutorialsâ€ is checked to see these. Itâ€™s quite basic, as any good tutorial should be, and should ease new players into the mechanics and controls for the game.\r\n- Archers are now shooting at their full bow range.\r\n- Thereâ€™s a new Archer preference, â€œPursue enemies out of rangeâ€. When this is off, your archers will no longer chase enemies. This is more important now because of the above fix. This preference should keep your Archers guarding your walls from running down.\r\n-Spiders should no longer be climbing out of the map edges.\r\n-Archers should now be using Fire arrows properly.\r\n-The â€œNordic Roof Tilesâ€ are now saving and loading correctly.\r\n-Wall Sconces are fixed.\r\n-Water no longer breaks line of sight, this allows your Archers to shoot Skeletons and Necromancers who are underwater.\r\n-The de-spawn timer for corpses has been reduced to 24 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ef6b224c4fca5d3fee349b3aecad967399494d7","amp;dn":"Timber+and+Stone+v+1.71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ef6b224c4fca5d3fee349b3aecad967399494d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,246,178,36,196,252,165,211,254,227,73,179,174,202,217,103,57,148,148,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
