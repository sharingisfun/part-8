From a fling-gone-wrong to friend breakups and a new romance, SarahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature wit and sharp observations take you on a journey at once so deviously funny and surprisingly compassionate that it might just steal your heartÃ¢â‚¬â€not to mention your pants.\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sarah Colonna does it again with another hilariously candid, and at times utterly heartbreaking, collection of essays. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me alcohol poisoning.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jenny Mollen, New York Times bestselling author of I LIKE YOU JUST THE WAY I AM)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book will make you say, Ã¢â‚¬ËœOh my God. I thought it was just me...Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll laugh with Sarah (okay, maybe at her a little, too) and root for her all the way through this book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll feel like your new best friend. And since sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not your actual best friend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to be your own best friend, and this book is the perfect guide for learning how.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jen Kirkman, New York Times bestselling author of I CAN BARELY TAKE CARE OF MYSELF)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ Has Anyone Seen My Pants? is amazing, hilarious, and I thought I was the only one that screenshot-ed texts from guys and sent it to her girlfriends. This is going to be a huge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Meghan McCain, New York Times bestselling author of DIRTY SEXY POLITICS)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I read it in one sitting; pants off.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Kelly Oxford, New York Times bestselling author of EVERYTHING'S PERFECT WHEN YOU'RE A LIAR)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Stand-up comedian Colonna brings more irreverent tales of dating, drinking, and debauchery, imparting wisdom like the vulgar older sister youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always wanted. She maintains her signature charm and caustic humor, and the final chapterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy ending is worth sticking around for. .Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Publishers Weekly)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f735c8a3135efc537d1bd6a9537602d6aaa18ded","amp;dn":"Has+Anyone+Seen+My+Pants+-+Sarah+Colonna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f735c8a3135efc537d1bd6a9537602d6aaa18ded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,53,200,163,19,94,252,83,125,27,214,169,83,118,2,214,170,161,141,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
