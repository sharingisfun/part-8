In forty years, the War on Drugs has accounted for more than 45 million arrests, made America the world's largest jailer, and damaged poor communities at home and abroad. Yet for all that, drugs are cheaper, purer, and more available today than ever before.\n\nFilmed in more than twenty states, The House I Live In captures heart-wrenching stories from individuals at all levels of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War on Drugs. From the dealer to the grieving mother, the narcotics officer to the senator, the inmate to the federal judge, the film offers a penetrating look inside AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest warÃ¢â‚¬â€a definitive portrait revealing its profound human rights implications.\n\nThe film recognizes the seriousness of drug abuse as a matter of public health, and investigates the tragic errors and shortcomings that have meant this symptom is most often treated as a cause for law enforcement, creating a vast machine that largely feeds on AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poor, and especially on minority communities. Beyond simple misguided policy, the film examines how political and economic corruption have fueled the war for 40 years, despite persistent evidence of its moral, economic, and practical failures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93436ddd1b5ed25b76c51f62324706fa8a6431eb","amp;dn":"The.House.I.Live.In.2012.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93436ddd1b5ed25b76c51f62324706fa8a6431eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,67,109,221,27,94,210,91,118,197,31,98,50,71,6,250,138,100,49,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
