They formed in Louisville, Kentucky in 1987 from the remains of Squirrel Bait. Though they disbanded circa 1991, they continue to be a massive influence on today's post-rock scene.\n\nSlint's first album Tweez was recorded by Steve Albini in 1987 and released in obscurity on the Jennifer Hartman Records in 1989. It was followed two years later by the critically acclaimed Spiderland, released on Touch and Go Records (Touch and Go would later re-release Tweez). Considered a seminal work, Spiderland is a largely instrumental album characterised by its dark, syncopated rhythms, sparse guitar lines and haunting subject matters. The record's impact was such that some have suggested it is the first true post rock album, helping to usher in a new wave of bands seeking a move away from the unfettered aggression of hardcore punk but not its underlying ethic. Spiderland culminates in the baleful &quot;Good Morning Captain,&quot; perhaps their most recognised track (it would later feature on the soundtrack to the Larry Clark film Kids, though not in the film itself). In 1993, Slint posthumously released a brief untitled EP. This two song record was actually recorded in 1989. It was intended to be released as a 12&quot; single on Jennifer Hartman Records, and original copies of the Tweez LP contained a flier advertisement for it included as an insert. However, Slint signed to Touch &amp; Go before it was sent to press and the master tapes were shelved.\n\nMembers of Slint have since appeared in a number of bands. Former guitarist David Pajo currently performs under the moniker Papa M and also plays bass for the NYC street metal band Early Man. Pajo was also a member of Tortoise, Palace, and the short-lived Billy Corgan-fronted rock band Zwan before their breakup in 2003. Guitarist Brian McMahan formed The For Carnation in 1996 and also played with Palace. Britt Walford played drums in Evergreen, and, under the name Shannon Doughton, for The Breeders on the album Pod. Ethan Buckler plays in King Kong.\n\nLong since disbanded, three members of Slint ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Brian McMahan, David Pajo, and Britt Walford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reunited to curate the 2005 All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in Camber Sands, England. Slint have recently played a small number of shows in the U.S. and in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an article written by Steve Albini after Spiderland came out. It appeared in the March 30, 1991 issue of Melody Maker.\n\nSince about 1980, America has been host to an ever-increasing parasitic infestation of rock bands of ever-dwindling originality. It seems there is no one left on the continent with an aspiration to lay guitar that hasn't formed a band and released a record. And that record sounds a little bit like Dinosaur Jr.\n\nTrust me on this; all but maybe three of those records are pure bullshit.\n\nMy primary association with rock music is that I am a fan of it, though listening to the aforementioned nearly killed that. In its best state, rock music invigorates me, changes my mood, triggers introspection or envelopes me with sheer sound. Spiderland does all those things, simultaneously and in turns, more than any records I can think of in five years.\n\nSpiderland is, unfortunately, Slint's swan song, the band having succumbed to the internal pressures which eventually punctuate all bands' biographies. It's an amazing record though, and no one still capable of being moved by rock music should miss it. In 10 years it will be a landmark and you'll have to scramble to buy a copy then. Beat the rush.\n\nSlint formed in 1986 as an outlet and pastime for four friends from Louisville, Kentucky. Their music was strange, wholly their own, sparse and tight. What immediately set them apart was their economy and precision. Slint was that rare band willing to play just one or two notes at a time and sometimes nothing at all. Their only other recording, 1989's Tweez hints at their genius, but only a couple of the tracks have anything like the staying power of Spiderland.\n\nSpiderland is a majestic album, sublime and strange, made more brilliant by its simplicity and quiet grace. Songs evolve and expand from simple statements that are inverted and truncated in a manner that seems spontaneous, but is so precise and emphatic that it must be intuitive or orchestrated or both.\n\nStraining to find a band to compare them with, I can only think of two, and Slint doesn't sound anything like either of them. Structurally and in tone, they recall Television circa Marquee Moon and Crazy Horse, whose simplicity they echo and whose style they most certainly do not.\n\nTo whom would Pere Ubu or Chrome have been compared in 1972? Forgive me, I am equally clueless.\n\nSlint's music has always been primarily instrumental, and Spiderland isn't a radical departure, but the few vocals are among the most pungent of any album around. When I first heard Brian McMahan whisper the pathetic words to &quot;Washer&quot;, I was embarrassed for him. When I listened to the song again, the content eluded me and I was staggered by the sophistication and subtle beauty of the phrasing. The third time, the story made me sad nearly to tears. Genius.\n\nSpiderland is flawless. The dry, unembellished recording is so revealing it sometimes feels like eavesdropping. The crystalline guitar of Brian McMahan and the glassy, fluid guitar of David Pajo seem to hover in space directly past the listener's nose. The incredibly precise-yet-instinctive drumming has the same range and wallop it would in your living room.\n\nOnly two other bands have meant as much to me as Slint in the past few years and only one of them, The Jesus Lizard, have made a record this good. We are in a time of midgets: dance music, three varieties of simple-minded hard rock genre crap, soulless-crooning, infantile slogan-studded rap and ball-less balladeering. My instincts tell me the dry spell will continue for a while- possibly until the bands Slint will inspire reach maturity. Until then, play this record and kick yourself if you never got to see them live. In ten years, you'll lie like the cocksucker you are and say you did anyway.\n\nTen fucking stars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f91b1780b653c58584b683fd6773d96bded2622","amp;dn":"Slint+-+Spiderland+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f91b1780b653c58584b683fd6773d96bded2622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,145,177,120,11,101,60,88,88,75,104,63,214,119,61,150,189,237,38,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
