Yet as part of Record Store DayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Black Friday promotion, the Dead release a set from 1970 on vinyl which for over 40 years was thought to be unrecorded.\nThe Grateful Dead played an acoustic set at the intimate Great Highway in San Francisco on April 18, 1970. The 80-minute, 17-song performance was originally billed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mickey Hart and His Heartbeats and Bobby Ace and His Cards from the Bottom of the Deck.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Recently, long lost tapes of the show were discovered leading to the release of Family Dog at the Great Highway, San Francisco as a 2-LP set on Black Friday (November 29). A CD version will be available at Dead.net on the same day, with plans for a digital version in the future.\n\nAccording to Rhino, the band works through a mix of original songs (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Friend Of The Devil,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Speedway BoogieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), covers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mama Tried,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wake Up Little SusieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and traditionals (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Know You RiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), followed by six solo acoustic songs from Ron Ã¢â‚¬Å“PigpenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ McKernan, the harmonica-wielding bluesman and founding member of the band who passed away in 1973.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f1c1057a394265a3ec6e8e8659746c27404fc0","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Family+Dog+at+the+Great+Highway+%282013%29+MP3%40320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f1c1057a394265a3ec6e8e8659746c27404fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,241,193,5,122,57,66,101,163,236,110,142,134,89,116,108,39,64,79,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
