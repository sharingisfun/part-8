This is one of director Louis Malle's finest films: others include The Fire Within and Au Revoir Les Enfants. Laurent (Benoit Ferreux) is 14 years old and anxious to lose his virginity. However, he has a very close family circle, and, between the family and school, he is too closely watched to get anywhere. He makes the most of an opportunity to neck with the girls at his older brothers' party and later almost gets to lose his virginity in a bordello, but his boisterously drunken brothers interrupt him. His real opportunity arises while his mother takes him for a rest-cure for his heart murmur at a very conventional spa.\n\n***\nName.........: Murmur of the Heart.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,632 KB or 733,831,168 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:58:20 (170,224 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 732 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 86 kb/s (43/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 560x352 (1.59:1) [=35:22](Criterion DVD rip; ggoes)\n\nFrench with hardsubbed English subtitles. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2801&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=6&amp;thread=2801&lt;/a&gt;\n\n***\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
