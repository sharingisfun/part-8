I myself haven't read them all yet, but goddamn are they sick...Dealing with Nazi culture, serial killers, and child abuse, they are definitely the most extreme thing I've ever read in my life. I definitely DO NOT support the content of these, but they're collectors items, and quite an interesting read, although horrifying.\n\nIncluded are:\n\nEye\nForced Mental\nFP II\nGates Afterword\nIndex Slayer\nInterviews\nParasite 1-20\nPure 1-3\n\nI'm honestly not entirely sure of all the content of these, because I've only read a couple Pure zines, but needless to say, definitely not for the faint of heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab8a735ac2745c2a4fa5966df895d9f21f7f815","amp;dn":"Peter+Sotos+Zines+%28Pure+and+Misc%29+Whitehouse+Sutcliffe+Jugend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab8a735ac2745c2a4fa5966df895d9f21f7f815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,184,167,53,172,39,69,194,164,250,89,102,223,137,93,159,33,247,248,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
