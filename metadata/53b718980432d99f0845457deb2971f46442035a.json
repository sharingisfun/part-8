How good it feels to have Lisa RandallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusual blend of top flight science, clarity, and charm on our side.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Richard Dawkins)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“RandallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lucid explanations of . . . the frontiers of physicsÃ¢â‚¬â€including her own dazzling ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€are highly illuminating, and her hearty defense of reason and science is a welcome contribution. . . . Read this book today to understand the science of tomorrow.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Steven Pinker)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Beautifully written. . . . An impressive overview of what scientists (of any kind) get up to, how they work and why science is an inherently creative endeavor.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Times Higher Education (London) )\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Startlingly honest [and] beautifully written. . . . RandallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s calm authority and clarity of explanation are exemplary. . . .
