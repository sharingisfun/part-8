There, he meets a strange girl and unknowingly changes the fate of\n  the world forever. \n\n\n\n\n  * Watch the story unfold as you battle the enemy hordes in over 80hrs in a\n  compelling and innovative turn based-based combat system \n  * Choose the path of Darkness or Light through a truly epic story, spanning\n  multiple generations \n  * Build your ultimate army of warriors and master Extra Skills, Special Arts\n  and Over Kills to defeat colossal enemies! \n  * Use the all new Card Skill System to create your hero's unique persona. \n  * Featuring stunning new and beautifully animated character portraits. \n  * The Soul Breed System returns! Unite with your chosen bride to shape the\n  fate of the next generation of heroes \n\n\n  Agarest: Generations of War ZERO exclusive game features!Agarest: Generations\n  of War ZERO contains many of the unique features found in the first release\n  of the series such as Extended Areas allowing you to chain attacks together\n  in huge combos, the Blacksmith's Guild for experimentation in crafting of\n  items and weapons and of course, the Soul Breed System where you must\n  carefully choose your bride as this decision will directly affect following\n  generations. \n\n\n  In addition to these existing game features, the following new features have\n  been added: \n  The new Vacation Days allow you to get to know your party members better and\n  unlock bonus items and locations by visiting various places in the towns.\n  Also, as you build your relationship with the rest of your party you will\n  unlock new costumes for them to wear. \n\n\n  Character portraits displayed during conversations have been vastly improved\n  with the implementation of Motion Portrait. This brings characters to life\n  with subtle animations really helping to enhance the stunning artwork. \n\n\n  With various other changes such as improved graphics and a brand new Card\n  Skill System to allow you to customise your starting character, this is a\n  prequel you won't want to miss. \n\n\n  Exclusive to the PC version, this new and improved version of Agarest:\n  Generations Of War ZERO now features Cloud Saving (which has also been added\n  to Agarest: Generations Of War very recently). We've also added the ability\n  to decide which direction you wish the controls to be offset along with a\n  revamp of the DLC menu giving you control to pick and choose how DLC is added\n  to your existing saves. As expected there is full mouse and keyboard support,\n  full gamepad support, Steam achievements, higher resolution art and a number\n  of other user interface changes to ensure that PC gamers receive the best\n  gaming experience possible.
