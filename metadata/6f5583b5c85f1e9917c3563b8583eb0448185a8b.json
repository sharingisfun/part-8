Join me in hating the title, which should be &quot;The Complete Sonnets and OTHER Poems,&quot; since sonnets themselves are poems.\n\nThis will be the last Shakespeare book I will share (at least until I find some more), so please check my torrents for a variety of reference books on Shakespeare and other topics.  Also, it bears repeating, at www.archive.org, you can find some incredible Shakespeare materials, including scans of very old books from very old British libraries.  As always, please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5583b5c85f1e9917c3563b8583eb0448185a8b","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%3A+The+Complete+Sonnets+and+Poems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5583b5c85f1e9917c3563b8583eb0448185a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,85,131,181,200,95,30,153,23,195,86,59,133,131,235,4,72,24,90,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
