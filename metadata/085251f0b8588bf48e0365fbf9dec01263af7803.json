His unhappy father blames this disgraceful prison stint for the death of Bruno's mother. No one wants to hire an ex-con, and a romantic liaison with another, very delicately balanced former addict only adds to the burden Bruno is carrying. Mauvais Fils skillfully limns Bruno's daily fight to keep his head above water.\n\nREVIEW\nfilmsdefrance.com, by James Travers\nIn Un mauvais fils, director Claude Sautet explores two of his favourite themes, which predominate in most Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if not all Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of his films. The first is the conflict between different generations, in this case between a father and son Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a conflict which arises from what appear to be, initially, insurmountable barriers based on individual experiences, innate prejudices and flawed moral judgements. In most cases, the barriers are ultimately broken down and the two parties are brought together, although the subtle process by which this happens is hard to define and forms part of the magic that is SautetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cinema.\n\nThe second recurring theme is one which Sautet shares with many of his French New Wave contemporaries, notably FranÃƒÂ§ois Truffaut, namely the complex relationship between men and women, explored with great insight, intimacy and compassion. The lovers in SautetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s films often share a single tragic flaw which initially brings them together but ultimately drives them apart. Un mauvais fils is perhaps the most obvious example of this, where two ex-drug addicts, Catherine and Bruno, form an immediate bond because of their past experiences, but in the end it is these experiences which make it increasingly difficult to sustain their relationship. The only way such a relationship can succeed is by both parties abandoning their past and committing themselves to a totally new future Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a feat which not all of SautetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters are capable of doing. In Un mauvais fils, the spectator has no idea how the Catherine and Bruno will end up until the very last camera shot: the dividing line between tragedy and a happy ending is very fine indeed.\n\nUn mauvais fils epitomises the kind of gentle film drama for which French cinema is renowned. Its unhurried pace and simple narrative makes it easy for the spectator to follow what is happening and form a close bond with all of the main characters, each of whom is played to perfection by an exceptionally talented cast. Patrick Dewaere reprises a role very similar to his earlier creations (notably his role in F... comme Fairbanks), but with far greater subtlety and humanity, making this perhaps his most noteworthy screen appearance. Yves Robert and Brigitte Fossey also turn in fine performances as DewaereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on-screen father and lover respectively. The constantly shifting relationship between these three characters is compelling in its naturalism and dramatic intensity, and demonstrates yet again SautetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genius for depicting lifelike relationships within an intelligent and interesting drama. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc282/deadmeadow33/mfils-6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
