Hotter This Year [Hot Steppa Remix]\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION : The title of this album gives away Kamoze's clear intention: to continue cashing in on the massive success of his 1994 single &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot; (the second line of which was &quot;I am the lyrical gangster&quot;;). It may not have been as much of a commercial success, but with Lyrical Gangsta Kamoze does do an effective job of continuing to develop his uniquely aggressive reggae-hip-hop fusion. \n\nOn several tracks he seems to be trying just a bit too hard to prove his gangster bona fides: when he repeatedly drops the F-bomb on &quot;Hole in Ya Head&quot; it sounds forced and awkward, and &quot;Kildatsoundboy,&quot; which is built on a highly effective adaptation of the &quot;Ring the Alarm&quot; rhythm, is just a bit over the top, lyrically speaking. But his duet performance with Guru (of Gang Starr fame) is a great juxtaposition of two very different rapping styles, and &quot;King Selassie&quot; is a surprisingly sincere and sweetly melodic example of rootswise dancehall. The remix of &quot;Hot Steppa&quot; and the dubwise &quot;Imagine...In Dub&quot; are also both well worth hearing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef29c3c87c303791c06f3e56ad29e6bf06640a65","amp;dn":"Ini+Kamoze+-+Lyrical+Gangsta+--+%40+%7BMW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef29c3c87c303791c06f3e56ad29e6bf06640a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,41,195,200,124,48,55,145,192,111,62,86,173,41,230,191,6,100,10,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
