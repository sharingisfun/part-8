Strong, sensitive and sexy, the temporarily dry-docked naval officer was everything she'd ever dreamed of in a manÃ¢â‚¬Â¦in a husband.\nBut Rush placed duty to his country above all else. Though he and Lindy were swept away on a tide of passion, he was called back to sea. They say absence makes the heart grow fonderÃ¢â‚¬â€but will their marriage survive their partings?\n\nNavy Blues (Navy Series #2)\nDespite her ex-husband's bullheadedness, Carol Kyle knew he'd be the perfect man to father the child she so desperately wanted. Yet she also realized that the strong, honorable man would never allow his child to be raised without a father. So Carol needed to plot, to plan, to maneuver, to *seduce* Steve into her bed for one last time . . .\nStill, the passion when they were together was never the problem -- it was the absences that tore them apart. Had they grown enough to chance trying again -- especially when Carol's plan seemed about to work?\n\nNavy Brat (Navy Series #3)\nErin MacNamera had one hard-and-fast rule: never, never, never fall for a navy man. From birth through college, Erin had lived and breathed the navy as her father's career moved her family countless times. Now all Erin wants is to put down roots and live a normal life. But then she meets navy man Brand Davis...and falls in love.\n\nNavy Woman (Navy Series #4)\nDespite the strictly taboo laws of naval fraternizing, navy attorney Catherine Fredrickson and her new boss, Royce Nyland, find themselves strongly attracted. For how long will they be able to resist each other...? \n\nNavy Baby (Navy Series #5)\nForced into marriage by Hannah Raymond's preacher father, naval seaman Riley Murdock vows to be a good husband and give his children everything he never had. But is this enough to lead to love? \n\nNavy Husband (Navy Series #6)\nHi Ali,\nJust a quick note from your ever-loving sister. Wanted to bring you up to date on how things are going with Jazmine. After all, I am Ã¢â‚¬â€ according to the Navy Ã¢â‚¬â€ your official &quot;parenting plan.&quot;\nI adore Jazmine. But who knew that a nine-year-old had so many opinions? Including an opinion on my love life (or lack thereof). I'm pretty sure she's trying to set me up with that friend of yours, Adam Kennedy. Excuse me Lieutenant Commander Adam Kennedy.\nYeah, yeah, I know. He's great looking and very helpful(if a little dictatorial), but I am not in the market for a Navy husband.\nDo me a favor Ã¢â‚¬â€ tell your daughter that, okay?\nLove you. Miss you.\nShana\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b259886743585de4a68e87f22c8302ef257373a1","amp;dn":"Navy+Series+by+Debbie+Macomber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b259886743585de4a68e87f22c8302ef257373a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,89,136,103,67,88,93,228,166,142,135,242,44,131,2,239,37,115,115,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
