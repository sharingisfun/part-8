One of the craziest movies I have ever seen. I just wanted to spread the craziness around. Look for the full DVD rip of the movie &quot;Kids&quot; by the same writer coming in about a week.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nConstructing this film through random scenes, director Harmony Korine abruptly jettisoned any sort of narrative plot, so here we go: Solomon and Tummler are two bored teenage boys who live in Xenia, Ohio. A few years ago, a tornado swept through it, destroying more than half the town and killing the same amount, including Solomon's father. The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears. \n\nYear.............: 1997\nCountry..........: USA\nAudio............: English DD 2.0\nSubtitles........: English (Not hard coded)\nDVD Source.......: RETAIL\nDVD Format.......: NTSC\nMenus............: Untouched\nVideo............: Untouched\nDVD-extras.......: Untouched\nDVD-Audio........: Untouched\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc2b4cdd0be0ca91cf8583c081df9f9abd41738","amp;dn":"Gummo+-+NTSC+-+English+-+Full+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc2b4cdd0be0ca91cf8583c081df9f9abd41738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,194,180,205,208,190,12,169,28,248,88,60,8,29,249,249,171,212,23,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
