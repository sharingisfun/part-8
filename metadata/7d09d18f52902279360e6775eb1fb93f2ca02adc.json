Then the credit crunch of August 2007 turned into the great crash of September-October 2008, leading one apologist for the system, Willem Buiter, to write of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the end of capitalism as we knew it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the world witnessed the way in which the runaway speculation of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“shadowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ banking system wreaked havoc on world markets, leaving real human devastation in its wake. Faced with the financial crisis, some economic commentators began to talk of Ã¢â‚¬Å“zombie banksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€financial institutions that were in an Ã¢â‚¬Å“undead stateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and incapable of fulfilling any positive function, but representing a threat to everything else. What they do not realize is that twenty-first century capitalism as a whole is a zombie system, seemingly dead when it comes to achieving human goals.\n\nChris Harman uses the basic concepts of Marx to show that crises are not accidental features of capitalism, but are built into its very structure, and that only a radical restructuring of the system can save humanity from the recurring crises, wars, and ecological disasters capitalism brings in its wake.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book needs to be read far and wide. It is a clear, incisive warning of the massive dangers posed by a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrunaway systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the threat it poses for the future of humanity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Graham Turner, author of The Credit Crunch\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the present-day crisis and its place in the history of capitalism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Alex Callinicos, author of Bonfire of Illusions\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Harman\nPublished by Haymarket Books in 2010\nEPUB, Retail, 424 pages, English (1608461041)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d09d18f52902279360e6775eb1fb93f2ca02adc","amp;dn":"Zombie+Capitalism%3AGlobal+Crisis+and+the+Relevance+of+Marx%28Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d09d18f52902279360e6775eb1fb93f2ca02adc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,9,209,143,82,144,34,121,54,14,103,117,235,31,185,63,44,160,42,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
