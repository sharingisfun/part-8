I believe this is the best version of the game to download. It's a bundle that works with residualvm. This package contains the data from both discs, but not in a mountable or burnable form. Using residualvm (which works a lot like scummvm) you can launch the game in modern operating systems with much less hassle than installing it from the discs.\n\nAlso, in the past month a modder has created a point &amp; click interface for Grim Fandango. I have included this mod in this package. It runs by default. If you don't like it, or it's buggy, you can still use the keyboard controls - or you can easily disable it (instructions at the bottom of this file).\n\nEnjoy the game!\n\n==How to run==\n\n1. Extract everything in this zip file\n2. Run Residualvm.exe\n3. Click &quot;Add Game&quot;\n4. Double click on the &quot;GrimFiles&quot; folder\n5. Click &quot;Choose&quot;\n6. Click OK\n7. Click start\n\nTo make it run in fullscreen, press alt+enter (hold down alt, press enter)\n\n==More Info==\n\nFrom the readme that came with the mouse mod:\n\n--------\nControls\n--------\nMost of the keyboard controls still work in the original manner;\nwhile the game should be playable 100% using the mouse only, if there are\nsome puzzles which you prefer to solve using the old interface, you can do so.\n\n* New controls *\nLeft-click   : Walk and use \n               If you left-click on an object, it is used. If Manny\n               is holding an inventory object, it is used on the scene object.\nDouble-click : Run and use\n               Same as single-click, except Manny will run to the object.\nRight-click  : Look at / Use inventory object on its own\n               Same as left-click, except Manny will look at an object instead\n               of using it. If Manny is holding an inventory object, right-click\n               will use it on its own (e.g. deck of cards, or fire extinguisher\n               in Beaver Dam)\nMiddle-click : Open Inventory\n(or I key)     If Manny is holding an object, he will put it away.\n               Left-click within the inventory selects an object, right-click\n               will make Manny look at it.\nSpace key    : Show all hotspots in the scene\nShift + Z    : Toggle developer mode\n\n* Useful old controls *\nAlt+Enter    : Toggle fullscreen mode\nArrow keys   : Control Manny the old fashioned way\nE,U,P,I      : Examine, Use, Pickup, Inventory\nF1           : Menu (use arrow keys to navigate)\nEscape       : Skip some cutscenes\n.            : Skip dialogue lines\n\nMore documents about residualvm and the mouse mod are in the docs folder.\n\nThe mouse mod is from here: http://forums.residualvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=623\nResidualVM is software that runs Grim Fandango in its own virtual machine, making it more compatible with Windows 7. more info here: http://residualvm.org/\n\nTo play without the point &amp; click mod, delete residualvm.exe and rename residualvm.exe.old to residualvm.exe - or download residualvm and play using these game files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4fdfbd6d66e83be195f26cbc0dd27c9b86616f9","amp;dn":"Grim+Fandango+-+PC+-+including+Mouse+Support%2C+V0+Soundtrack%2C+Puz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4fdfbd6d66e83be195f26cbc0dd27c9b86616f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,253,251,214,214,110,131,190,25,95,38,203,192,221,39,201,184,102,22,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
