'Man from the East', a strange but fascinating stageshow featuring elements of Japanese Kabuki theatre, spawned the 'Red Buddha' album, which is the best demonstration of Yamashita's astounding technique as a percussionist.&quot; ***\n- John Swenson, Rolling Stone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac03a8ab9246fc7ecf6cd4546927f696e7a2023","amp;dn":"Stomu+Yamashta+-+Red+Buddha+%281973+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac03a8ab9246fc7ecf6cd4546927f696e7a2023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,192,58,138,185,36,111,199,236,246,205,69,70,146,127,105,110,122,32,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
