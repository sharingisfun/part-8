Following the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, Classic Rock revealed that the project originated with a band, named British Lion, which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s. Harris confirmed this during an interview with Classic Rock the following month, explaining that he became involved after &quot;Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them. After the original band split up, he &quot;kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.&quot; After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of &quot;six songs written with Richie and David, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.&quot;\nHarris has also stated that he intends to tour the album at some stage, remarking that, although &quot;there are no shows arranged yet&quot;, &quot;I know weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be playing clubs, which is great because IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve not played clubs for years&quot;.\nKerrang! deemed British Lion &quot;a brilliant album&quot;, describing it as &quot;the sound of an incredibly talented songwriter stepping outside of what he'd normally do and indulging himself in something a bit different with a group of excellent musicians.&quot; Metal Hammer were also positive towards the release, praising the &quot;infectious re-imaginings of the UFO and Thin Lizzy albums that inspired their creator as a kid,&quot; concluding that &quot;This is a big hearted and ferocious triumph.&quot; Although they criticised the album's lyrics, Classic Rock complimented vocalist Richard Taylor and guitarist Graham Leslie, concluding that &quot;British Lion is an album that is both exactly what you'd expect, and far better than that.&quot;\n\n1. &quot;This is my God&quot;              Steve Harris, David Hawkins, Richard Taylor 4:57\n2. &quot;Lost Worlds&quot;                 Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 4:58 \n3. &quot;Karma Killer&quot;                Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 5:29 \n4. &quot;Us Against the World&quot;        Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 4:12 \n5. &quot;The Chosen Ones&quot;             Harris, Taylor 6:27\n6. &quot;A World without Heaven&quot;      Standard 7:02\n7. &quot;Judas&quot;                       Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 4:58 \n8. &quot;Eyes of the Young&quot;           Harris, Leslie, Roberts, Taylor 5:25 \n9. &quot;These are the Hands&quot;         Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 4:28 \n10.&quot;The Lesson&quot;                  Harris, Hawkins, Taylor 4:15 \n\nTotal length: 52:11 \n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1306fcf0d3ace22a9369f2bd02f79c80cb823f3b","amp;dn":"Steve+Harris+-+British+Lion+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1306fcf0d3ace22a9369f2bd02f79c80cb823f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,6,252,240,211,172,226,42,147,105,242,189,2,247,156,128,203,130,63,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
