The last time QPR played at Old Trafford, Harry Redknapp watched from the stands before officially taking over as manager of the club. He was powerless to stop them being relegated to the Championship, but they are now back in the Premier League and are hoping to end a miserable run of results against the Red Devils. They have failed to register a victory over Manchester United in the Premier League and last beat them back in 1992, when they won 4-1 at Old Trafford. This match is also notable for Rio Ferdinand's return to Old Trafford. The defender made 454 appearances in a 12-year stay at Man Utd in which he won six league titles, two League Cups, one Champions League and a Club World Cup before joining QPR in the summer. Mark and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's matches.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19266d92393f93f4f66fdc57400bddfda3f79fdc","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-+14th+September+2014+-+HDTV+X264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19266d92393f93f4f66fdc57400bddfda3f79fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,38,109,146,57,63,147,244,246,111,220,87,64,11,221,253,163,247,159,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
