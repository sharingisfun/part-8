If you want real \n   expertise on the matter then use your powerfull friend Google. What really\n   matters here is that the movie is shown in the correct aspect ratio on the\n   telly! My english is second language so bear with me.\n    \n   Ok second, we have Film Aspect Ratio = Letterbox, CinemaScope, Panavision \n   etc. = 2.35:1, 1.85:1, 1.78:1, 1.66:1 ect. Film Aspect Ratio is the ratio of \n   the width of the visible area of the video/film frame to the height of the \n   visible area.\n\n   Then there's the &quot;black bars&quot;. In reality, these &quot;black bars&quot; are actually\n   unused areas of the image. These areas are black to allow for better contrast.\n   The wrongly called &quot;black bars&quot; is in fact part of the image! So if any part of\n   the black unused areas is cropped/cut of the image then the original\n   Aspect/Scope/Letterbox ratio is lost! For ever!\n\n   And then we have Encoding Aspect Ratio. For example full-resolution 2.35:1\n   anamorphic aspect ratio encoding is 2538x1080. Blu-Ray discs is 16:9 \n   (1920x1080) aspect ratio encoded. But the original Film Aspect Ratio is still\n   2.35:1 anamorphic/letterbox scope or 1.85:1 widescreen or what ever\n   film aspect ratio. All depending on what film aspect ratio/framing the Director\n   has chosen to use.\n  \n   So you have to differentiate between the two.\n\n   Third, Yes I know that a Blu-Ray player cannot playback anamorphic/letterbox\n   material (Film Aspect Ratio and Encoding Aspect Ratio) but the anamorphic/\n   letterbox scope, as mentioned above, is still in the transfer/encode, so for\n   this to work you have to rip the blu-Ray disc to PC, and play it back anamorphic\n   /Letterbox from there (Film Aspect Ratio). Or just grab one of Grym's uncropped\n   x264 rips and use that for anamorphic/Letterbox playback from PC. Let's move \n   on with the how's and do's of showing a correct 2.35:1 anamorphic/Letterbox \n   aspect ratio shot image on your 16:9 tv screen. \n\n   You can watch the movie in original 2.35:1 Anamorphic/Letterbox Scope,\n   like you do in the theater, by setting the aspect ratio in your software player\n   to 2.35:1. Aka Panavision, Cinemascope, Metrovision ect (Anamorphic/Letterbox) \n   \n   Display setting on your 16:9 flat screen you set to 1:1 pixel mapping or \n   whatever the name is on your telly. On my own Pioneer Kuro LX5090H  \n   16:9 flat tv it's called 'Dot by Dot'.\n\n   If set correct then the image on your 16:9 flat screen should look something\n   like the screen croppings on these pictures/images: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://someimage.com/Q2le&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://someimage.com/Q2le&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   You got image/screen cropping like on the pictures? \n   Now then please search 'Anamorphic Widescreen' in Youtube for more video\n   reference.\n   \n   Ok, now try doing same playback procedure with a cropped so-called &quot;2.35:1&quot;\n   1920x800 rip. 1920x800 cannot be 2.35:1 on a tv screen. It's impossible!\n   On a correct set tv screen it get's stretched to 1.85:1, because part of the \n   black areas are cropped of.\n\n   ---\n   \n   If you want to watch 1.85:1 aspect ratio movies in the correct aspect ratio\n   you then set the aspect ratio to 2.35:1, as well, and the image will have the\n   &quot;small&quot; black bars.\n\n   ---\n\n   Aspect ratios on 16:9 flat tv (Display setting on tv set to 1:1 pixel mapping):\n\n   1.33:1 - Black bars at sides of image (4:3) - Aka 1.37:1 Academy Standard\n\n   1.78:1 - Full screen. Image fills whole of screen (16:9) - HDTV &amp; Home Video\n\n   1.85:1 - Black bars Top &amp; Bottom of image (Small) - Movies, HDTV &amp; Home Video\n\n   2.35:1 - Black bars Top &amp; Bottom of image (Big) - Aka 2.40:1 &amp; Anamorphic Scope \n     \n\n3) Why don't You crop 2.35:1 Film Aspect Ratio Movies?\n\n   Read Here:                                \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.widescreen.org/index.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.widescreen.org/index.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n           \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                       \n                                          (-G-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea48ded3855e7b02d50c0245db0c372b3c408c99","amp;dn":"Jack.Ryan.Shadow.Recruit.2014.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD-7.1.x264-Grym","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea48ded3855e7b02d50c0245db0c372b3c408c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,72,222,211,133,94,123,2,213,12,2,69,219,12,55,43,60,64,140,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
