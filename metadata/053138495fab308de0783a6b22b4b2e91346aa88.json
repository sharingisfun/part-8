Weingarten\nPublished: 2010\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Academic\nASIN: B004ZWF0HC\nFormat: Retail Epub and Mobi\nReader Required:\nEpub- Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\nMobi- Kindle app, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\n\n\nChristopher R. Weingarten provides a thrilling account of how the Bomb Squad produced such a singular-sounding record: engineering, sampling, scratching, constructing, \n\ndeconstructing, reconstructing - even occasionally stomping\non vinyl that sounded too clean. Using production techniques that have never been duplicated, the Bomb Squad plundered\nand reconfigured their own compositions to make frenetic splatter collages; they played samples by hand together in a\nroom like a rock band to create a &quot;not quite right&quot; tension; they hand-picked their samples from only the ugliest squawks and sirens.\n\n\nWeingarten treats the samples used on Nation Of Millions as molecules of a greater whole, slivers of music that retain their own secret histories and folk traditions. Can the \n\nessence of a hip-hop record be found in the motives, emotions and energies of the artists it samples? Is it likely that something an artist intended 20 years ago would re-emerge \n\nanew? This is a compelling and thoroughly researched investigation that tells the story of one of hip-hop's landmark albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:053138495fab308de0783a6b22b4b2e91346aa88","amp;dn":"Public+Enemy%27s+It+Takes+a+Nation+of+Millions+to+Hold+Us+Back+%5BEp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"053138495fab308de0783a6b22b4b2e91346aa88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,49,56,73,95,171,48,141,224,120,58,107,34,180,178,233,19,70,170,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
