The authors discuss the major concepts and techniques involved in Bluetooth programming, with special emphasis on how they relate to other networking technologies. They provide specific descriptions and examples for creating applications in a number of programming languages and environments including Python, C, Java, GNU/Linux, Windows XP, Symbian Series 60, and Mac OS X. No previous experience with Bluetooth is assumed, and the material is suitable for anyone with some programming background. The authors place special emphasis on the essential concepts and techniques of Bluetooth programming, starting simply and allowing the reader to quickly master the basic concepts before addressing advanced features.\nBook Description\nThis book presents the essentials of Bluetooth in ways that make sense to a programmer and not in the ways laid out in the Bluetooth specification. The approach is to start simply, allowing the reader to quickly master the basic concepts before addressing advanced features. \n\n\n\n# Paperback: 208 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (September 3, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521703751\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521703758","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e2a4c9a84d96560e27e424061399d0d136c51a","amp;dn":"Bluetooth+Essentials+for+Programmers%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e2a4c9a84d96560e27e424061399d0d136c51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,226,164,201,168,77,150,86,14,39,228,36,6,19,153,208,209,54,197,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
