Both his work with the Eagles and his solo outings profile a grumpy romantic struggling to deal with the stresses and intrusions of the modern world, a man looking for love but a little too cynical to truly believe he can find it. This live set, recorded at a 1993 Labor Day benefit concert at Fox Bowl Stadium in Boston, functions as a kind of greatest-hits collection for Henley, spotlighting both key Eagles tracks (&quot;Hotel California,&quot; &quot;Desperado,&quot; &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;) and his solo hits (&quot;Boys of Summer,&quot; &quot;Dirty Laundry,&quot; &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;). Working with a full band, Henley's live versions of these songs are faithful to the original arrangements, and the whole set comes off as thoroughly professional, if even a little predictable. Jimmy Buffett joins him on-stage for &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Margaritaville,&quot; lightening things considerably and providing a needed balance. Nothing here will surprise anyone, but there's a certain comfort in that, as Henley delivers solid renditions of his best-known songs without any glittery frills, sung straight from the most cynical heart in pop.\nAll Music Review by Steve Leggett\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Hotel California\n[02] One Of These Nights\n[03] Desperado\n[04] End Of Innocence\n[05] Sunset Grill\n[06] Boys Of Summer\n[07] Life In The Fast Lane\n[08] Volcano\n[09] All She Wants To Do Is Dance\n[10] Margaritaville\n[11] Dirty Laundry\n[12] Well, Well, Well\n[13] The Heart Of The Matter\n\nPlay Time - 01h:11m:31s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 167mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
