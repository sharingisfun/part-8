Comprehensive and engaging, The Story of Ireland is an eye-opening account of a nation that has long been shaped by forces beyond its coasts.  \n\nThe Story of Ireland re-examines Irish history, challenging the accepted stories and long-held myths associated with Ireland. Transporting readers to the Ireland of the past, beginning with the first settlement in A.D. 433, this is a sweeping and compelling history of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dynamic nations. Hegarty examines how world events, including Europe's 16th century religious wars, the French and American revolutions, and Ireland's policy of neutrality during World War II, have shaped the country over the course of its long and fascinating history. With an up-to-date afterword that details the present state of affairs in Ireland, this is an essential text for readers who are fascinated by current events, politics, and history.\n\nSpanning Irish history from its earliest inhabitants to the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current financial crisis, The Story of Ireland is an epic and brilliant re-telling of IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history from a new point of view.\n\n\n\nNotes: \nOn the Kindle for Android (version 4.4.0.71) all blue links throughout the book work and you can zoom the maps. Aldiko (version 3.0.4), on the other hand, I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it to zoom the pictures, also noticed that not all the blue Ã¢â‚¬ËœNotesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ links work in both directions.\nThe device used in testing these two files is a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model).\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4818de27398a866839af996c732bcd484739b588","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+Ireland+ebook+Neil+Hegarty+mobi+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4818de27398a866839af996c732bcd484739b588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,24,222,39,57,138,134,104,57,175,153,108,115,43,205,72,71,57,181,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
