However, Black Adam's real target is the World's Mightiest MortalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Captain Marvel. He returns to Earth following his 5,000 years of exile to wreak havoc on Earth only to end up fighting Superman and Captain Marvel. After a long battle, he is defeated by Captain Marvel but spared his life. When Tawky Tawny arrives, Black Adam identifies him as Shazam's lackey.
