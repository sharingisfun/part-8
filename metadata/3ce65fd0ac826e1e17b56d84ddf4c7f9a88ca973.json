We'll learn how to implement robust and intuitive rigging features with the help of custom channels and the Node Editor, how to rig with deformers, as well as skinning techniques that we can utilize to get great results from our deformations while saving time in the process.\n\nWe'll even learn how Maya's interface can be customized to help us work a little faster. By the end of this training, you will be comfortable enough with Maya's rigging tools to rig your own assets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ce65fd0ac826e1e17b56d84ddf4c7f9a88ca973","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Rigging+in+Maya+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ce65fd0ac826e1e17b56d84ddf4c7f9a88ca973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,230,95,208,172,130,110,30,23,181,109,132,221,244,199,249,168,140,169,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
