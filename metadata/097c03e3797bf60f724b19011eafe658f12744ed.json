During the early '70s, the band had 12 straight Top Ten hits, including &quot;You Are Everything,&quot; &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow,&quot; &quot;I'm Stone in Love With You,&quot; &quot;Break Up to Make Up,&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New.&quot; Of all their peers, the Stylistics were one of the smoothest and sweetest soul groups of their era. All of their hits were ballads, graced by the soaring falsetto of Russell Thompkins, Jr. and the lush yet graceful productions of Bell, which helped make the Stylistics one of the most successful soul groups of the first half of the '70s.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-p5549/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-p5549/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Ron Wynn):\n\nAnother anthology, this one covering the beautiful love songs and romantic ballads that were The Stylistics' specialty. These are all magnificent, some of the finest sentimental soul that's ever been recorded. But it's also been issued before, and Amherst's mastering isn't anything to write home about, especially the way they tend to wash out Russell Tompkins, Jr.'s high notes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-love-hits-r19256&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-love-hits-r19256&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001O85&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001O85&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
