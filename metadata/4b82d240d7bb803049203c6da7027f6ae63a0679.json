His arguments and thesis were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism.  These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist parties, as well as the problem of the &quot;cult of personality&quot; and of ideology.\r\n\r\nAlthusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of structuralism.  He is remembered as the scourge of humanist Marxism who was famously pilloried by E. P. Thompson in his polemic &quot;The Poverty of Theory&quot; as &quot;Geschichtenscheissenschlopff -- unhistorical shit.&quot;\r\n\r\nAlthusser's work continues to inform the research programs of literary studies, political philosophy, history, economics, and sociology.  His philosophy as a whole is undergoing a critical reevaluation by scholars who have benefited from the anthologization of hard-to-find and previously unpublished texts and who have begun to engage with the great mass of writings that remain in his archives.  His concepts are also being increasingly employed by philosophers, political theorists, and activists who have returned to Marx and to Marxian analyses in order to explain and to envision alternatives to our present socio-economic conjuncture.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* FOR MARX (Verso, 2005).
