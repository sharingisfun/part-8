Still, it's a shifting collage of sound that pulls you from Algeria one moment to Jamaica the next and then manages to mix India with Ireland. \nThere seems to be a little more balance this time, too, with far less drastic shifts. \nCongenial fun, good to dance to, and a terrific album to have playing all the time. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\nThis is Jah Wobble's most accessible album. \nBut that said, it's far from being mainstream, it's too complex, too beautiful. No song is like one other, the music changes, language, singers, rhythm, mood, prose, everything changes - akin to the Red Queen who runs to stay in place, JW moves about building a solid, lasting masterpiece, which yet remains elusive, fluent in all tongues, an abode of the restless. \nIn the first sentence of &quot;Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; Gabriel Garcia Marquez depicts a man facing execution while remembering a certain occasion when he was a little boy. The lyrics of &quot;I love everybody&quot;, exclaimed with a ranting and callous voice, are similarly cruel but upraising, touching life and beyond. &quot;Becoming more like God&quot; is one of the strangest songs I've ever heard - Pop meets/becomes God, a hymn for a church yet to be founded. \nIf you think this seems all too weird, and who is Jah Wobble anyway? don't be put off - the music is fantastic.
